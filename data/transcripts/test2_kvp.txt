A piece of Sammy 's construction ? What do you want , demolitions , cement or garbage ? You want trucks , meat , fish , garment ? So the fuck do I ! Anybody got any ideas ? - I got one or two . - Yeah ? - Here 's the money ! - What the fuck ? Johnny ! Come on ! Do n't think for one minute you 're not diggin ' into Angie 's drug operation .

I do n't let anyone whack out my crew . Now , is that what you want ? Good . What do you say the three of us go down to Umberto 's ... we get some scungillis , we relax . I 'm relaxed . I 'm plenty relaxed . I 'm goin ' down to Regine 's , have a drink with DiB . I smell like a fuckin ' animal now . Hey , to each his own . There 's big bucks in it . That 's for sure . Hey , fuck this shit . They lock you up forever . Money ai n't a good enough reason to do a hundred years . You like this joint , huh ? It 's classy . Classy ? You got any idea how much money this place must gross in a month ?
zone2	know what I mean ? But he 's right . I would n't mind a piece of this place myself . Let me ask you something , John . How come you do n't have a piece of anything legitimate ? DiB and me , we 're in drywall , construction , demolition , night clubs . Legitimate , huh ? You know what I think is bullshit ? You should become CPAs . I 'm serious . Certified Public Assholes . This way you could have your legitimate businesses ... and your books and your workman 's comp ... and your Blue Cross and your Blue Shield . And on top of that , you go pay your taxes , all right ? You think I got a button to become some kind of straight-up businessman ? - Get the fuck outta here . - You know what I think ? Under these $2,000 suits , you 're really an old-timer . Yeah , man . Got ta remember where we come from . Amen . Your boss is so busy bein ' a businessman ... I ca n't
zone2	What 's that about ? Not just our boss . Do n't get me wrong . I know . Yeah , he 's my boss . He 's my boss . Off the record , I 'd been happy to see Neil get it . Off the record , I do n't think anybody woulda cried ... if Mr . Neil got it . But , you know , it 's Cosa Nostra . We got the boss we got . Here 's to changing ' the subject . To the boss ! - I got ta get goin ' . - Where you goin ' ? - Business or pleasure ? - What the fuck 's the difference ? - There he goes . - Take care . - Come here , you . - I 'll call you tomorrow . A million a month gross , minimum . I could be off by 50% . Fuckin ' Sammy . You know that contract we got in Queens ? We 're the low bidders , but it turns out it 's like one of those " modified " bids
zone2	where we ca n't make any money . Nicki , come here . Take down that piece of drywall up there , the one on the top . For what ? For what ? ' Cause maybe you ai n't buyin ' the kinda quality that you should . You do n't trust nobody , man . - What ? - Oh , fuck . What are you doing ? Are you fuckin ' nuts ? When I first picked up this piece of shit , I knew it was a mistake . - We 're family . - Son of a bitch . I 'm Deborah 's brother , for God 's sake ! Shut the fuck up , Nicki ! Do n't kill me , please ! What did I do ? You know somethin ' ? You are some whiner . Oh , God ! - Jesus , John . I 'm so sorry . - Hey , Sammy . How are ya ? Who done this ? Leave it alone . It was an accident . Just had an accident , that 's all . This
zone2	. This is John 's friends and family . Just stay here . Thanks for comin ' , man . Who did this , Joe ? The guy that lives next door . His name is Favara . My God , I am heartily sorry ... for having offended Thee . And I detest all past sins ... for Thy just punishment . But most of all I have offended Thee . Oh , God ... you 're deserving of all my love . I from here resolve to the top of Thy grace ... to sin no more . Is this gon na take long ? It 's 20,000 bucks I 'm pickin ' up . We can afford a few minutes . I 'll be right back . Somebody 's got ta move this thing or they 're not gon na have headlights ! I 'll be out in a minute . I 'll move the car in a minute . Hey , big shot , is this yours ? Is that yours ? Relax . I 'll be out in a minute . Is that yours ?
zone2	I 'm sorry . What 'd you say ? Is that yours ? - Is what mine ? - The Lincoln . What Lincoln ? - Let him go ! - Calm down , man ! Let go ! John , a cop ! Get the fuck outta here ! Mr . Cutler , what 's the real story here ? There is no real story . My client was tryin ' to break up a fight . What does this have to do with loan-sharking ? - Did he owe you money ? - Do n't be ridiculous . Mr . Gotti sells plumbing supplies . That 's all . Leave the man alone ! Leave the man alone ! What was your reaction to these accusations ? Take that . Do you always hand out fifties to street people ? Is that a fifty ? Take a hundred . Give me back the fifty . It 's tough on the streets . Everybody 's got ta score once in a while . - That 's why your neighborhood loves you . - Could be . How does it
zone2	guess is that once this Piecyk finds out who you are ... he 'll withdraw . But there 's a bigger problem comin ' up . Not with you . With your people . What do you mean , my people ? Angelo Ruggeirio , your brother Gene , D'Mig ... on a heroin conspiracy ... indictment 's comin ' down this afternoon . - Are you fuckin ' kiddin ' me ? - I 'm not kiddin ' you . And the really bad news is Angie 's house has been bugged for months . Jesus Christ . That stupid , greedy , motherfuckin ' moron ! Goddamn him ! Goddamn him ! Paul is gon na whack the three of them . Yeah . And me too . I got Moe , I got Larry , and I got Curly . The bail I raised for you three , I 'll be broke here a fuckin ' year ! How many times we got ta go through this ? We 're in the street , scratchin ' and scraping ' , so we took a taste . We
zone2	do you get caught on a bug in your own house ? Motherfuckers ! Do n't say motherfuckers , all right ? Even when you were a kid , you do n't shut your fuckin ' mouth . That 's why I called you Quack-Quack . They do n't have to bug you . Anyone in New York dials seven digits to get you . I had my house swept by this electronic expert . The motherfucker told me it was safe . - Safe ? - Yeah . Have you heard of technology ? There is no " safe . " Do n't you know they got a parabolic mike today ? It could hear a fuckin ' snake fart in Egypt ! The Feds are a machine . They do n't run out of time or money ! They sent a whole fuckin ' army to grab 30 spics ... in that Caribbean shithole , whatever the fuck it was . That 's power , Angelo . That 's real power . You shut the fuck up for a minute . I 'm tryin ' to make a
zone2	have that made the bosses ... ban the goddamn drugs in the first place ! Every fuckin ' boss of every family 's into drug money , off the record . Paul 's full of shit . He 's takin ' fuckin ' drug money from Roy De Meo . He do n't ask where the cash comes from , but he knows . - So he 's a hypocrite ? - Yeah . Is this somethin ' new ? He 's the boss ! Do you get it ? He 's the boss . - How bad are these tapes ? - Forget about it . I said a lot of shit about people , about Paul too . - Paul , good swim ? - I should be doin ' more of this . Helps me sleep better . I sat down with the Colombos ... and those asbestos removal contracts ... that you guys got in with the Board of Ed . Anyhow , I agreed to up their end of it to 40 percent . - 40 percent ? - Jesus , Paul . They do
zone2	now . I know for a fact when Don Carlo was alive , they were lucky to get ten . Don Carlo 's been dead for a long time now . And Neil , when Neil goes , that 's the end of that regime . Finished . This is a new age . We got more money to make ... workin ' with the other families than shutting ' them out . Me and the Colombos ... we also had a little talk about our John Gotti problem . What John Gotti problem ? - What 's the matter withJohnny ? - You mean the Ruggeirio thing ? What John Gotti problem ? What problem ? Do n't you guys fuckin ' read ? Give me that newspaper . When the New York Times carries it , you got trouble . I had dinner last week with this chicken guy . What 's his name ? Looks like a chicken . What 's he gon na think when he sees these headlines ? These guys are not stupid . They know who we are . But it 's not
zone2	like some throw back to our street days . Goes to work on some guy with a baseball bat in the street ! The guy jumped him with a bat . John 's got a temper . So what ? - The guy 's a hell of ... - What ? An earner ? Yeah , I know . What the hell is it with these $3,000 suits ? The man dresses better than Cuomo . And these FBI bugs . Who knows what 's on those fuckin ' tapes ? Do you ? Who the hell knows what kind of shit that fat fuck Angie talked about me . Anyway , if we got ta whack John and his crew ... the Colombos are givin ' us the soldiers to do it . Who 's talkin ' about whacking'John Gotti ? This way , it keeps us from having war within the family . Paul , as your consigliere , I have an obligation to tell you this . It 's not right for us to reveal family problems in front of the Colombos . - It weakens us
zone2	show that Angie and those two other Mamelukes ... are dealin ' powder , the rule since 1957 is deal and die . I got ta clip ' em , and Johnny Boy too . What 's up , fellas ? Can we go off the record here ? - Absolutely . - All right . What Carlo built up for 30 years with his blood ... this prick is givin ' away piece by piece . The other families are gon na piss all over us . He 's not tryin ' to build . Mark my words , Sammy . We 're gon na starve with this guy . Off the record , I agree with you 100 percent . I 'll tell you one other thing . This guy do n't understand for one fuckin ' minute who Gotti is . You all right ? You got ta get to a hospital . - You hear me ? - What good would that do ? They just wan na shoot that toxic shit into me , and I ... I 'll die that much sooner . I
zone2	na leave a war behind me . He would be within his rights . Paul has every right to whack out your whole crew . " Deal and die . " That was Carlo 's edict . Right , right . And that 's why Carlo Gambino was n't taking ' drug money off De Meo like Paul . Paulie ai n't one tenth of Carlo Gambino . You know that . Carlo ran this family like it was supposed to be run . Like a brotherhood . But it was our thing . Paulie runs it like it 's his thing . Carlo would step out of the grave . He 'd set this whole thing right , if he could . Nobody in my crew is gettin ' clipped . That 's all . If anybody 's gettin ' clipped , it 's Paul . I brought you into this family . I made you what you are . You 're strong and you 're smart . But do n't ever believe that you are bigger than anything ... - I do n't think I 'm bigger ...
zone2	I know what you 're thinkin ' . But you can not whack out a boss . Only the full commission could make that call . I love you like a son ... but do n't ever put me on the spot . And do n't ever force my hand . I would never do that . Let 's take a walk , huh ? I got ta tell you , we ca n't clear this with any of the bosses . It 's our family , it 's our move . Nobody gives a fuck ... about this greedy cazzo . - When ? - Not until Neil goes . All right , DiB 's with us all the way . De Cicco says you ought a get all the cappo regimes together ... and make ' em vote right away . That 'll make it official . He can deliver Joe Armone out of retirement to sit next to you . That ought a give it some weight . You 're gon na be underboss . You ready ? Frankie De Cicco will be consigliere . With him
zone2	Pull it tight like no government nowhere is ever gon na break this . We 're gon na make a powerhouse now . A Cosa Nostra ai n't seen since Anastasia . Anastasia ? Shit , this is bigger than killing ' the fuckin ' president . Hey , you think I was put on this Earth to make them rich and me poor ? We 're gon na do a hit now . We 're gon na do a real hit . We 're goin ' back . Back to some real in-your-face Cosa Nostra . Out in front on the line . Make ' em sit back and watch the volcano blow . You with me ? I 'm with you . All the way to the finish . We had it all . The booze , the girls . Pockets full of money . I had a girl . Was that that Irish girl ? Yeah . I could go two , three days without sleep . My God . I was so strong . You know , you live this goddamn life long enough ... and
zone2	honor . Do n't ever lose that , Johnny . This whole fuckin ' thing ... lasts only five minutes . He 's gone ... and that fuck Castellano never even come say good-bye . What did DeCicco need this meetin ' for ? I got shopping ' to do . Probably another beef about the fuckin ' garbage routes . Yeah , more garbage . It 's gon na cost us another 20 bucks to park this thing . We ought to get into these Manhattan parking lots . It 's a license to steal . Let me out . - La famiglia ! - La famiglia ! Here he comes . Hey , John , who 's your tailor ? Mr . Gotti , did you have anything to do with the Paul Castellano murder ? Is it true you 're the new boss of the Gambino family ? I ask you to look around the courtroom , Mr . Piecyk ... and identify the man who assaulted you . I do n't see him . Take off your glasses , please . Now , study the defendant
zone2	under oath . You have never before seen this man ? Yeah , I seen Mr . Gotti on TV and the newspapers . I never met the man . Are you telling this court that John Gotti ... is not the same man you incriminated on an assault warrant ? It was a long time ago . I do n't remember . I 'm sorry . Any further questions , Mr . Bartley ? - No , Your Honor , I think it 's clear . - Mr . Cutler . Your Honor ... I respectfully move for a dismissal ... of all charges . Motion granted . There he is ! You beat ' em , John ! I ca n't believe this son of a bitch . Every time he beats a rap , his popularity goes up . - He 's making us look like idiots . - Our day will come , believe me . See the fireworks on the way over ? John 's tossing a block party for beating the case . Yeah , right . Everybody loves him . He whacks out
zone2	are the New York cops ? And now it 's some unsolved homicide . Now this Piecyk thing . How do you think this egomaniac must feel ? Untouchable . Son of a bitch is sitting on a $500 million-a-year enterprise ... and he knows how to spread it around . Correction . He 's sitting on top of a $500 million-a-year criminal enterprise . This is no Fortune 500 company he 's running here . Are you forgetting the prosecutor spent the last year ... building a RICO case against him ? You guys do n't get it . I want this guy . So spread the money around . Offer immunity to some hard-timers . We 'll spend 24 hours a day in that room if we have to . I do not care ! He 's doing business somewhere in the building . We find out where , we got him . I do not want this son of a bitch as the next mayor of New York . Only Sally . He gets arrested in a rented Mercedes . I think the Feds wired his mailbox
zone2	. They find two Berettas in the glove compartment ... and an axe under the front seat . A fuckin ' axe , right ? So they 're lookin ' at him . They say ... " You got any idea why there 's two handguns in the glove box ... and an axe under the front seat ? " Sally says , " Are you serious ? I will never rent a car from fuckin ' Avis again . " Hey , Bruce ! Get over here , you cocksucker . Where you been ? - Long story . - Yeah ? I thought you should know this sooner than later . I got something for you , but strictly off the record . So we 'll go upstairs . Come on . - Who 's place is this ? - Mikey Cirelli's . - I thought he was dead . - He is . Maybe that 's why there 's nobody here . So what 's goin ' on ? U.S . Attorney 's office has been working a whole year on a RICO case ... against you
zone2	Damn these fucks . - I 'm sorry . - They do n't let you live . - Yeah , I know . Let me go through this RICO thing again . It says if anyone anywhere is caught doin ' anything wrong ... then everyone is guilty up and down the line . Wait a minute . This is a law ... Yeah , it is the government 's license to throw out the Constitution . If they can prove that somebody is part of a continuing criminal enterprise ... they can lock ' em up for life . " Continuing criminal enterprise . " I do n't know what the fuck that means . Did they lock up Nixon for life when they raided ... his Democratic National Headquarters , whatever the fuck they were ? The Plumbers . He had an ongoing criminal enterprise his entire career . That 's a RICO case . The assistant U.S . Attorney on this case does not see you as a defendant . - To her , you 're some kind of trophy . - " Her " ? Who
zone2	. - Would you forget about it ? No brush named Giacalone is gon na be jerkin ' me off for long . And would you tell her to leave us the fuck alone ? And another thing , I do n't wan na be alone tonight . You remember ? Who was the guy ? Tony Rigoletto . No . Rigoletto is an opera . - It was Tony Rigatto . - I 'm talkin ' about opera . The guy could sing an entire opera in Italian word for word ... did n't speak a word of Italian . He was like an idiot savant . These guys are retarded , but they do one thing perfect . How come only servants can do this stuff ? - Savant ! - What servant ? You fuckin ' idiot ! You know , I got ta say this . - You got everyone 's respect here . - Thanks , John . I mean that . I was gon na say you dress classy too ... but I do n't want you to get a swell head . Thanks
zone2	machine . It 's good to be treated as a friend . Hey , you are a friend , and Sammy G 's a friend ... and what is with this guy ? His fuckin ' wife has got him home 6:00 every night . Unless he 's out whacking somebody . Mr . Gotti ? Mr . Gotti ? Hi . Nice to meet you . My name 's Roger , and this is my wife , Ann . We came in from Rochester for the weekend ... and no one 's gon na believe we actually met you . We just got married . They just got married ! Give ' em a bottle of champagne . - Thank you very much . - Get his autograph . I 'll give you an autograph . Tommy , come here . Thank you very much . John Gotti , I 'm FBI Agent Russo , this is Agent Gabriel . Russo . You know what FBI means , right ? Why do n't you tell me . " Forever Bother the Italians . " An FBI bug has picked
zone2	No kidding . A capo in the Bonanno Family has been recorded stating ... that the Commission has sanctioned a hit on you . Thanks for the tip . We have a legal and moral obligation to inform you . Legal and moral , is it ? Let 's not bullshit each other . - You 'd be happy to see me go . - Not at all . We 're gon na take you down ourselves . Mr . Gotti , what are your feelings about the RICO law ? John , are you ready for the end of this trial ? I 'm always ready . Are you the boss of the Gambino family ? I 'm a member of the Gotti family . My wife Vicki 's the boss . For seven torturous months ... the government has been trying to sell you on this indictment . This indictment stinks . And a fancy wine dressing called RICO is n't going to make it any better . It 's still rancid . It is still rotten . Still makes you retch and vomit . To be brief
zone2	no case . You can convict John Gotti because he curses on the telephone . You can convict John Gotti because he gambles excessively . - You can convict John Gotti ... - You see Juror Number 5 ? Because he lives a life style which you may or may not ... What about him ? - But that is not ... - We own him . What my client is charged with ! - Worst-case , it 's a hung jury . - You want to get John Gotti ? You do it the right way . Do it the American way . The jury has reached a verdict . Defendant Joseph Dimiglia : Not guilty on all counts . Yes ! That 's what I been tellin ' youse . If you ca n't control your selves ... you will spend the next 30 days in this building ... - and if you think that I 'm kidding ... - Are we in grade school ? - I invite you to try it . - This is bullshit . Defendant Angelo Ruggiero : Not guilty on all counts
zone2	. Defendant John Gotti : Not guilty on all counts . John Gotti has beaten a federal RICO case . After seven months of testimony ... Gotti has once again proven to be immune to government efforts to convict him . The " Dapper Don " is now the " Teflon Don . " - Can I have your view on the trial ? - John Gotti ? Have you ever walked into the Boys ' Club on the East Side ? Every bit of equipment bought by John Gotti . Ma'am , can I have your view on the trial ? We love him . The government should just leave the poor man alone . Perhaps the most personable gangland boss ever to grace the Big Apple . John Gottis , in underworld terms ... the undisputed " King of the Volcano . " You rule , John ! You know why the people in this city love me ? I 'm beatin ' the same system now that 's fuckin ' them every day . Everybody loves a celebrity gangster . You forget your father was a rich
zone2	outside . They know . They know I know . Whatever you say , John . You know , Frankie ... why would a guy born of money choose our life ? - Hey , Angie . - What ? Three guys sittin ' in a car . Mexican , black guy and a Puerto Rican . - Who 's drivin ' ? - The black guy . - Puerto Rican . - The police . - You seen a fuckin ' doctor ? - No . Will you please go see Gennaro on Prince Street ? Bulldoze your way in . Do n't sit in no waiting ' room . If I 'm gon na see a doctor , I 'm gon na see a Jew doctor . Jews , Wops , Chinks , Zulus ... It 's one world , it 's one people . Would you stop it with that shit ? Not when it comes to doctors . John , I got ta talk to you private for a minute . What 's the matter ? All right . Tell Vic I 'll be up in
zone2	. - The guy ca n't wait ? Tell him I 'll be in there . Go on . What is it ? I heard DiB sayin ' some things . He says if you 're goin ' away on this RICO thing , Sammy should be the boss . - That 's bullshit . - No , it ai n't ! I know you 're pissed off at me , but it 's true . I 'm not pissed at you . I do n't trust you . You put my tit in the ringer on that goddamn dope beef . I love you , all right ? I just do n't trust you . - That 's how it started with Paul . - What started with Paul ? DiB 's talkin ' subversive , and Sammy 's right next to him . DiB is solid , and so is Sammy . Put out the fucking cigarettes and see a doctor . Come on . Stop that . Where is everybody ? I think Gene 's at Sheepshead Bay with your mother . Pete 's downtown lookin '
zone2	buyin ' . - That son of a bitch ... - I really do n't wan na know . It 's just an expression . So , consigliere ... Angie says DiB is talkin ' subversive . There 's nothin ' to that , right ? DiB 's a solid guy . Between us , Angie 's just a little jealous ... that me and Sammy got the slots we did after Paulie went . They do n't like you spending so much time with DiB . Forget about it , Johnny . Normal family bullshit . Where is Sammy today ? He 's working . Hey . You know the guy got a $13 million contract ... to build a new school in Brighton Beach ? This guy 's a wonder . He opens a business a minute . Since you made him underboss , nobody can keep up with him . In a few years , between him and DiB ... they 're gon na own all of Brooklyn . This guy , O'Connor , head of the 608 Union ? He trashed the place ' cause Tommy
zone2	was under your flag . I was ready to whack the guy ... but I mentioned it to dib . He said I ought to run it by you . What is this ? You and DiB discuss who gets whacked and who do n't ? Who the fuck is the boss , may I ask ? We were n't discussing ' anything . I mentioned it to dib in passing . He waved the flag . - It ai n't no big fuckin ' deal . - I hear he 's promoting ' you for boss . I do n't think he was talkin ' out of turn . - DiB was thinkin ' of the family . - He 's thinking . He got no right to think it . I just spent half a million on legal fees . I 'm sitting on the griddle for seven fuckin ' months . I got you and DiB laying ' me down . What kind of friend is that ? Get the fuck outta here , layin ' you down . What are you talkin ' about ? What
zone2	courtroom for seven months . Now I got Gene and Angie 's drug trial . Then the FBI pops up in the men 's room every time I take a piss . I 'm talkin ' about my blood pressure ! That 's what I 'm talkin ' about . - Forget I said anything . - You got it . You really worried about this thing ? I mean , you want me to keep an eye on DiB or what ? Yeah . Keep an eye on him . Come here . Take care of yourself . I 'm worried about your blood pressure . Do n't be eatin ' all that greasy shit . Seven fuckin ' months . Seven fuckin ' months that RICO case had me tied up . - They do n't let you live . - Seven months of my life . I know . They do n't let you live . Speaking of time , we got that 3 o'clock in midtown . - What time is it now ? - Time to go . Tell ' em I ca n't break
zone2	with Sammy . You goin ' into Manhattan ? Good . - See you later . - We 'll do it tomorrow . Jimmy , thanks for everything . Put it on Sammy 's tab . Sure . Ciao . So , Cheech , you wan na drop me off at Mulberry Street ? - Yeah . - Okay , let 's go . You wan na talk about Fourth Avenue or whatever the fuck it was ? What Fourth Avenue ? Fuckin ' Buick . Who 's not here ? Is anybody missing ? - Tommy Marino ai n't here ! - He 's in Florida ! I do n't see DiB . DiB ai n't here ! DiB ai n't here . I know you come from upstate , Connecticut , Jersey . I 'm not gon na keep youse here . I heard some of youse talkin ' . Nobody knows who killed Frankie DeCicco . So do n't ask . Nobody 's got to look over their shoulder . Tell your crews to stay calm . You 're the Gambino family . And do n't you
zone2	... is gon na fuck with us . Now , go home and drive carefully . Believe me , that 's the most dangerous part of your lives . Thank you for bein ' here . Man , that car . You ought a see that fuckin ' car . This just could be a renegade element , that 's all . Maybe it 's one of Tommy Bilotti 's people . Hey , Frankie DeCicco set up the meeting with Big Paul . Payback time . Yeah , but the question is , is it over ? There was nothin ' left of that fuckin ' car . - How are you , Joe ? - I 'm good . Good . Jordan , espresso . For sure you were supposed to be in that car with Frankie . We goin ' to war ? They took their shot . They 'll be satisfied with one for one and give you a pass . But you got even bigger problems . Yeah ? You selling ' the special here , or you tellin ' fortunes today ? Do n't
zone2	. I went to your inauguration . I held my nose , but I went . What did you have to hold your nose about ? I 'm just curious . I got every right to talk this way . I was at the sit-down with Neil and Paul and Don Carlo ... after you clipped Galione . You broke a rule then , but Neil got you a pass . Then you broke another rule . You whacked out a boss without a Commission okay . Excuse me . I 'm supposed to get a Commission okay ... while my family is being bled to death ? Hey , fuck Paul . He deserved it . That 's got nothing to do with it . The rules are for everybody . Right now , on a street in Brooklyn , there 's a young kid . He works himself up , and he talks to dib , he talks to Gravano ... he talks to three or four capos , and you get a bullet in your head . We survive by our rules . And now you 're
zone2	goin ' fuckin ' public . On TV and magazine covers . These fancy suits , these fancy haircuts . " John Gotti , John Gotti . " Do n't give me that shit . I did n't ask to go public . They shove their cameras and microphones in my face . Get the fuck outta here . You 're turning this thing of ours into entertainment ... for everyone who watches the six o'clock news . But our thing is secret . Secret . And what you 're doin ' wo n't work . You believe you can keep spitting in the government 's face ... and get away with it ? You 're making them come after you . What do you think , Joe ? You do n't think the FBI knows who you are ? Your face has n't been on the wall next to mine ... for the last 20 years ? Get outta here . They know me . I know who I am . I 'm not embarrassed by who I am . I 'm not gon na sit in the dark
zone2	maybe I 'll get respect . I 'm not gettin ' any here . John , you made a hell of a long walk ... from a cockroach tenement to the cover of Time magazine . That takes ability . But a Cosa Nostra boss do n't belong on the cover of Time magazine . Wherever I 'm at , it 's ' cause I am who I am . I 'm not gon na change or apologize for who I am . But you 'll wind up in a cell ... because you are who you are . And you 'll take a lot of good people with you . Duck , John . Learn to duck sometimes . No more comments about me lowering myprofile .

Fuckin'Sammy . - It 's making me sick . - I 've heard enough . Defendants shall be held without bail . I 'm also granting the government 's motion ... to disqualify present defense counsel . Cutler , Shargel and Pollok have to be disqualified ... because their role as house counsel was discussed in taped conversations ... that the
zone2	that , there are also conflict of interest issues ... because of prior representation of potential witnesses . Therefore , the lawyers could be called as witnesses in this trial . The defendants are advised to appear before me at ... 9:30 a.m . , Monday the 23rd , with new counsel . Court is adjourned . We 're gon na have to release them into the prison population . The judge ruled that keeping them in isolation is punitive . Okay . So tell the warden to put Gravano in with Gotti . What about LoCascio ? Does n't matter . Put him anywhere . Sammy 's the key . What do you say , Sammy ? How could you say those things about me , John ? Tapes are tapes , man . Do n't mean nothing . I 'm talkin ' , right ? I can fuckin ' talk , ca n't I ? Yeah , some fuckin ' talk . You backdoored me ... while I was your underboss and I was whacking ' guys for you . Hey . Get the fuck outta here with

I said , " Do what you want . " Same with Louie Malito . The same with Scibetta ... your own brother-in-law , for chrissakes . What am I talkin ' about ? What about Tommy Spinelli ? Eddie Garafalo ? Mickey whatever-the-fuck-his name was . Worst of all , DiB . You come into a ton of fuckin ' money when DiB went . Ton of fuckin ' money . Do n't ever deny that . - Do n't you ever fuckin ' deny that . - Let 's not rewrite history here . I did n't mind DiB goin ' . Fuckin ' playboy instead of a business partner . But you wanted it , and when John Gotti wanted somebody in the ground ... John Gotti called Sammy Gravano . - You barked , I bit , remember ? - " You bit " ? You
zone2	name . My name ! You 're a selfish prick . You 're greedy is your fuckin ' problem . This is all my fault now ? It 's not yours , with all your $2,000 suits ... and all your front-page " Dapper Don " shit ? Even your lawyer did n't know how to pull it in . You beat the government , you 're supposed to walk away humble . You 're not supposed to stand in front of TV cameras crowing ' about it ... ' cause it 's gon na come back in your face . I got news for you . It ai n't me on those tapes . Truth is , it 's your big mouth that brought this borgata down . Let me ask you something . If Neil himself come up with the widow Cirelli 's apartment ... and Joe Watts swept it , how am I supposed to know it was bugged ? Sammy , what do they got ? They got some tapes . They got no witnesses . They got tapes . So , let ' em play
zone2	em leak . I do n't give a fuck . It 's like hearin ' the same song over and over again . You play it enough , you do n't hear it no more . You hear me ? All right . Whatever you say , John . - What ? - Your friend , Gravano ... was just escorted from the building . Thought you might like to know . Sit . I think we all know why we 're here . I 've got a lot to offer . And I got a lot of concerns . So I 'm thinking that maybe we can make a deal . What kind of deal ? If I talk , I walk . Impossible . You 'll have to do time . - How much ? - Less than 20 . And whatever 's worked out , we 'll be obliged to inform Gotti 's lawyer . Once that happens , word is out . Everything 's gon na come out in the trial , right ? Everything . So when Deborah finds out I killed her brother ,
zone2	part of my life is over . So what 's your motive , Sammy ? Revenge ? Repentance ? What ? What are you talkin ' about ? You heard those tapes . John and I are finished . So either I spend the rest of my life in jail ... or I 'm out on the streets . Either way , I 'm dead . So what kind of information you have to offer ? I 'll give you the whole Cosa Nostra . I 'll give you the Paul Castellano hit . I 'll testify that I personally fixed the Giacalone jury . I 'll give you the murders of Louie DiBono , Louie Malito ... Mickey De Batt , Robert DiBernardo ... Tommy Spinelli , Willy Boy Johnson ... a dozen or so more . Tommy Sparrow . I 'll give you the John O'Connor shooting .

Salvatore " Sammythe Bull " Gravano ... underboss of the notorious Gambino crime family ... has agreed to testify against

Gravano ... with a single count of racketeering . Known as " The Bull " among associates ... Sammy Gravano has been seen for years in the constant company of Mr . Gotti . Gravano was said to be trusted by Gotti completely . Federal officials today were elated at the defection of Mr . Gravano ... What you got now ? You got Sammy . What 's he doin ' with his life ? Where 's he goin ' ? You know the Feds , they see the guy ... they always smell out the guy with no parameters . They move right in . This whole RICO statute bullshit ... is designed for the rats by the rats . You show me that Wall Street bum . He stole billions from the country . Walked outta the goddamn courtroom with billions in his back pockets . Frankie , you show me the bum in that chemical company . In one fuckin
zone2	people in an instant . Did he do his instant ? You show me any important thief in today 's business world ... who 's denied his counsel of choice . And they fire my lawyer ? Is this America ? We 're wops , John . We 're fools . You know why ? ' Cause we did it . We let Sammy into something that 's called " a thing of ours . " And you know what ? On my mother I say this : Let Sammy have his millions , let him have his witness protection . ' Cause every day he 's still gon na wake up to the rat ... staring ' him in the mirror . He 's gon na have nothin ' . I 'm gon na sit right here ... and still with me ... there 's gon na be Cosa Nostra ... till I die . The government calls Salvatore Gravano . Will you raise your right hand , please ? Put your left hand on the Bible . Do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth
zone2	God ? - I do . - You can sit down . Mr . Gravano , do you have a nickname ? Excuse me ? Do your friends call you Salvatore ? Would you keep your voice up , please ? That microphone is n't on . Do your friends call you Salvatore ? No . What do your friends call you ? Sammy . My friends call me Sammy . Sammy , would you describe your position in the Gambino crime family ... relative to the defendant , Mr . Gotti ? He was the boss , and I was the underboss . And did you commit murder and other crimes ... as part of your association with Mr . Gotti and the Gambino crime family ? Yes . In addition to Mr . Gotti ... are there other members of the Gambino crime family in this courtroom ... The defendants will rise . Clerk will read the verdict . We , the jury , unanimously find the defendants ... John Joseph Gotti and Frank LoCascio ... guilty on all counts . Order in the court ! Order !
zone2	counts ... you are hereby sentenced to life imprisonment ... without the possibility of parole . The sentence is to be served in federal prison ... in the state of Illinois . Makes you think . Makes you think about the people in your life ... and I think of Neil ... if he was here , what he 'd say to me . He 'd say , " John , what 's life about ... if you do n't go through it as a man 's man ? " He 'd say , " Suck it up , take the fall , do the time . That 's made you who you are . That makes you what you are . " How long we been around , this thing of ours , this Cosa Nostra ? 120 years . What 's it about ? It 's about rules . Parameters . You take the beating'for the friend . You do n't lay down . You do n't betray who you are , what you are . You got ta remember Angie , my brother Gene , Joey D'Mig
zone2	years now . They do n't rat . Why ? That 's the rule . You do n't break . You do n't rat . They want me to be something I wasn ' t even born to be . Humble . Okay , so you humble me . What you got now ? You got a war . You got global war . You got a worldwide crime syndicate now . There 's no rules . There 's no parameters . There 's no feelings . There 's no feelings for this country . So , five , ten years from now ... they gon na wish there was American Cosa Nostra . Five , ten years from now ... they 're gon na miss John Gotti .

zone2	118560 This is Unit 23 . We 're outside the [Delson] Building . We 've recovered the stolen vehicle . [Male_Narrating] Some people say I have a problem . I see a beautiful vintage car , and I just have to steal it . Like this A.C . Cobra , for instance . But to me , it 's more like a duty . We live in a world where all the right things ... somehow end up with all the wrong people . And me and Max feel obligated to correct that . That 's Max , my highly trained canine companion . And that 's me , [Luke] [Delson] . We both love old cars . And the owner of this glamor girl did n't appreciate her enough . I was doin'him a favor ! Yeah , by stealing his car . I did n't steal it , I fixed it . [Luke] , you broke into the guy 's garage . Yeah , then I retuned the supercharger and realigned his timing belt . Yeah , before driving it to Santa Barbara ... for the weekend . - Just a little test drive . - With his
zone2	act like she was married . [Luke_Narrating] My boss would love to fire me , but I keep inventing things that make him even richer , like this gizmo . He thinks it 's part of a new satellite tracking system . But this little fella 's gon na make me the greatest car thief the world has ever known . It 's not about the money . It 's about the rush . [Luke_Narrating] This is just a prototype , with a couple of extras . - [Woman_#1] Amazing ! - [Woman_#2] Typical of [Luke] , is n't it ? [Siren_Wailing] [Delson] A detective 's coming up to see me who wants you charged ... again ! Have you got any idea how much money it costs me to keep you out of_jail ? Have a guess . Go on . How much ? [Luke] Relax , all right . Take a look at this . Maybe a spell in the pen will do you some good . Get out ! - There 's a call for you , [Luke] . South of France . - Do n't touch
zone2	somewhere . [Delson] Listen to me . It 's fixed . I 'm sending you to our factory in Hamburg until I can get this mess straightened out . That 's not good . I 'm out of here . Tell Lynn I 'll take the [French] call on the mobile . [Luke] ! - Detective Raisher , sir . - Okay , [Delson] ! I 'll get back to you . - Where is he ? - Where 's who ? We both know I 'm here to arrest your son . Come on , Detective . Lighten up . This whole car thing 's ... a little misunderstanding . He stole it , like he stole the other 1 7 vintage automobiles missing in the last 8 months . Okay , maybe he 's got a problem . We 're dealing with it . That is $5 million worth of stolen property , and he 's not walking away from it . Where is he ? - Unfortunately , he left for Germany this morning . - Shit ! Yo ! I want a copy of all departure
zone2	Get [Leblanc] patched through on the radio . - Who ? - That Interpol jerk in Paris . I do n't care what it takes . This time [Delson] 's going down . Where is my car ? [Luke_Narrating] The call from France was the one I was waiting for . My chance for a place in history . And nothing was gon na get in my way . At least , that 's what I thought . - [Siren_Wailing] - What do you say about tomorrow ? What the fuck is that running on ? We 've been in for fuel twice ... and that son of a bitch just keeps going . It 's a big fucking secret . [Man] You 're looking at history , boys . The R.P.M . is n't only an investment opportunity , it 's a revolution . So it 's fast . Big deal . - What about fuel consumption ? - Keep watching . Okay , bring her in . So , you wan na get your heads from up your asses ? How many miles to the gallon in normal
zone2	fucking tires wear out . What fuel are you using ? Fuel ! I 'll tell you what fuel ! She runs on genius ! The direct brilliance of my mind ! Dr . [Grinkstein] , gentlemen . Head ... - of my research and development . - Is she not incredible ? Is she not the most astounding thing you 've ever been privileged to see ? She is . Thank you , Doctor . Now , if you 'll excuse us . Amazing . Erotic . - Passionate . Sensual ! - Shut up ! I want her under wraps and behind bars now . What 's this engine gon na cost the consumer when it 's mass-produced ? No more than your standard family car . Sure is a beautiful piece of machinery . How long is it gon na take to gear up ? When your money 's in , you 'll get your answers ! Do you realize what this will do to the world 's stock markets ? - You 'll be able to buy oil stocks for pennies . - Yeah ! More
zone2	me is going to be filthy rich . I tell a lie . Outrageously rich . [Luke_Narrating] Let 's be honest . [Biggerman] was a world-class asshole . But in a couple weeks , he was gon na be the richest asshole on the planet . And that was n't going to make the current holder of that title happy at all . What 's this , a lockup ? [Shouting] [Man] Pull ! [Luke_Narrating] Constantine [Chiarkos] , [Biggerman] 's greatest rival . And not just a lousy shot , but a cheat too . Damn ! - Pull ! - [Machine_Gun_Shots] [Laughing] - Well ? - I 'm afraid the news is n't good , sir . Interpol is stepping up their investigation into you . Stealing the R.P.M . now would make too much attention . Screw the attention ! [Biggerman] 's seeing investors . If that technology gets out and the world starts buying gas-free cars , what the fuck do I do with 67 oil tankers ? - Ahh . - I want that car , [Zantos] . And I will not let a man who
zone2	me . [Luke_Narrating] My boss 's orders were to go straight to Germany . But I preferred to follow some other orders . Orders that took me straight to sunny Nice , the [French] Riviera . - Ahh , feather-soft landing , as usual , [Luke] . - Thanks , Tim . There 's something wrong with this radar scanner . Did n't you have it checked out ? She had a complete overhaul two weeks ago . Everything checked out . It 's that fuse circuit head at the rear of the processor . A tricky thing to replace . We may have to lay over longer than planned . Mr . [Delson] was very clear . The factory in Hamburg with no delays . We 'll be there as soon as you get that fixed . Hey , what happened to the sun ? - [Karen] , guard this with your life . - Yes , sir . What is it ? It 's a circuit head to the scanner , and it 's our little secret . Might this mean a longer stopover than planned ? Regrettably
zone2	an angel , [Karen] . I want you to carry these in for me , Max . Ca n't have any trouble at customs , so listen to me for once in your life . Come on , stop flirting ' . [Luke_Narrating] Getting through customs can be a problem for a bi-continental car thief . - I know it 's gon na look silly -- - There are pieces of equipment that are hard to explain away , which is why I 've come up with a creative solution of my own . But Max does n't really like being a part of it . - [Scanner_Beeping] - That must be him . That 's a great little outfit . Oh , hi . Here I go . No stamp ? Too bad . Thank you . Thank you . Arrivederci . That 's a great color . I know , I know . I 'll get you a beer later . Woof ! [Laughs] I know , Max , I know . I did n't like it one bit either . But a man 's got ta do
zone2	in this world . [Luke_Narrating] And then I saw her , and I knew I just had to have her . How low can you go ? Hey , look , Max ! James Bond . Not many of these babies in captivity . - Think she needs rescuing . - Pile of useless goddamn junk ! [In_French_Accent] A kick to the bodywork ! No ! It never clears a blocked spark generator . I do n't know what you 're going on about , smart-ass . But you 're going the right way of getting a blockage of your own . " Classic cars , " my broker says ! [Luke_Narrating] What did I tell you ? Some people do n't recognize class . - None of them bloody work ! - I could fix this clunker for you . If I could borrow your watch . I 'll give it back . [Luke_Narrating] To others , class stands out a mile . - This car is a work of art . - This car is a pile of shit ! [Luke_Narrating] Oh , well . Appearances can sometimes
zone2	the seat . [Woman] Hello . What 's your name ? Tsh , tsh , tsh . Now , give it a try . Give try . [Engine_Revving] Okay , so it 's your lucky day . If you could just hold this wire for me . Watch the con rods . If they shake , I will iron out the revs . Max ! Max , I mean now ! We 're gon na have to have a serious talk . Get that mutt off my leather ! - Are you watching ? - Watching what ? How you say " smart-ass " ? In America we say ... sucker ! [Luke_Narrating] Nice seemed like a nice town , if you like trouble . And trouble that looked like that had my name written all over it . [Arguing_In_French] - Are these men bothering you ? - No , but you are . Do n't worry , Max . I think I can handle this . [Arguing_Continues] - Come on , break it up . - [French] [French] - That was really dumb . - I thought it was
zone2	was dumb . [Tires_Screeching] - Are you okay ? - Sure . I know , a little shaken up . But there 'll be time to thank me -- Ow ! Later . [Siren_Wailing] Damn ! - Damn ! - Pull over ! - I 'm afraid that 's not possible . - Pull over ! - Do n't tell me you stole this car . - I wo n't then . - Pull over ! - Goddamn it ! Crazy . Are you crazy or something ? I have n't done this in a long time . Keep cool , Max ! - So , what are you doing for dinner ? - What ? [Luke_Narrating] I guess some people just do n't appreciate ... you giving ' em a good turn . The next morning was [Chiarkos] 's Concours d'Elegance . One of the best vintage car shows in the world . Alfa Romeo , Bugatti , Citroen , Delahaye , Jaguar , Corvette , Aston Martin , Ferrari . The list was endless . Just being in the same town with that much beauty ... was worth
zone2	out , that was a good attitude to have , because that 's what was coming . ' trouble , in spades . The moment I saw it , I knew whoever owned this yacht must have a really small dick . But that was his problem . And I was about to find that I had plenty of my own . - Something smells bad , Max . - [Barks] Not you . [Luke_Narrating] It takes a real pro to liberate a Delage . It just had to be [Claudia] . [Claudia] Hex . Well , what do you know ? Ass end of a very bad day . It 's a pleasure to see you too . Agh ! All right , you win , [Claudia] . - You do n't win ' cause I 'm not crying . - I 'll make you cry . Mr . [Delson] ! Mr . [Chiarkos] . I should 've known . - All right , give in ? - Okay , you win . I trust you had a good trip . - What I had was a wasted trip
zone2	was a professionally run job . Obviously , I was wrong . You came here for the same reason as her . You ca n't resist them . You 're hooked , both of you . It 's like a drug . Some of the most beautiful cars in the world are here for the Concours d'Elegance , and I 'll pay you to steal them . - It 's not about the money . - Oh . It 's about the rush . I see you both made a good start . - Are you sponsoring this show ? - Mmm . Ironic , is n't it ? All those idiots who would n't sell me their cars have traveled halfway over the world ... at their own expense to hand them to me on a plate . You 'll get $25,000 advance ... against any expenses you may incur . Are you both in ? Work with her ? For you ? You 're crazy , Mr . [Chiarkos] . I do n't need your money . - And I do n't want your job . - I
zone2	. Take her up and fix her a drink . I 'm not finished with you , either . Oh , what happened to your poor little head ? [Luke] Come on ! This is bullshit ! Time is money . It was the R.P.M . I wanted to speak to you about . R.P.M . ? The gas-free engine ? Is it ready ? Test driven only , but [Biggerman] 's got investors crawling all over him . [Biggerman] . Ooh , it must be kind of irritating , dickhead like [Biggerman] getting egg all over your face . I 've got 67 fucking tankers floating out to sea full of gasoline . If that engine sees the light of day , it might as well be horseshit ! - [Snickers] - Now , if you get the R.P.M . while it 's down here , - you 'll get a modest bonus . - How modest ?

I think it 's too hot to be spending the afternoon with small-time corpses ... when we know [Delson] 's here . Small time ? These men have a big-time boss . These men work for [Chiarkos] . [Luke_Narrating] [Chiarkos] had been dumb enough to try to

I say we concentrate on [Delson] and deal with [Chiarkos] later . - I think you are obsessed by this [Delson] . - Damn right , I am . That rich punk has given me the runaround for too long . I 've got an extradition order for his ass . I 've flown 6,000 miles for this . But you are in danger of letting the tail wag the chicken .

They 're both contract operators stealing in bulk for individual clients . Just suppose that [Chiarkos] was the client . Why would [Chiarkos] want to steal these cars ? -
zone2	. Maybe he 's trying to tie the police in knots while he moves in on what he really wants . And you are going to tell me what it is , I suppose . Those men who worked for [Chiarkos] , the one's in the ditch -- According to police reports , they were last seen at [Biggerman] 's test track . [Chuckles] Now you bring in [Biggerman] . - What 's he testing down there ? - Is this all you can think about ? This case ? This endless speculation ... about the who , the why and the what ? There 's something going on . I can feel it . Maybe we should discuss it over lunch ? Would you cut it out with this " lunch " thing ? - Dinner , then ? - Oh , for chrissake !

You should 've given him a thousand , and had it done properly . Aah , holy shit ! - Damn Frogs ! - I do n't know why you 're looking under there . You do n't even know how to put gas in it . - You have a big problem I can help you with ? - I do n't know what happened . Shejust dropped dead on me . I know more about broads than cars .

A combination I detest . - So the answer 's no ? - But a " no " which suddenly makes sense . My mind has been spinning and spinning ... asking the same question over and over again . Why ? Every effort I make to reach out to you , you just ignore . You dismiss it as another unwanted sexual advance . What on earth are you talking about ?

zone2	I 've been looking all over for you . I would 've called you , but you disappeared on me . I did n't know what to do . I never did anything like that before , going home with someone I do n't know . Hey , you and me , both . It was just one of those great ... phenomenal ... spontaneous things . Yes , it was . - How long has it been ? - Three months . Do you mind if I have some of these ? My stomach is not so good . Go ahead , help yourself . Want something to drink ? I 've got water . Water 's fine . You 've done a lot with this place . Yeah , I 've been kind of busy . Wow ! You look great . Thank you . So , how you been ? Pregnant . Really ? Pregnant . Well , that 's great . Terrific . Congratulations . Thank you . It 's yours . Mine ? - We were only together one night . - That 's all
zone2	of ' em . One did n't work . But that 's its job . Its job is to work . Its entire reason for being is to work . Look ... I thought about this a lot . There 's really only one thing for me to do . Oh , thank God ! I mean , I understand . - And I respect your decision . - You do ? Yes . I have always believed in a woman 's right to choose . That 's good ! Because I choose to keep this baby . And I do n't want your money . I thought the honorable thing to do ... would be to come here and tell you in person ... that I am pregnant ... that I 'm keeping this baby ... and that it 's yours . Yeah , I 'm glad you ... I 'm feeling awfully neglected out there . It 's time we went to dinner . Tracy , could you give me a minute , please ? Sorry . I came at a bad time . I 'll go get
zone2	Tracy , what are you up for ? - I know the place . It 's a little wild . If you recommend it , I 'm sure it 's gon na be great . I 'll catch up with you guys . I 've got a bit of a family emergency . What are you doing ? Alex , do n't ! Alex is going to meet us there . Shit ! Sorry . Oh , my God . Isabel , do n't jump . - What are you doing here ? - Just stay off the ledge . I 'm not gon na kill myself , stupid . But if you come any closer , I 'll throw your ass over ! Wait a minute ! You walked out on me at 5:00 in the morning . I never heard from you . Months later you show up saying you 're pregnant . And I 'm supposed to know exactly what to do ? I 'm sorry , but I do n't know exactly what to do . That 's the best thing you 've said all night
zone2	here . My great grandfather helped build this . He came up from Aguascalientes in the ' 30s . Really ? Where ? Central Mexico . My great grandmother still lives there in a 400-year-old hacienda . Every time I drive back from there I make a wish at the state line ... right in the middle of the dam . - Does it ever work ? - Depends on the wish . My father 's gon na kill me . He does n't know ? Nobody does except Lanie , my roommate . He can be a very passionate man when it comes to his only daughter . What can I do ? - I 'll deal with it . - No , really . I wan na help . Maybe one thing . Come meet them . - Your family ? - I want them to know who you are . So later , when they ask me who the father is , I can say ... " You met him , remember ? I brought him home once . " Hey , no problem . You just
zone2	have dinner with your family once a week ? You have dinner with your family once a week ? It 's like a tradition . Why ? Do n't you ? - Holidays and stuff . - That 's it ? You do n't know my parents . That 's a lot . How are we gon na do this ? Just act like we 've been dating for a few months . Whatever you do , do n't tell them I picked you up outside a bathroom . I thought I picked you up . So we 've been dating for a couple of months . Who are you ? Let 's see . I am a camera girl at Caesar 's . You know , " Would you like a souvenir ? " That 's how I pay the bills , In real life , I 'm a photographer . I 'm doing a book about the desert . I have five brothers . The oldest one is Antonio . Then Carlos , Juan ... Miguel , Fernando , and I am the baby . But anybody messes
zone2	Tio Roberto is my favorite uncle . He 's married to Tia Rosa who makes all the tamales . She loves compliments , but you have to talk to her on her left ... because she is stone-deaf on her right ear . What else ? Oh , yeah . Never say " Jesus Christ " in front of my mother . My sister-in-law Petra and my brother Antonio have a baby named after me . - Any questions ? - Yes . What 's your last name ? Fuentes . Isabel Fuentes . And you 're Alex ... - Whitman . - Right . It 's nice to meet you . Isa , hi . I was gon na get some ice . Everyone 's around back . Who 's this ? New boyfriend ? Juan , this is Alex . Alex , this is my nosy brother Juan . - Nice to meet you . - Does Dad know about him ? And I was n't going to come tonight . Good luck ! Your father , is he a big man ? Come on . Let 's
zone2	? I guess a lot of people could n't make it . Tough room . What is the matter with everybody ? Ca n't I bring a guy to dinner ? Hello , Isa . Hi , Chuy . Fine . It 's been a long time since you came to one of these . I was afraid we 'd never be friends again . That 's where we started , is n't it ? This is Chuy . He 's a very good friend of the family . We grew up together . Chuy , hi . Luke Skywalker . How are ya ? Sorry . You probably get that a lot . Yes , he is my boyfriend . Do you have a problem with that ? It 's a pleasure to meet you . You 're a very lucky man . There 's nobody like Isa . Nobody . What happened to the music ? Seems like a nice enough guy . He 's gon na kill me , is n't he ? He 's not the one you should worry about . Come on . My
zone2	... this is Alex Whitman . Mr . Fuentes , Mrs . Fuentes , it 's a pleasure to finally meet you . Isabel talks about you all the time . That 's funny . She 's never said a word about you . Tomas , behave yourself . I ca n't keep up . She 's engaged , and then she brings home a man with a tie . I was not engaged ! Sir , that 's one of my favorite things about your daughter . She 's always full of surprises . Come on , Alex . I think we 'll be safer in the other room . Let me take your jacket . You 'll have to excuse my husband . Sometimes I think he wishes Isabel was still six years old . When you become a father , you 'll know what that means . - These pictures are really incredible . - Yes . They 're Isabel 's . Have n't you ever seen her work ? Yes . Yes , I have . It 's just that when I see her pictures ...
zone2	first time . That must be the house in Mexico . Yes . Aguascalientes . And that is Isabel 's great grandmother . They have a very special connection . You can see it in the eyes , that same wild spirit . - I can handle my own love life . - I think that runs in the family . Since when ? This is terrific ! The taste is truly amazing ! You ca n't get tamales like this in New York City ! No way ! This one 's Rosa . She 's beautiful . Would you mind holding her while I fix myself a plate ? I do n't think I should . I 'm not really qual ... I ca n't . You can . Hold her head . Why ? Does it come off ? You 'll do fine . How can so much stuff come out of something so small ? Thank you for doing this . Are you kidding ? They are great ! I had no idea that families actually talked at dinner . I 'm glad they got to meet
zone2	are n't they ? - No . I wo n't let them . Isabel , I ... Do n't . You 'll just make it worse . At least let me give you a number so you can reach me . No . It 's better this way . No complications . Please , just do n't . So , take care of yourself . Yeah , I will . You , too . What are you doing ? Get out of the way ! Do n't do this . There 's nothing to say . Just wait a minute . There might be . This afternoon I could n't decide between a Texas burger and a tuna melt . But my life made sense , you know ? And now I know exactly what I want . And my life does n't make any sense . I was doing great this afternoon . That was me . It was me then . And now I 'm with you , and I do n't know what happened . But somewhere between the tuna melt and your aunt 's tamales ...
zone2	of my dreams ... at the dry cleaners and I was too busy to notice . But then you show up , and I realize that 's not true . Because you 're the one . You are everything I never knew I always wanted . I 'm not even sure what that means , but I think ... it has something to do with the rest of my life . And I think we should get married right now . Well , well ! Look who finally decided to grace us with his presence . Sorry , Jeff . Could not be helped . Oh , no , no . You 're not getting off this easy . So ? So , who is she ? I open the door , the next thing you 're off on a date with Jessica Rabbit . Her name is Isabel , and it was n't exactly a date . Okay , that 's informative . Let me ask you a question . What the hell is dating ... except some drawn-out process of elimination ... where you both try to present
zone2	can only last about three months because eventually it leaks out . Then you spend the next three months getting to know your real selves . Then one of you wants a commitment , the other wants to bail . Then you have to start over again . Dating is stupid . Who are you , and what have you done with my best friend ? You and Karen dated , what ? Five years before you got married ? - Look what happened with you guys . - You 're using the " M " word ? There 's a woman on line one . She says she 's your wife . The only wife around here is my ex , and I am not in . Ask her if I can call her back . And get her phone number . You married her ? The one with the body ? You 're married ? Alex , does my life mean nothing to you ? It 's gon na be okay . No , it is not gon na be okay . - Who says it 's gon
zone2	And you are just pissed that I won on the first pull ... instead of putting quarters into the wrong machine for the last five years . Those were silver dollars . And that slot machine now owns my house . Alex , she says it 's urgent . It 's urgent ! The nightmare begins . I ca n't believe you did this . What were you thinking ? This is out of character for you . This makes no sense . Why would you marry her unless you knocked her up ? You knocked her up ? Yes , but that had nothing to do with it . I do n't want to burst your bubble , this being your honeymoon and all . But do you know if this baby is yours ? Have you asked for a blood test ? I ca n't do that . She 's my wife . It 's not like that . You do n't know her . Neither do you ! I welcome you in my home . This is how you repay me ? Stealing my only daughter ?
zone2	a priest ! Without her family ! Without my consent ! You are not a man . You are a thief . That 's what you are ! Jesus ! In-laws . He disowns me ? Fine . I disown him twice . We disown him , me and the baby . Let 's see how he likes that . He 's your father . You had Elvis walk you down the aisle . Can you blame the poor guy ? - How 'd your mom take it ? - I 'm a sinner . She went to church . - That bad ? - She 's lighting all the city 's candles . - Hello , my wife . - Hello , my husband . Interesting house , Alex . Did you decorate it yourself ? Yes , Lanie , I realize it is a little dull . No , you got that cozy institutional thing going on . Not after I spice it up . It 's just for the next four months . Then what ? You turn back into a frog ? No . Then we
zone2	York . We what ? We go back to ... New York . You do n't live here ? - No . I live in Manhattan . - Well , I live here . And I like it here . My family 's here , and my friends are here . And my work is here . You ca n't raise a baby in that city . People do it all the time . Have you ever been there ? There you go . And you 've never been off the strip . There 's more to Nevada than Vegas . Like what ? Like legal prostitution ? That is such a guy thing to say . If it 's any consolation , when I first got here , I hated it . But Vegas , seriously , grows on ya after a while . Ladies , let me explain something . Las Vegas is a sandbox . A sandbox for adults with too much money . New York is New York . You got culture , museums . You got the Yankees . Why does every guy from New
zone2	- How come every girl from Vegas ... - Shut up . We 're gon na let them talk . I 've been saving to do this book about the desert for five years . I finally paid off my camera equipment . My life is in Las Vegas . And my work is in New York . See ? This kind of conversation usually happens on a second date . Small , ugly thing biting me . - Che ! Che ! - Small , ugly thing biting me . Stop it ! Stop it , baby . This is Che , my dog . I mean , our dog . Welcome home . I ca n't believe this is the same house . I know . Is n't it great ? It 's their wedding present . Not everybody feels like my father . They wanted to do something special for us . - Say thank you . - Thank you . It 's very special . You do n't like it . No . I just never lived in anything so bright and ... Jesus Christ !
zone2	It 's been in my family for centuries , and it will protect us . Could n't we trade Cujo in for a Doberman ? That is n't funny . You 're hurting my baby 's feelings . What did your parents say when you told them ? I feel so stupid . I forgot they went to Europe for the summer . It 's April . They like to get there early . So you did all this in one day ? I should hire you to build the club . I do n't know that you can afford us . You are so cute . Here . I 'm gon na get my camera and take a picture of my family . What are you looking at ? - So this is where you go every day . - It opened last night . I got a lot of complaints . I think the fact ... there are no walls upset people . It 's going to be wonderful . I can tell . I wanted you to be the first guest at our best table . I
zone2	. The candles . And the wine ... I mean , the milk . And pizza . It 's perfect . Perfect would be if this was New York and that was a Gray 's Papaya Hot Dog . What 's a Gray Papaya ? Broadway and 72nd . Four blocks from my apartment . The best hot dog in the world . And if we were in Mexico , we would be eating ... albondigas . They 're this sort of meatball soup . My great grandmother is famous for them . Alex , you have to come with me one day . You 'd love it there . There are no phones , no electricity , no people . No kidding ? There 's a spot in the middle of Central Park ... the Bethesda Fountain . If you sit there long enough , the entire city walks by . And I know of this one canyon ... that if you sit there long enough , nobody finds you and you die . Really ? I could not believe it ! The whole night ... he kept changing
zone2	. What do you expect ? His life is not your life . - I thought you were on my side . - He has a family to support . He can do that here . We can do it together . Marriage is about finding a middle ground . You have to learn to pick your battles . - I sure picked one this morning . - What did you do ? Nothing ! I just had the guys drop by to take him shooting . Alex is alone with your brothers ? And Chuy . I better light another candle . Isabel said there are some pretty interesting canyons up here . One in particular where people go to die . That 's the other way , right ? What 's this about you taking Isabel to New York ? That 's just an idea . There 's nothing carved in stone . She wo n't go . I 'd bet my life on it . Shucks , Juan . Nobody here expects someone to give up his life . Do they , Chuy ? What are you
zone2	Or are you doing a Hillary and be Isabel Fuentes-Whitman ? That 's Mrs . Alex Whitman to you . Pardon me . I 'm sorry . Excuse me . Excuse me a moment . I did n't mean to eavesdrop , but I could n't help but overhear . Did you just say Alex Whitman ? From New Canaan , Connecticut ? I think that 's where he 's from . Late 20s , about six feet tall , dark hair , talks a lot with his hands ? That 's him . I 'm sorry . I 'm Cathy Stewart . Our families are very old friends . You 're kidding ? That 's fantastic ! I really do n't know any of his friends , so I am so glad to meet you . I 'm Isabel . And this is Lanie . I 've missed Alex the last trips out here . He 's always so busy . How do you know him ? I 'm his wife . I beg your pardon ? Alex and I , we 're married . And they 're gon
zone2	Congratulations . Is n't this a surprise ? This is some backyard . I can see why you like it up here . Must 've been fun growing up . You know , all these rocks ... the open space , the view ... the birds . The snakes . Do not move . Everybody , do this on three . Ready ? - Wait . - One . - What are we doing on three ? - Two . - What happens on three ? - Three ! Stop ! Stop ! I 'm coming ! Lucy , you got some explaining to do . Oh , my God ! What did you do to him ? He fell into some cactus . A lot of cactus . We gave him Tequila for the pain . The desert made a big impression on him . I told you to make it special , idiot ! Not to kill him . Get the hell out of here ! You , too . Come on . Baby ? Honey ? Whatever you do , do n't turn over . I 'm
zone2	If babies can only see in black and white , then how come ... that Barney guy is purple ? Dinosaurs come later . Do n't sit there . I 'm doing the floors next . Again ? I read about this . This is the " nesting period . " It must be because I ca n't seem to get this place clean enough . Come here . - I 'm sorry . Poor baby . - There 's one still in there . Then we 'll have to take these pants off so I can take a closer look . Whatever you say , Doctor . I forgot to tell you . I ran into an old friend of yours . - Cathy something . - Cathy Stewart ? Really ? When ? Last week , the same day as the cactus . I think she 's jealous . Really ? I 'll get it . Coming ! - Surprise ! - Mom ! Dad ! I wanted to call first . This was her idea . I spoke to Cathy . She said to get out here
zone2	! What the hell is that ? A squirrel ? - Who is it ? - I got it , hon . Now that is what I call a housekeeper . Did we come at a bad time ? She 's cleaning the oven , and the fumes are ... You 're here . You 're really here . - Hi . - Hello . Alex , are n't you going to introduce us ? Yes . Yes . This is ... - Isabel . - Isabel . Right . Right . It 's nice to meet you . I 'm Alex 's mother , Mrs . Whitman . And this is Mr . Whitman . Oh , my God ! You 're his parents . Oh , my God ! Look at me . I 'm a mess . It 's so great to finally meet you . Please , come in , come in . Very friendly . You must be exhausted . Did you just get in ? - Would you like a drink ? - That is a great idea . You get the drinks .
zone2	something . - Who wants a cold beer ? - Terrific . - I 'd love one . Do n't tell them anything until I come back . She is wonderful ! There must be a lot of good help around here , being so close to Mexico . - Such a warm people . - Is n't this a company house ? You would think they could afford a decent decorator . Dad , Mom , why do n't you sit down ? What 's this ? Is something wrong ? Yes . I have to tell ... Isabel where the bottle opener is . How was Europe ? Boy , you came back soon . Europe ? Alex said you were gone for the summer . You know better than that . We hate Europe in the summer . - Too many tourists . - Europe in the summer . You lied to me ... all this time . - What does that mean ? - It means you 're a liar and a coward . Sounded prettier in Spanish . Would you excuse me a minute ?
zone2	Isabel , I was going to tell them . - When ? - After the baby was born ? - I did n't want to do it on the phone . My father wo n't even speak to me , but I went there . I told him the truth . But you do n't have the balls to phone and let them know what 's going on . My family 's not like yours . I never see them or talk to them . Excuses ! Excuses ! Excuses ! You should have told them ! I wanted to do it in person ! Why is that hard for you to understand ? Here 's your big chance . Mom , Dad ... I have some interesting and exciting news . I 'd like you to meet Isabel Fuentes ... Whitman . Oh , my God . I let these people come , did n't I ? That does n't mean I have to like it . - Mama , do something . - Why are you being so difficult ? Because as far as I 'm concerned ...
zone2	married . And if she 's not married , she has no in-laws . So why am I celebrating the Cinco de Mayo with strangers ? They 're strangers because you wo n't talk to them . Tomas , either you act like the man I married ... or tonight you sleep with the dogs . I hope you have plenty of lotion on . The desert sun kicks off this water like a mirror . No , I think if we stay in the shade , we 'll be fine . Suit yourselves . Pity you did n't bring suits . Yes . Well , we did n't exactly plan for this . Jesus Christ , is it hot ! Se ? or , I would like to tell you something . I do not believe these kids have a clue ... what they are getting into . I could n't agree with you more . - Really ? - Absolutely . Marriage is a serious commitment . I happen to think that it 's terribly romantic . Hon , see , you 're not helping . I have
zone2	you once were chasing after us . This is different ! They are different ! They come from a different culture , a different world . It 's hard enough to make a marriage work without adding to it . Listen to the man , Alex . He has a point . I think they 're going to start spelling the big word soon . Why ca n't you be happy for us ? Because I 'm afraid for you . This whole thing never would have happened if he had n't gone after ... Now , wait just a second , Tomas . It takes two to tango . She is as guilty as he is . Let 's just calm down , shall we ? They fell in love . And love is a beautiful thing Ask yourself this question , Isabelita : Where will you live ? How will you raise your child ? - We do n't know yet . - You see ? Let 's start with the economics . They will live in New York ... because that 's where his job is .
zone2	Says who ? - The mother is Catholic . Whatever the mother is , the baby is . And what is the matter with Presbyterian ? - Presbyterian is not a religion . - I beg your pardon ? Thomas , Tomas , whatever ... this country was founded by people escaping religious persecution . The Whitmans were one of them ! When the west was stolen from Mexico ... the Fuentes family made a vow ... that even though they took our land , they 'd never take our culture ! You call this culture ? Guacamole and a ghetto blaster in the middle of a desert ? Now you 're offending Amalia 's guacamole ? What 's wrong with Amalia 's guacamole ? In case you have n't noticed ... the white people are melting out here ! It was 112 degrees . I fried an egg on my head . And he did n't mean " white . " He meant ... - He meant " not tan . " - Do n't go there . Your father was n't helpful either with all that Catholic talk
zone2	pregnant ... I got stopped at a stop light in front of St . Viviana 's . You know what it was ? It was a sign . Of what ? That the baby would be Catholic . It 's a good thing you were n't stopped in front of an IHOP . - You think that 's funny ? - Religion is the opiate of the masses . - Country clubs are full with racists . - Yes . Right . I agree . But do you think hanging a crucifix on a wall will protect you from anything ? As a matter of fact I do . I believe because I am a woman of faith . The faith I have in that crucifix and the faith I have in us ... all comes from the same place inside of me . Now you , on the other hand ... you 're not even an active Presbyterian . So why do n't you want me to carry my faith and my belief to our child ? It 's a good way to be , a good thing to
zone2	, not the only thing to do . - Where are you going ? - You 're not my favorite person now . Well , you either . Do you want my advice ? Get out now . I 'll even file it for you . Who said lawyers do n't have hearts ? What did you expect ? You have a relationship built on heat . It 's like Vegas . Why did n't they just build this city on the fuckin ' sun ? Maybe you 're not the guy to talk to about this . I 'm the perfect guy to talk to because I know what you 're trying to do . You 're trying to be decent . The longer you put this off , the worse it'll be . Put what off ? I just said we had a fight . You said more than that , my friend . Look , Alex ... we 're here to get a job done and we 're running behind schedule . Can I help it if Cinco de Mayo fell on Tuesday ? Get your priorities
zone2	? What 's up ? - We had a visit from OSHA . Will you talk to the foreman ? We came this close to a shutdown . Jesus . Jesus . I will handle this , okay ? Good . Mrs . Gonzales , please ? - May I help you ? - Isabel Fuentes-Whitman . - I thought you had to work . - I do . - But I need to talk to you . - I need to talk to you , too . I feel bad about the way things have been going . Oh , no , it was my fault . I have n't been completely honest with you . And I was thinking on the way over ... Hello , Isabel . How are we today ? We are fine . You must be the father I 've heard so much about . - I 'm Lisa Barnes . - Alex Whitman . You 're just in time for the show . You wan na watch ? Come over here . - Is that gon na hurt her ? - No ,
zone2	's your baby 's heartbeat . - It 's so fast . - It 's normal . - Neat , huh ? - Yeah . There 's the head . There 's a leg . Wait a minute . Is that his ... Actually I think that 's an arm . It 's too early to determine the baby 's sex . Okay , let 's take the first picture of your baby . I 'm sorry . Me , too . I can hear his little heartbeat . It was going ... That 's great . I spoke to New York . Guess who is three weeks ahead of schedule ? - Charlie Peters does n't have a life . - I 'm just saying . Where the hell is my crane ? The foreman says first thing tomorrow . Hello ! - Hey , Isabel . - Wow . - What are you doing here ? - I 've come to kidnap you . Alex , this is not a good day . Do n't make me hurt you , gringo . It 's his birthday , and
zone2	Will you cover for me ? - Please ? - Have a good time . - Thank you , Jeff . - Bye-bye . - Bye . - Where 're we going ? - It 's a surprise . Big surprise . The very first time I came here ... my father told me a story about a family of squirrels that lived on the plateau . He said that one day the canyon split . Half of the squirrels ended up on the north rim ... . and the other half on the south rim . Over time , the two families became different ... each adjusting to their own environment . The one's to the north are dark ... bushy-tailed and have bigger ears . The one's to the south are leaner ... meaner and much prettier . And even though they look different and act different ... they are the exact same squirrel . They just grew up on different sides . And this canyon between them ? Will they ever be able to cross it ? Well ... I 've been thinking about making you a
zone2	's born ... I 'll move to New York . Isabel , that 's great ! I 'm not saying I like it , but I 'll give it a try . Oh , you 've got a deal . Good . I 'll give you your present . There 's more ? I called my new mother-in-law and asked her to do me a little favor . This arrived today . I ca n't believe you did this ! Who said you ca n't have the best of both worlds ? This is the most wonderful birthday I 've ever had . Okay , you think this is good , wait 'll you try these . Let 's see . This is good . You 've got five men without hard hats . No load statement . The bathroom doors do n't meet handicapped standards . And I told your foreman two weeks ago to build that ramp . I 'm gon na have to shut you down . Whoa . Would you excuse us for a minute ? Stanley , walk with me . Are you gon na
zone2	, Alex . You got one week . Anything goes wrong out here , I mean anything , it 's your ass . I swear to God , if anything else goes wrong , I will red-tag this place myself . Let 's forget about this and go to lunch . What happened ? - Get over here ! - We could take my car . - It was a sign . - Of course it was . God was telling him to quit that job and stay here with you . No , Mama . It was like a real sign with neon and all that stuff . Oh . Then it was a miracle nobody got hurt . And when does your husband come home ? Tonight . He does n't sound very good . Wait . Which candle am I lighting ? To keep the job or lose the job ? To keep . I probably should 've sent you to Tokyo . Judd , I can open Vegas in three weeks . If you could pull that off ... I just might be forced to give
zone2	to me ? You 're the best field man I 've got . We break ground July 1 . Jeff said it was n't starting until October . Should I give it to somebody else ? The baby 's due in October . - I promised ... - Is there a problem ? No , there 's no problem . Alex , look what Petra and Antonio got us ? Is n't it cute ? We have clubs in New York , Dallas . We have clubs in Hawaii . We have clubs everywhere . So with your help , and your help ... I think this could be the most successful club we 've ever had . Honey , let him get the club opened . He 's changed , Lanie . I ca n't reach him . Something happened in New York . - The guy has a lot on his mind . - It 's more than that . I think he 's in trouble , but he wo n't talk to me . You think he wants out ? I do n't know . - I
zone2	. I 'm getting a drink . You should n't worry about anything . It 's your big night . I think now that the club 's open , we should talk ... I am so proud of you . This looks fantastic . Why are n't you more excited ? It 's been hectic . It 's been a lot going on . You look great . No , I look fat . Oh . Feel this . The baby likes the music . - Oh , hi ! - Hi . There 's a teeny problem in the kitchen . - Okay . I 'll see you ? - Yeah . See you . You and Jeff seem to be getting along really well . I hate talking to men who are prettier than I am .

But sometimes , On his way home from the docks , he liked to stop in with the guys , And have a couple of beers , you know . I remember comin ' home from school one day , And the whole house was dark . Could n't figure it out . I heard my mom cryin ' off in the dark someplace . I was old enough at that point ; i could reach the light switch ... And turn the lights on . And i saw ... What he did to her . So i went to my room and i got the baseball bat -- Mickey mantle model my old man gave me for Christmas -- And i found the old man passed out in the bathtub . And i tattooed him . Needless to say , when i
zone2	house was lit up like ebbetts field . The old man , uh , never drank again . So , All i 'm sayin ' to you is if you want to drink , go ahead and drink . But if i ever find out that you laid your hands on that little girl again , Me and mr . Mantle are gon na pay you a visit , my friend . - Are you done ? - Yeah , i 'm done . Good .

After that , everybody hated everybody . I was no longer allowed to see elise . But get this , i
zone2	at the time . Does that make any sense to you at all ? Life do n't make sense . It 's not fair . It does n't follow logic or obey orders . [Exhales] [Max] , you got a chance right now . Stop this from goin ' further . I know you got no reason to trust me , but ... You let me walk , i 'll see what i can do for elise . My word , you 've got it . Honestly , mr .

That one of us might be in on it . Oh , Jesus . Just calm down . It could be bullshit . It 's got ta be , right ? The fact of the matter is , he 's probably trying to throw us off guard . Fact . Wait . Wait , though . Hey , this is good . Now , just hear me out . If it is true , We could figure out who the rat is . And then - - listen . Then maybe we could score some points with [Charlie] ,
zone2	. He 'll just let us off with a-a-a ... Warning or something . What ? [Ira] , do n't even think about telling anyone until i figure this out . Hey . Hey . Buddy , it 's me , all right ? T.k .

About a year ago , [Charlie] had a house in jersey . He moves in . Next-door neighbors have dogs . Two dogs ? They 're barkin ' all night long .

You got balls , kid . I 'd hate to get stuck up there alone , especially at night . It happened to me once . When i was a kid , i started out ... Do you mind ? Taking bets , making collections for numbers . All of the five boroughs . I ran my ass off . I knew every street upside down and backwards , But i 'd never been that far uptown before . I fell asleep on a subway and missed my stop . I come out , i looked around . To me it was like ... I landed on , uh - - what [Max] said -- The dark side of the moon . Yeah . I 'm sorry .

We 've been all through this with the police . I do n't see how saying it one more time ... Is gon
zone2	with both hands . Or , maybe it happened differently . What do i know ? I 'm old . I 'm tired . I 'm a senior citizen . I think you had a little too much blood loss to the brain . Maybe . Maybe not . You know , [Max] , i understand how this could happen . I 'm not sayin ' it 's okay it happened , but in a certain light it 's not as crazy as it seems . I do n't know what the fuck you 're talkin ' about . Stay with me . See if what seems crazy do n't start to make sense . I know guys could talk the virgin mary into posing for a centerfold ... And make her think it was her idea in the first place . Let 's say you owe these kinda guys something . You ca n't pay them back . Not now . So , they wear you down . They scare you pretty bad . They make you feel there 's no way out of this mess you got yourself

You have n't moved the mercury yet . I 'm not that far off , am i ? By the time these bottom feeders finish turning dogshit into diamonds , You let yourself be talked into doing something you 'd never do in a million years . - Huh ? It could happen . - Shut up , [Charlie] ! Itdoeshappen . And it always starts with the first ... Bet or babe or snort , fix , whatever , Until it becomes easy , and after that you do n't feel nothin ' ... At all . - Right ? T.k . ? - [Max] You 're full of shit , [Charlie] . You know that ?

It was my job to keep an eye on the gamblers , but my eyes were only on [Pepper] . - Fourteen , sixteen , bust . - When I stopped paying attention so did everyone else , - House pays . - And the suckers started beating the house . Then the cheaters got wind and started flocking to us . They cruise from casino to casino , looking for weak dealers the way lions look for weak antelope . [Sneezing] Queen . I could see the dealer was n't in on it , but he was lifting his hole card way too high . Yeah
zone2	that . Now here 's this guy reading the hole card and signaling his buddy . [Coughing] Bet the farm ! # I 've never felt like this before # # Something 's got a hold on me that wo n't let go # # Believe I 'll die if I only could # # I feel so strange but it sure is good # - [Zapping] - [Gasping] # Hey , hey , yeah Oh , it must be love ## - [Zapping] - [Yelling] - [Zapping] - [Yelling] [Zapping] , YellingContinue - [Zapping] - Lord ! - [Zapping] - [Shrieking] - [Zapping] - Mommy ! - Oh ! Oh ! - [Joey] was always a hothead , but I could rely on him . - Who ? No , no , no ! Now with the drugs , he was out of control , and the place was falling apart . Then the take dropped off , and that 's the worst thing that can happen at a casino . I did what I could to turn things around ... we recycled the food , fired the dishwashers
zone2	ill . We even watered down the drinks , but that meant we had to skimp in other places . [Thud] # Happy birthday to you # Then , things really took a turn when Pop came to visit . # Happy birthday , Don Cortino # # Happy birthday to you ## - [Applause] - Congratulations ! Happy birthday ! [Don_Cortino] Ah , the cake 's beautiful , Bonifacio . Beautiful . I want to thank you all for coming today . I know that many of you have put off important murders and drug deals to be here . I 'm especially pleased to have representatives from the five families with us ... the Badalotos , the Romanis , the Marzonis , the Jeffersons ... who moved on up from the East Side to get themselves a piece of the pie . My friends , a while ago I was shot 47 times . And it really got me thinking : It 's time to pass on my power . And I want you all to know that at the time of my death , I , Don
zone2	my son , [Anthony] . - [Applause] - [Guests] Congratulations ! Just great ! [Joey] , you get Wisconsin . Ah , devil 's food . Mangia ! Enjoy ! ## [Men_Singing] - Pastiori ! - Quick-pick loser ! Wisconsin ... big , fat German women . It ai n't right . If you ask me , your being passed over is an insult . I 'm smart . I can handle anything . - I been grooming ' myself my whole life to be Don . - Maybe I can help . It 's none of your business , all right ? Do n't ever try to come between me and my family . Ooh . Anger . Maybe I 've been barking up the wrong Cortino . - [Slurping] - [Moaning] [Barking] [Barking_Continues] [Man] Thattagirl . Come get the bone . - [Man] You wan na go to the park ? - Whipping , Slapping All right , now . Roll over . Speak ! - [Barking_Continues] - [Man_Sighs] - Oh , my God . How could you ? - What are ya talkin ' about ? A
zone2	, maybe . Me , you and another woman , definitely . But [Joey] ... my brother ! [Tony] , it 's not what it looks like . It 's the Heimlich . She swallowed a big chunk of meat . - You 're banging your brains out . - You 're just guessing ! What do you take me for , some kind of idiot ? [Tony] , ti amo . The air conditioning broke . We had to cool down . - How can you deny this ? - You ca n't prove anything . [Barking] , [Whimpering] - You 're a slut . You will sleep with anybody . - That 's what sluts do . If I was particular , I would n't be a slut . [Joey] ... you 're the last person in the world I 'd expect this from . - We 're family . I would never betray you ... - Do n't lie to me ! - You guys are sleeping together ! - All right , all right ! But we never actually slept ! Oh , my G ...

They 're like family to me . - [Diane] This is that whole Sicilian thing , is n't it ? - I would never betray you . - [Don_Cortino] I always knew I could count on you . - They 're criminals ... murderers . - [Anthony] Criminals are people too , [Diane] . - Get out of my life ! [Lmitating_Bill_Clinton] I did not have sexual relations with that woman ... Miss Lewinsky ... but I am wearing her underwear . It 's done . [Sighs] [Chuckie] ?

zone2	Everybody dies , but in the Mafia ... people die more often , and never by accident . The death of my father sent shock waves through the underworld . The family was without a leader . The news reached me at a private hospital ... - that catered exclusively to English patients . - One , two , three ... My explosion , his death ... someone wanted the Cortino empire . We 're here today to lay to rest the dearly departed soul ... of Don [Vincenzo] Armani Windbreaker Cortino . The Lord is my shepherd . I shall not want . He maketh me to lie down in green pastures . He leadeth me beside the still waters . Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death ... I shall fear no evil . [Gasps] - [Wheezing] - [Whistles] Wheezes , [Gasps] The rod ... Thy rod and Thy staff ... - It 's okay , [Mama] . - [Gasps] - I 'm here now . - [Gags] I know . I know . I 'm glad to see you too .

Which one of them killed my father ? - Don Romani from the Chicago family ? - [All_Gagging] Don Badaloto from the Cleveland mob ? Don Quixote ? - Don Cornelius ? - Love , peace and soul . But it was n't until I saw [Chuckie] , my brother [Joey] 's kid , taking a payoff from the man with the missing thumb , that I realized our family 's enemy had been Don Marzoni all along . I had been embraced by the man whose lifelong vendetta had been to kill my father . And now , with my own nephew , he had succeeded . In the quicksand of organized crime , the only option is retribution . My cup runneth ohhh ! [Gags] I wondered how Pop would have handled all this , - then I thought back to the most important day of my childhood . - [Boy] Daisies , daisies ... five dozen ... for a nickel ! Daisies , daisies ! Five dozen
zone2	's my favorite florist ? Oh , hi , Jenny . This is for you . Thank you . Ah , the Cortino boy . You know , your papa never paid me what he owes . You 've done well . This belongs to me . Of course , Don Narducci . And so does this ! [Gasps] , Moans Uh ! Miracle Gro ! - Hey , kid ! - Let 's grab him ! Hey , you ... c'mere ! Run , florist , run ! Get back here ! Ooh ! Pitchfork ! Look out ! [Grunts] Papa ! Papa ! Tiny [Anthony] ... my boy ! It 's a miracle ! - [Cocks_Gun] - Stay . You surprise me , Don Narducci . They say violence is the hand puppet of the ignorant . - Do n't call me ignorant . - No ? Then answer me this : Train " A " leaves Seattle at 40 miles per hour . Train " B " leaves Houston at 50 miles per hour . Which train arrives at Sea World first ? - Papa ! Papa
zone2	1938 ... there wo n't be Sea World for another 30 years . You tried to trick me . Now I kill you all . Mine ! [Both_Grunt] Don Cortino ! [Muffled] Godfather . [Anthony_Narrating] Papa taught me the virtue of vengeance . Now was time to take control of the family business . But first I had to put my life back on track , and that meant finding [Diane] . [TV_Announcer] And although it seemed an impossible dream just a few years ago , the feeling today fluctuates between anxious anticipation ... and outright exhilaration as political and spiritual leaders ... from every country on Earth have convened at this historic site ... to witness the final signature on the document ... that will secure and guarantee world peace in perpetuity . The " Peace For All Time " treaty ... or P-FAT , as it has been dubbed by its author and champion , the President of the United States ... marks the culmination of one person 's heroic crusade ... to end strife , no matter where it may occur . The presidential limousine is arriving
zone2	One can only imagine the thoughts that must be racing through her mind ... as the world 's attention focuses on this unprecedented achievement . With the addition of my signature today , P-FAT becomes a reality . It is my most fervent hope that this be ... the moment when all mankind comes together ... when at last the world 's population can rise as one , and say ... [Anthony] ? Oh , my God ! - Step back . - Stand closely . Take the left . - [Anthony] . - It 's good to see you , [Diane] . What happened to your face ? Car exploded . What are you doing here , [Anthony] ? I 've taken over the family business . I need you . I care about you . I came here ... because I want you to marry me and come home with me . Madam President ... the treaty . But what about P-FAT , [Anthony] ? I 'm so near to fulfilling the dream that ... that we once shared . There 's someone I want you to meet
zone2	. - Would you like to say hi to her ? - Hi , President Steen . Hello . You 're a daddy . I 'm a daddy . So , what 's your name ? - [Diane] . - Like me ! I named him after his mother . I 'm a mother ? - Why did n't you tell me ? - You said you did n't want to be a part of my life . Oh ! [Anthony] , he 's the most beautiful thing I 've ever seen ! He looks just like me ! You smell good . I had cantaloupe for lunch . - You like football , huh ? - Uh-huh . Ever since Michael Irvin laid off the nose candy . Do you want to play ? - I 'd love to . - Are you my real mommy ? Uh-huh . Sniffles , Honks Go long , Mommy . [Cheering] , [Applause] ## [Bells_Tolling] [Joey] Yeah , I understand , but ... I-I do n't know if I can make it there . You sure ? You 're out of the
zone2	You got ta answer for Pop . What the hell you talkin ' about ? I had nothin ' to do with that . Fingered ' I'm . Just like you set me up that day in Vegas ... that little sexual fromage-a-trois you played with [Pepper] . You think you can fool another Cortino ? You bastarducci ! Sit down . Get him a drink . [Tony] , do n't do this to me , please . You think I 'd kill my own brother just ' cause he tried to kill me ? Today 's the day I settle all family business . - I 'm putting you on a plane to Fargo . - These are over the wing ! Now , tell me everything that happened that night . Do n't lie to me , because it insults my intelligence . [Pepper] got me together with Marzoni . He said if I helped him out , he 'd make it worth my while . - He said he 'd make me head of the family . - I 'd always take care of you . You
zone2	? I 'm the oldest , [Tony] , and I was stepped over ! - That was Pop 's idea . - Well , it was n't my idea ! - You 're a psychotic lunatic . - And I deserve respect for that ! You broke my heart , [Joey] . I do n't ever want to see you again . That 's , uh , $3.50 . ## " TheBridalMarch " Dearly beloved , we are gathered here in the sight of God ... to join this man and this woman in a state of holy matrimony . - ## [Harpsichord] - It is the most sacred of journeys , one in which the sanctity of human life ... is cherished and celebrated .

Chirps , Shrieks ## [Celtic] [Exhales] [Priest] [Anthony] and [Diane] , since it is your intention ... to enter into marriage , join your right hands and declare your consent . - [Groans] - [Thud] [Minister] [Diane] , do you take [Anthony] for your lawful husband ... to have and to hold from this day forward , for better , for worse , for richer , for poorer , in sickness and in health , till death do you part ?

zone2	Did you kill [Joey] 's son ? [Sighs] No . Oh . Okay . Whoops . [Laughs] You know what ? Think I 'm gon na get some frozen yogurt . See you a little bit later . [Tony_Narrating] So , here 's the enigma : Some would argue the Mafia 's a bad thing , that it uses its power to undermine law and order ... - to promote the lowest forms of human behavior . - Don Cortino . Of course , that 's all true , but in the end , maybe it 's worth it . - The way I see it , when the law fails us , it fails our children . - [Ring_Whistles] - Godfather . - Only the Mafia has the power to do the one deed ... to benefit all mankind .

The Extraterrestrial Vulnerability Experiment ... has one central goal : to discover a means to defend ourselves ... against the alien species should they ever return to Earth . Now , as you know , gentlemen , Eve was re-created from a frozen lab embryo . She 's a genetic duplicate of the original Sil . Now , we have deliberately shielded Eve ... from any direct contact with the male gender ... which is why , gentlemen , you 're inside there . So ... proceed . Help ! Laura ! Please ! Okay , that 's enough . Bring her up . Bingo , Dr Baker ! It worked ! Take a look at those beautiful welts . Just beautiful . What happened , Dr Baker ? Our problem in a nutshell : A toxic agent works once ... but then it becomes useless once the alien 's biology adapts . You 've gone out of your way to give this ... this lab animal
zone2	! I suggest you spend more time finding a way to 86 the damn thing . Colonel , you 're welcome to replace me anytime you like . I 'm sorry , gentlemen . Tell Dr Baker we must continue testing . Aye , aye , sir . Why do you do this to me ? I 'm sorry , Eve . I 've explained to you why we 've got to do this ... what happened with the first Sil . And why you have to be prepared . Survival of the fittest . I know . I watch this TV ... and I see all the places I 'm never gon na go ... and see all the people I 'm never gon na meet . Is that all I am to you ? A laboratory animal ? I want you to understand that the reason I took this job ... was to make sure that these experiments were done with regard for you . Just do n't forget that I 'm human too . Main gear touchdown . Shuttle ground support vehicles with flight surgeon and medical

On preliminary examination , all three of you are in remarkable health ... though , of course , I 'll continue more specific blood testing . We do have a few people here who would like a further examination . Boy , there 's enough fine booty out there to cure what ails me . You 're under quarantine , Mr Gamble . No sexual activity for at least ten days . ? And that means all of you . ? Oh , you 've got ta be kidding . No , I 'm not kidding . Back when President Kennedy began the space program ... I was just a very young assistant up on the Hill . It did n't take me long to realize that he was a visionary ... and that I shared that vision . Later on , when I became a senator ... I was determined to push our program even further into space . And so today , Jack Kennedy 's vision ... is
zone2	like to think that his spirit is embodied ... in young men like Patrick Ross . ? When Patrick was five years old ... ? What happened to Patrick ? I do n't know , but he 's missing some major butt-kissing from his own father . He has n't been feeling very well tonight . Tell you the truth , I have n't been feeling so great either . Yeah , I think what we all need is a little tender loving care . So it 's with pleasure that I introduce one of our finest young leaders , the captain of the Mars mission , and my son , Patrick Ross . I 've got ta go . Lincoln suite , upstairs . Hurry . Captain Ross , everyone 's waiting . This way , sir . Nice of you to show up . Thank you all for coming out this evening . Thank you , Father , for what I 'm sure were overly kind words . I 've been chosen on behalf of my wonderful crew ... to represent the mission to Mars ... and an
zone2	the porthole ... at the blue-white globe ... beautiful ... so fragile , so small . And I thought to myself ... how easy it would be to destroy all that God has created . I think , as we look to the future ... our greatest mission might be right here at home . It 's open . Come on in . My sister decided to join us . We share everything ... together . Parker 's going for two , and he 's in there , standing ! Pulse rate is 20 percent below human norm . What do you expect , Brea ? She 's watching baseball . Oh , God ! You are a hero . Oh , God . It 's my turn . Yes , it is . Here it comes ! Parker 's going for three ! Jeez ! Did someone hit a home run ? My God , help me ! Get off me ! Marcy ! Get him off me ! Oh , my God ! Help me , someone ! ? What the hell is going on ? ? My
zone2	happened . I try to think about it , I draw a total blank . They always make those drinks at those fund-raisers strong . That 's the way they get the wallets to open up . Billy , you tell that old son-of-a-bitch I wo n't take no for an answer . There 's something wrong with me , Dad , since I got back . Do you think a trip to Mars was rough ? You just wait till you try a senate campaign . Dad , listen to me . I 'm having ... I 'm having some kind of breakdown . Stop thinking about the master plan and help me , all right ? I 'm scared . Goddamn it ! Quit acting like a spoiled child . You 're a Ross . Behave like one . And I 'm gon na give you a piece of advice , boy . You keep your dick in your pants and your eyes on the prize . Oh , I know what you been doin ' , and frankly , I do n't give a damn . But
zone2	... piss it all away on a piece of ass . People love you , Patrick . Hell , boy , they idolize you . You 're gon na be President of the United States someday . Now , let 's take a walk through the gallery . Some of my illustrious colleagues are just dyin ' to get your autograph . Yes , sir . Yes , it 's very important that I speak with Herman Cromwell . No , he 's a patient there . Well , can I get a message to him that Dr Orinsky called from the lab at Oldham Space Center up in Maryland ? Yes , it 's very important that I speak to him . I 'm an old colleague of his . I ca n't believe this . Oh , my God ! Company , halt ! Left , left ... The substance found in Dr Orinsky 's wounds is combinant alien-human DNA . This DNA is structurally similar to Eve 's ... but it 's not a perfect match . Obviously , Eve has not left the compound ... which
zone2	there . None of our intelligence suggests that a foreign power was involved . How do we start looking for this thing ? Well , I would suggest normal investigative procedure ... to cultivate a list of possible suspects and then test their blood . Thank you , Dr Baker . We may ask you to help us track it down . Always a pleasure , gentlemen . Get Press Lennox . Ladies and gentlemen , the embassy is secure . The hostages are free . Press Lennox . Diplomatic security . Provides embassy guards ... and protects against ... kidnapping and assassination ... and also , of course , special services ... like the demonstration we witnessed here today . Excuse me , Mr Lennox . Somebody needs to see you right away . My assistant will answer any questions you might have . Thank you all very much . Ladies and gentlemen , are there any questions I can answer ? Are you equipped with night vision attack capabilities ? That was really , really great . Well ? The answer is no . Press , we got
zone2	. Come on , buddy . Your country calls . Do n't start waving the flag . I 'm in the private sector now . I 've got a business to run . Look at me , Press . You know how I got this goddamn eye . It 's a sacrifice I 'd make again in a heartbeat . But then maybe you have n't learned the meaning of sacrifice . Listen , pal . The last time I fought with that alien she-bitch ... I almost got myself killed . If the government was stupid enough to make another one ... I think they can clean up the mess by themselves . We did n't make this one . Count me out of the search party , okay ? Where is my fucking key ? A million dollars , tax free . Sure you wo n't reconsider ? Welcome to Biohazard Four . Dr Baker ! Come out here ! Oh , my God . Open the doors ! Somebody open the doors ! Get him away from there ! Somebody open the doors ! What the hell
zone2	's no men allowed in this lab . Get away ! ? Calm down , Dr Baker . ? Do you have respect for this ? ? Out now , both of you ! ? We have an emergency . Okay , we 'll take it outside . ? Damn well right we 'll take it outside . ? Do n't blow a gasket . Do n't patronize me . We 're not patronizing . We 're coming along . Close the doors . Laura , correct me if I 'm wrong . Are you involved in this crazy bullshit ? Dr Baker runs this facility . She cloned the Sil embryo . Oh . Okay , well , what should I call her ? Sil Lite ? ? Her name is Eve . ? Eve . How very biblical . We have dampened her mating instinct . We have strictly avoided the presence of testosterone in this lab . At least until now . Thank you for your help in that area . What if she gets out of there ? She 's electronically tethered to a control box
zone2	capsule explodes in her brain . You know , it 's really great to see you again ... and I was hoping we 'd meet under better circumstances ... but , I remember Laura Baker having a little bit more soul . Just who the hell do you think you are ? You 're coming into my lab , questioning my motives ! Are you two finished ? We have a national fucking emergency on our hands ! Now , you two will work together . That 's a direct order from the Pentagon . You killed one of these fucking alien things before . Do it again . You heard the man . Now the fun begins . I went over Orinsky 's phone records , and this is the last place he called . There 's a patient named Herman Cromwell . Turns out he taught Orinsky at Stanford . And what exactly is Cromwell doing here ? Well , that 's the interesting part . It 's classified top-secret information . I was doing research on a Mars meteorite . The one found in the Antarctic in
zone2	might have been life on Mars . But these fossils were n't anything organic to the planet . Oh , no . And what was the basis for that determination ? Carbon-based elements in the fossils ... exist only in the Magellanic galaxy . That 's 100 million light years away . Well , how did they get to Mars ? By my reckoning ... Mars was visited by an alien species ... approximately one billion years ago . The species was like a plague , a cancer . It turned a thriving planet with ... rivers and oceans and rudimentary plant life ... into a useless hunk of rock . When I heard they were going to send a mission to Mars ... I strongly urged the government to reconsider . On what grounds ? On grounds that alien DNA might remain on the planet ... that any human attempt to violate the planet ... would result in biological contamination . So , let me guess . They told you to shove it up your ass . They got me fired from Stanford . It seems the military had
zone2	of the future , or some crap like that . Anyway , they harassed the shit out of me . I got into a fistfight with a Pentagon general ... and broke his goddamn jaw . That 's why they stuck you in here , right ? Why do you think that Dr Orinsky called you the night that he died ? To tell me I was right . Whatever species destroyed Mars ... those poor astronauts brought down to Earth . May God have pity on our souls . I 'll tell you one thing . For General Lee ... to be eatin ' up the road this early in the mornin ' ... something 's sure got Bo and Luke all head up . I figure it 's got somethin ' to do with women . Or hunting ' . Or maybe wheels . The temperature on Mars is approximately 225 degrees below zero . If they brought the samples on board , the temperature thaw ... could have brought the DNA back to life . That DNA could have infected the astronauts . This is n't the
zone2	a lead based on the interrogation ... of a certified nutcase . We got one dead N . S . E . G . doctor ... we have a guy who warned the government not to go to Mars ... they slapped him in a loony bin ... and a seven-minute time gap during the space flight . We need to do blood analysis on Sampas , Gamble and Ross . Now , I know that there is a sexual quarantine of ten days ... on all interplanetary missions , and the Mars quarantine ends tonight . They could fuck the human race into extinction . You want to be responsible for that if we do n't start testing everybody now ? Test Patrick first . Yeah . I 've been waiting to get you alone . All the interviews , all the screaming girls ... all the hoopla ... gone . Push it out of your mind . Patrick Ross ... tonight ... you 're mine . I love you . What 's the matter ? I do n't know . We should hold off . Oh , no
zone2	Come on , Missy . I do n't feel so good . Relax . Let me do the work . There 's nobody here . Where the fuck did he go ? Let 's go find the others . I missed you up there . I missed you so much . It 's so beautiful . Not as beautiful as you are . Charmer . Take it easy , Press . You 're gon na get us killed . Trust me , Laura . I got a bad feeling in my stomach . God , I missed making love with you . Oh , my stomach ! ? Oh , my God ! ? Call someone ! Call for help ! Up here . Come on ! No , please ! Oh , God . I 'm gon na get a full crew . I 'm gon na get ' em over here right away . We got ta get to the others . Oh , this is awful . This is just awful . I 'll take her the rest of the way . Have a good evening .
zone2	tugboat . I know what you thought . But I got it all under control now . Oh , you do ? Yeah , you just slide right over there . Let me open this door . There we go . Hey , girl . ? Is that it ? ? No , honey , that 's not it . Right there . No , that 's not it . Oh , that 's it . What 's wrong ? Dennis Gamble , we 'd like you to come with us . Man , a brother just ca n't get no booty . You know what I 'm sayin ' ? This is no way to treat a national hero . This is embarrassing . What is this all about ? Look , somebody speak to me . Hey , I 'm a personal friend of Senator Judson Ross , okay ? Personal friend . I 'm gon na eat your badge for breakfast . Get your hand off my head , man . I demand an explanation . We 'll have the test results in a few minutes .
zone2	E . G . said I was fine . Sit tight , son . We 'll explain everything later . Well , it 's kind of tough to sit tight , sir . I have n't been laid in 11 months . That 's unusual for me . Take it easy , Burgess . Everybody deserves an explanation . You 're damn right . And what 's with all these guards ? What the hell is going on around here ? It 's purely a precautionary measure . We need a couple of minutes for the blood analysis , so just relax . Couple of questions . What can you tell us about the seven minutes when the Excursion lost contact ? I ca n't remember . I do n't know if I blacked out , I ca n't remember . When did you last speak to Anne Sampas ? At that fund-raiser the other night . Did she act peculiar ? She seemed fine to me . What 's this all about ? Something happen to her ? You tell me . What happened to Anne Sampas ? Tell
zone2	. I 'm sorry , Dennis . Yeah . Laura . Well , the combinant DNA in Anne 's body does n't match what I found in Orinsky 's . So , it 's either Gamble or Ross . Be careful , Press . What was the cause of death ? We do n't know . Come on . How the hell did she die ? Sequence almost complete . ? Why are you testing my blood ? ? Ten seconds till relay . ? You think I killed Annie ? ? Data retrieval on-line . ? Is that what you think ? ? Five seconds . Three seconds . I did n't kill her ! I swear ! Computer says normal . There is no sign of infection . ? Go home , get some rest . ? Look , I want answers ! In due time . We 'll be in touch . Yo , Gamble . You know where Patrick Ross is ? Nope . Well , if you see him , you 'll let me know , yeah ? Sure . Well , let 's see
zone2	'll just reach behind her ear , and we should ... God . Patrick , no ! Want a date , mister ? I was scared , man . This is crazy . His whole head just grew right back like some sort of damn freak show . The alien species can regenerate living tissue . Aliens , little green men . I still ca n't believe it . If they knew there were aliens up there , why did they send us ? N . S . E . G . got warned but they chose to ignore it . We think that there was some hostile DNA in the soil samples that you collected . Something happened up there . I ca n't remember exactly . I just know it was terrible . I 'm sure that it was terrible . The question is : How do we proceed now ? I got guys out there all over the place looking for this kid . Any place he might be . We 're gon na find him sooner or later . If he 's reproducing , we 've
zone2	assume he 's banging cocktail waitresses two at a time . Well , then in less than two weeks , these offspring reach adolescence ... and then they enter the chrysalis stage . Chrysalis stage ? A cocoon which turns them into adults . Hey , baby , turn that car around . Hey , do n't leave me . Come on . Hi , honey . Baby , come back . A serial killer may be loose in the Washington-Maryland area . Authorities have asked the public to be extremely cautious ... when approached by strangers . How much for number three ? Twenty an hour . Thank you , Linda . And now for the financial news . Twenty , forty , sixty . Thank you much . Enjoy yourself . Come in . See what I mean , Laura ? Every so often , her rates go berserk . Fifty agents we got out there looking for this guy . We got nothing . Man , how can you just touch that ? Occupational hazard . So , you did n't see nothing , did n't hear
zone2	they go . You know what I mean ? They come and they go . Oh , that 's hysterical . Sit your ass down . They come , they go . You get it ? Oh , yeah , I get it . Here you go . Thanks . We 're wasting time . It 's been two days , and Lennox has n't made any headway . Maybe that 's because you gentlemen wo n't allow us to go public . Dr Baker , you said that Eve has telepathic abilities . Some . Can we send her after Patrick ? It 'd be foolish to take her out of a controlled atmosphere . There 's the danger of escape . Then we 'd have two aliens loose , instead of one . If these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring ... would be unstoppable . Well , can she tell us where he is without leaving the lab ? We 've seen spiking in her biorhythms ... which indicate a rudimentary connection ... but half her alien genes are dormant . Tracking
zone2	. Is there any way that we can wake them up ? We could use the lab 's cyclotron ... to bombard her with radiation that would awaken her dormant genes . But there is a problem . What 's that ? We make her more alien . We increase her strength , her anger . Her mating drive would go through the roof . It 's worth the risk . We 'll tighten security . She is not a lab animal . She is half-human . Please , Baker , spare us the alien rights agenda . Put her in the cyclotron . And what if I refuse ? That 's your prerogative . She 's gon na go in anyway . Gentlemen . Do n't worry , Laura . I know what they want . I 'm sorry . This is not what I intended . It 's gon na be very painful for you . I want to help . I 'm going to radiate for 45 seconds then shut it down . I 'm connected , Laura . I see what he sees . He 's
zone2	... a man walking a small dog . They 're stopping at a stoplight . Okay , here we go ! I see street signs . Gwynn 's Falls and Warwick ! ? Intersection of Gwynn 's Falls ... ? He 's in a parking lot ! ? What ? ? Gwynn 's Falls and Warwick . Gwynn 's Falls ? Where ? That 's in Reservoir Hill ! There 's a big supermarket ! He 's going into the supermarket near Gwynn 's Falls and Warwick . Hang on to your shorts ! ? He 's going after a woman ! ? Let 's go ! How the hell did you get a drivers ' license ? Where is he ? Aisle one . Fruits and vegetables ! He 's in aisle one , fruits and vegetables . We 're there . Now what ? Come on , Press ! My God ! It 's you ! ? Will you sign my Space Flakes box ? ? Sure . You got a pen ? I do . What 's your name ? Darlene . " Darlene . " You
zone2	shit . ? Which row ? ? Cereal ! Come on , Press . Watch it ! Where 's the goddamn cereal ? Nice to meet you . Really nice to meet you . It 's her ! Help me ! Which way ? Quick ! Which way ? What she say ? They 're going down some stairs . A basement ! Find a basement ! It 's dark . He wants to mate with her ! Get away ! Get up ! Shut up ! Help ! Get down ! ? Damn it ! ? No ! Help ! He 's trying to rape her ! Man , do n't shoot ! Why do n't you get a motel ? Fuckin ' kids . He knows I 'm tapping in . Help ! Leave me alone ! Stop ! Get off me ! Eve ... Patrick ! Go on ! Get out of here ! Get out ! ? Do n't move , spaceman . ? Put down the gun . Get your hands up ! Get ' em up ! What is this ? You ca n't
zone2	kind of stuff ? You told me yourself you were feeling weird . You got ta go in for tests , bro . Sure . I do n't mind going into the lab . Open the gate . What 's going on ? Estrogen level 's peaking . It 's like she 's in heat . Let me out ! Let me out ! Let 's go . Has she been given any medication ? Yes , her usual dose . Let me out , Laura ! I 'm going to double it . Let me out ! Listen to me , Laura ... Laura ! Code 459 alert . Patrick Ross in Biohazard Four . Seal the compound ! Get out of there , Sherry ! Patrick , leave her alone ! Open the door . I know what you 're going through , and I can help you . ? Let me help you . ? Open the goddamn door . I ca n't do that . I 'm sorry . ? Open it ! ? I ca n't ... Get away from her now ! The proof
zone2	capsule . I 'm sorry , Senator . Jesus God . Rest assured we 'll deal with this quietly . Medical treatment , the best doctors . The last thing this country needs is a spectacle with a national hero being publicly compromised . Cut the crap , Carter . What the hell are we gon na do ? Two imperatives : We have to find Patrick and bring him in immediately . We have to neutralize any possibility that this could leak to the media . The generals are very concerned . They 're gon na kill him , are n't they ? We need to find your son . You listen to me , you arrogant son-of-a-bitch . If you touch a hair on his head ... you will rue the day you were born ! You make it very hard to help you , Senator . Go fuck yourself ! What the hell did you think I 'd do ? Stand here and let you take my son ? I 'll call the goddamn President if I have to . Listen carefully , old man . This
zone2	wan na save Patrick ? Help us bring him in . Damn , man ! What is up ? I ca n't even get no play from an alien . Some people carry a disease in their genetic code . The possibility exists it might be passed on to their children . Those N . S . E . G . doctors told me I had sickle trait . It 's in your chart . You do n't have sickle-cell anemia , which is why you were able to go to Mars . But you 're a carrier . Right . Well , I guess that 's why he did n't get infected up on the ship . Right . Alien DNA can not cope with human genetic flaws . It has no defense against our diseases , and that might be our answer . What could be the answer ? Alien DNA infected us . It 's about time we infected them . What ? Patrick ... Dad , what are you doing here ? I kind of figured you 'd show up here . You always used to
zone2	mother . I never could convince her to get rid of it . Yeah , I used to come here when I was courting her . ? And after she died ... ? What do you want ? Well ... First off , I 'd like to apologize . Apologize for what ? Oh , Paddy . Do n't bother . They told me what happened ... how you got infected up on Mars . I 'm sorry , Paddy ... for not listening when you asked for help . You never listened . I 'm listening now . They 're gon na kill me . Not if I can help it . Now , there 's no way that they can find you here . This property 's still listed under you mother 's maiden name . And I sure as hell am not gon na hand you over to those Pentagon bastards . No , sir . I 'm taking you in to Johns Hopkins ... for treatment with the best . We 'll walk through that door together . Come in with me , son . No
zone2	. But try to think of your mother . Do it for her . Dad , help me . It 's okay . It 's okay . Eve ... We need your help again to find Patrick . I 'm sorry , Laura . I ca n't do that . We could just call in the National Guard . Sorry , pal . This is strictly a private mission . Yeah , well , I 'm a lover . I 'm not a fighter . You have n't been one of those in 11 months . Why you got ta bring that up ? Okay , I was a lover . I sure as hell ai n't no damned bounty hunter . This looks about right . What ? That little , old tiny ass thing ? You ai n't got no bazookas up in here ? Bazookas ? Has n't anyone ever told you that size does n't matter ? I mean , you can talk all that noise if you want to . I 'm taking this because I 'm about to go back to Africa on somebody
zone2	as the basis for this toxin . Of course , I have no idea whether or not this is going to work . It 's an interesting idea . It might be the only chance we got . But what if it does n't work ? Well , then , my friend , we 're fucked . Get the tether ! Containment breach . We 're locked in here ! Electronic tether , armed for activation in five , four ... three , two , one . It 's stuck . Get back ! Security breach , code red , level four . Colonel , there 's a lot of activity below . Keep your distance . Let 's see what 's going on . Fire ! Come on . Get in the humvees ! Let 's go ! Now ! You heard him ! Go ! How in the hell does she know how to drive ? Her favorite show 's The Dukes of Hazard . Fan-fuckin ' - tastic . Burgess , this is General Metzger . Maintain your pursuit but do not engage alien escapee . Let

Welcome to the maternity ward ... from hell . Patrick 's offspring . I 'm gon na go up and see if I can find Adam and Eve . Press , this is n't Eve 's fault . She 's human too . Like them . What 's wrong ? My DNA ai n't good enough ? You let me live on that ship so I can die in this goddamn barn ? Fuck you ! Fuck all you pig motherfuckers ! I 'm about to get straight Kunta Kinte on your ass ! Dennis ! It 's working ! Score one for human DNA , baby ! Why do n't you get those ? I 'm going up here . Just do your thing , baby . Die ! Thank you . You 're welcome . Eve , get out of the way ! What the hell is going on

When did you start smoking ? Just now . I wonder if I should have this stuff analyzed . Yeah , maybe you should . You might turn into a sexual predator . ? Yeah , I guess that 's possible . ? It 'd be okay with me . I have a drag ? ? All right , one , two , three . ? Up ! ? Easy . ? Got it . Oh , now y'all show up ... after we do all the work . I wan na talk to the general . Know what I 'm saying ? Mr Gamble , I need you to lie back for me . ? Yes , I 'll be glad to . ? Nice and easy . Looks like you 're gon na be all right . I 'm fine ,

zone2	5737999 AnIdealHusband ( 1999 ) , BRMKVH264AC3 [5.1] ( Miramax , Eng ) 1280x696 - 24 FPS The morning paper , m'Lord . Ah Sir Robert Chiltern a rising star in Parliament ... tonight hosts a party that promises to be the highlight of the social calendar ... Er , with his wife Lady Gertrude ... who is herself a leading figure in women 's politics . Together ... this couple represents what is best in the English public life ... and is a noble contrast to the lax morality ... Er , so common amongst foreign politicians . Dear oh dear ... they will never say that about me , will they I sincerely hope not , sir . Bit of a busy day today , I 'm afraid . Distressingly little time for sloth or idleness . Sorry to hear it , sir . Well , not entirely your fault , Phipps . Not this time . Thank you , m'Lord . Good morning , to Tommy . Morning , Lady Chilterm . I very much look forward to this evening . Miss Mabel ... Tommy . I hope you 'll be able to make our usual appointment
zone2	to you . Good day , ladies . When Tommy wants to be romantic he talks to one just like a doctor . Till tonight . Miss Mabel . Lord Goring . Lord Goring ! Countess-good morning . Are n't you going to congratulate me , Lord Goring ? Congratulations . Are n't you going to ask what for ? I have made a great decision . I 've decided to get married . My God ! Who to ? That part-is still to be decided . Good morning , dear To Gertrude . Good morning , Lady Markby . Allow me to introduce my friend , Mrs . Cheveley . Two such charming women should know each other . How do you do ? I think Mrs . Cheveley and I have met before . of course . Gertrude . And to think you married Sir Robert Chiltern . Do you know , I was so hoping to meet your clever husband . Really ? Yes . But I have to return to Vienna on Friday . Oh dear , what a shame . Well , perhaps I might
zone2	. What can I say ? I 'd be delighted . Well we 'll see you tonight . See you tonight . You see , Phipps , fashion is what one wears oneself . What is unfashionable ... is what other people wear . Yes , my Lord . Other people are quite dreadful . The only possible society is oneself . Er , yes , my Lord . To love oneself ... is the beginning of a lifelong romance . Yes , my Lord . Their Graces , the Duke and Duchess of Berwick . Lord Windermere . Countess Basildon . ... and it is widely agreed , the last truly decent man in London ... such ... and that you 're a very personable man possessed of a most attractive personality ... and that you have brought into British politics an honesty , an integrity ... a finer , a ... a nobler atmosphere a finer attitude and higher ideals ... higher ideals . Well , one must n't believe everything one reads in the newspapers . Yes , in the old days we had the rack .
zone2	the notable exception , of course , Sir Edward ... where truth shines out like a beacon ... and lies run vainly for the shadows . Bravo , Lady Chiltern . But may I ask , do I detect in your conversation a lyricism ... not entirely uncommon in your husband 's excellent speeches ? If you are suggesting Sir Edward ... that my position in society owes anything to my wife , you are utterly mistaken . It owes everything to my wife . I demand that you make it known immediately without her , it 's true , I am entirely unexceptional . Without her love ... I 'm nothing . Anyway , all I know is , Chiltern , a serious shake-up in the Government looks inevitable now ... and I have to tell you the Prime Minster himself was asking about you this morning . Really ? Probably afraid you 'd be taking his job . Lady Markby . Mrs . Cheveley . Oh , my dear if I had a jewel for every staring eye ... I 'm glad to say , Lady Markby ,
zone2	Madame quelle surprise ! Lady Markby . I have not seen you since Berlin . Not since Berlin , Vicomte , five years ago . And you are younger and more beautiful than ever . How do you manage it ? By making it a rule only to talk to charming people like yourself . Mrs . Cheveley . What do we know about her ? Very influential in Vienna In the highest circles . A force to be reckoned with . And are you staying in London long ? That depends partly on the weather ... partly on the cooking ... and partly on your brother . My dear ... Sir Robert has been dying to meet you . Everyone is dying to meet the brilliant Mrs . Cheveley . Our Attaches in Vienna write to us about nothing else . Thank you , Sir Robert . An acquaintance that begins with a compliment is sure to develop into a real friendship . I see you 've met my sister . Yes indeed . My dear child allow me to introduce you to the Vicomte De Nanjac . You
zone2	very happy here . I am sure . I would so love to look around . Allow me . Thank you . Lord Goring . Good evening , Lady Rosebury . Good evening , young lady . Well , sir , what are you doing here ? Wasting your life as usual . You should be in bed , sir . You keep too late hours . I heard of you the other night at Lady Rufford 's dancing till four o'clock . Er , good evening , father . Ca n't make out how you stand London society . Lot of damn nobodies talking about nothing . I love talking about nothing , father . It 's the only thing I know anything about . That is a paradox , sir . I hate paradoxes . So do I , father . Everyone one meets is a paradox nowadays . Makes society so ... obvious , hmm ? Do you always understand what you say , sir ? Yes . If I listen attentively . Oh , conceited young puppy ! And I have it on very good authority
zone2	, really whose ? Baron Arnheim . Did you know the Baron well ? Intimately . Did you ? At one time . Wonderful man , was n't he ? He was very remarkable in many ways . I often think it a pity he never wrote his memoirs . They would have been interesting . Allow me to introduce my dearest friend . The idlest man in London . Good evening , Lord Goring . You 've met ? I did not think you 'd remember me , Mrs . Er Cheveley . My memory is under admirable control . Sir Robert , the Indian Ambassador . Excuse me ! And so , my dear Arthur ... are you not just a little bit pleased to see me ? Oh , my dear woman ... possibly even less than that . should you wish to avoid me entirely ... it is well to know that I 'll be staying at Claridges Hotel until Friday when I shall return to Vienna . Are you still a bachelor ? Resolutely so . Lord Goring is the result of Boodle 's Club
zone2	the institution . Thank you . And now , Sir Robert , I have something to say to you . You 'll find me an eager audience . I 'm so glad . I want to talk to you about a great political and financial scheme ... about this Argentine Company , in fact . What a tedious , practical subject to talk about , Mrs . Cheveley . Oh , I like tedious , practical subjects . What I do n't like are practical people . Besides , you 're interested . I know , in international canal schemes . Yes . But the Suez Canal was a very great and splendid undertaking . It gave us our direct route into India . This Argentine scheme is a commonplace Stock Exchange swindle . It is a speculation , Sir Robert , a brilliant , daring speculation . Believe me , Mrs . Cheveley , it is a swindle . Let us call things by their proper names . It makes matters simpler . I hope you 've not invested in it . I 'm sure you 're far too
zone2	largely in it . Who could have advised you to do such a foolish thing ? Your old friend and mine . Who ? Baron Arnheim . It was one of the last things he said . The future of the canal depends , of course , on the attitude of Her Majesty 's Government . And ... I will personally be presenting my report ... to the House of Commons on Thursday night . I can tell you now that I will be condemning the scheme in no uncertain terms . That you must not do . In your own interests , to say nothing of mine ... you must not do that . Mr . dear Mrs . Cheveley what do you mean ? Sir Robert , I will be quite frank with you . I want you to amend that report to state that the canal will be of international value . Will you do that for me ? You can not be serious . I am quite serious ... and if you do what I ask I will pay you very handsomely . Pay me ?
zone2	the world and you have you price , I suppose . Everybody has nowadays . If you will allow me , I will call your carriage for you . You have lived so long abroad , Mrs . Cheveley ... that you seem to be unable to realise that you 're talking to an English gentleman . I realize that I 'm talking to a man ... whose past is perhaps less perfect than his reputation would suggest . What are you saying ? I am saying that I know the real origin of your wealth and your career and I have got your letter too . You are very late . Did you miss me ? Awfully . Then I am sorry I did not stay away later . I like being missed . How very selfish of you . I am very selfish . Lord Goring , you are always telling me about your bad qualities . And I have n't told you the half of them as yet . Miss Mabel . Really ? Are the others very bad ? Quite dreadful . When I think of
zone2	. Well ... I must tell you that I like your qualities and I would n't have you part with one . This shows your admirable good taste . Miss Mabel . May I have the pleasure of escorting you to the music room ? Why , Tommy , I 'd be delighted . As indeed would I . Are you coming to the music room ? Um , not if there is any music going on , Miss Mabel . Well the music is in German ... so you would not understand it . Quite so , quite so . Arthur ! Gertrude , good evening . Did n't think you liked political parties . I adore political parties . They 're the place left where people do n't talk politics . The affair to which you allude was no more than a speculation . It was a swindle , Sir Robert . " Let 's call things by their proper names . It makes matters simpler . " And now I 'm going to sell you that letter back ... and the price I ask for it is
zone2	not do what you ask me . You are standing on the edge of a precipice , Sir Robert . Supposing you refuse ? What then ? Suppose I were to pay a visit to a newspaper office and give them this scandal ... and the proof of it . Think of their loathsome joy . Think of the delight they would have in tearing you down . Think ... Sir Edward . My dear Mrs . Cheveley . I do hope we have the opportunity to meet up while you 're in London . I so enjoy the cut and thrust of continental politics . I shall make it a particular priority . Sir Robert . It is infamous what you propose . Infamous . Oh no ... it is the game of life , Sir Robert as we all have to play it ... sooner of later . What a charming house , Lady Chiltern . I have spent a delightful evening . I 'm so glad . And so glad , too , you had a chance to meet my husband , Mrs . Cheveley . Though
zone2	matter of your conversation . Your carriage is waiting , Mrs . Cheveley . Thanks . Well , another time perhaps , Lady Chiltern , Good evening . Good evening , Mrs . Cheveley . Will you see me out , Sir Robert ? Now that we have the same interests at heart , we will be great friends , I hope . Certainly . You must let me have more time to consider your proposal . There is nothing to consider . Support the scheme and I will return the letter . Scandals used to lend charm , or at least interest , to a man ... nowadays they crush him . And yours is a very nasty scandal , Sir Robert . You would be hounded out of public life . You would disappear completely . My God ! What brought you into my life ? Circumstances . At some point we all have to pay for what we do . You have to pay now . I will give you any sum of money you want . Even you 're not rich enough to buy back your
zone2	the fact is , father this is not my day for talking seriously . I am very sorry but it is not my day . What do you mean , sir ? I mean that during the season , father ... I only talk seriously on the first Tuesday in every month . Between noon and three . Well make it Tuesday , sir . Make it Tuesday . Ah , yes , but it 's before noon , father ... and that 's what I 'm trying to say . I 'm very sorry but my doctor said specifically . You are thirty-six ... Father ! I only admit to thirty-two . You are thirty-six ... and you must get a wife . Wife ? A shade lack luster this morning , Chiltern . Mind on other matters I should n't wonder . I had that Cheveley woman drive by the office last night . Really ? Yes . Wanted me to write a piece about this Argentine thing . Quite interesting really . Mentioned you . Did she ? She did indeed . So what did she say
zone2	of thing . Would n't be surprised if she had shares in it . What did she say about me ? About your speech on it . Said I should be prepared for a surprise . Would n't say what . Can I take it you 've changed your position ? I wonder what kind of a woman she is . Who ? That woman , Mrs . Cheveley . Hmm , smallish . So the question remains , where to from there , hmm ? To the Hartlocks then the Basildons . ... or should we go straight to the Bachelor 's Ball ? You know , Arthur , I almost wish I were you sometimes . Hmm , do you know , Robert , I almost wish you were too . Except that you 'd probably make something useful out of my life and would never do . You could always get married . It 's the " always " bit that alarms me . ... and I could see by the glare in his eye that he was about to do it again ! Poor Mr .
zone2	is . He proposed to me in broad daylight in front of that dreadful statue of Achilles . oh really , the things that go on in front of that work of art are quite appalling . The police should interfere . I know it may not suit a modern girl like you , Mabel , but there is , of course , one ... effective way to put a stop to his proposals . And what would that be ? To accept one of them . Oh no ! Ladies ! By the way have you been talking to my father ? Why ? Should I ? Certainly not . He was foolish enough to suggest that I model myself on you . I 've always said that your father was a man of exquisite taste and rare judgment . Hard work , probity and a good woman . He neglected to mention that you took the last good woman I know . Took her right out of my arms , if I remember correctly . Which you don't . what 's that saying about the sea and there
zone2	, but I could n't possibly marry a fish . I 'd be sure to land an old trout . I never change except in my affection . What a noble nature you have , Gwendolen ! Well then the question had better be cleared up at once . But you told me yesterday . I have reason to believe that the information I received was ... prejudiced . Or any rate , misinformed . But I ... I now believe that there may be some benefit to the scheme after all . Benefit ? To whom ? This has nothing to do with Mrs . Cheveley , does it ? You seem to be displaying signs of triviality . On the contrary , Aunt Augusta ... I 've now realized for the first time in my life ... the vital importance of being earnest . Robert ... You are telling me the whole truth ? Why do ask me such a question ? Why do you not answer it ? Author ! Ladies and gentlemen ... I have enjoyed this evening immensely . Robert , is there , in
zone2	indiscretion ? ... which persuades me ... that you think as highly of the play as I so myself . You must tell me , you must , you must tell me at once . Oh , Gertrude , there is nothing in my past life that you might not know . I was sure of it , my darling . I was sure of it . You know , I found it a perfectly charming evening . Of course I did . And yours was a perfectly charming performance . The costumes were , of course , delightful , but for me ... it was the acting . Would you excuse me a moment ? Miss Mabel ? Good evening , Lord Goring . Should n't you be in bed , Miss Mabel ? Lord Goring ! My father always tells me to go to bed , so I do n't see why I should n't give you the same advice . I always pass on good advice . It 's the only sensible thing to do with it . Well , it 's very kind of you to
zone2	Mabel . But I feel I should report ... that the role of elder brother is for the moment , being more than adequately performed by my elder brother . Oh , really ? Yes , Charming and delightful performance it is too . I really think you ought to go to bed straight away , Miss Mabel . Lord Goring you 're ordering me around . I think it 's most courageous of you . ' Specially as I 'm not going to bed for hours . Darling , you will write wo n't you to Mrs . Cheveley ? And tell her that you can not support this scheme of hers . I might see her . Perhaps that would be better . Oh no , Robert , you must never see her again . Darling , I know this woman . We were at school together . I did n't trust her then and I do n't trust her now . And she must know at once that she has been mistaken in you . Now all your life you have stood apart from others . To
zone2	an ideal . Always . Be that ideal still . Claridges Hotel . No answer . Sir . I love you , Robert . Oh , love me . Love me , Gertrude . Love me always . Madam . So , what is it that brings you back to London after all these years ? Business or pleasure ? As it happens I have some business with your friend , Sir Robert Chiltern ... which , is of course , a great pleasure . And what is it that brings you here tonight ? I came because you asked me to . And because you were curious ? I suppose . Why did you ask me ? Because I was curious also to see whether you 'd come . And you did . I see you are quite as willful as you used to be . Far more . I 've greatly improved . I 've had more experience . Too much experience can be a very dangerous thing , Mrs . Cheveley . Why do n't you call me Laura ? I do n't like the name .
zone2	why . To think , it was so nearly Laura Goring . It has a certain ring , do n't you agree ? We were quite well suited I remember . Well , you were poor , I was rich . It must have suited you very well . Until you met the Baron , of course ... who was richer and that suited you much better . Have you forgiven me yet ? My dear woman ... it 's been so long now that I 'd all but forgotten you . Is n't that Goring ? It is . I 'm afraid I really must go I have an extremely pressing engagement . Really ? Well as you know ... I hate to stand between a man and his affairs . Come on , Bunbury , for goodness sake . I ca n't believe it . You are a deserter , sir . I did n't say I was getting married ... I was merely debating the virtues of the marital state . Lord Goring , there 's a gentleman to see you , sir . Short debate ,
zone2	. At all costs we must stick together . If you 'd excuse me , gentlemen ? Play the next hand without me . And now I think it 's time you knew the truth ... that all these riches this wondrous luxury ... amounts finally to nothing . And that power power over other men ... is the one and only thing worth having . Now this one I call the ' Philosophy of Power ' . ' Gospel of Gold ' . So now the question arises ... how do you become powerful . I mean you personally powerful . Cigar ? Yes , thank you . The answer is simple . The answer ... is information . Information is the modern commodity ... that can shake the world . And I happen to know ... it 's well within your grasp . And you believed what he said ? Certainly . I believed it then and I believe it now . You 've never been poor . You 've never known what ambition is . Go on . Well , by now Lord Radley was a Cabinet
zone2	was working as his personal secretary . And one night , as usual I was the last to leave the office . Later that evening ... I wrote the Baron a letter containing highly confidential information . And highly valuable information regarding the financing of the Suez Canal . A Cabinet . Secret ? Indeed . In a subsequent transaction the Baron made for himself three quarters of a million pounds . And you ? I received from the Baron one hundred and ten thousand pounds . You were worth more , Robert . No . No . No . I got exactly what I wanted I entered straight into Parliament and I 've ... well I 've never looked back . Is it fair , Arthur , that some act of youthful folly ... should be brought up against me now all these years later ? Is it fair ? Robert , life is never fair And Perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that it 's not . Now , what does Gertrude make of all this ? Robert ? My dear Robert ... secrets
zone2	life . But no man should have a secret from his own wife . She invariably finds it out . If I were to tell her , Arthur , I would lose the love of the one woman in the world I worship . I could n't tell her , but it did strike me that perhaps you might . Go on . Well , perhaps you might talk with her . Oh really . Not to tell her , of course ... but just to talk with her . I see . It 's just that Gertrude can sometimes be a little hard-headed . And you are her oldest and perhaps closest friend and I , and I just thought ... talking with you might perhaps ... soften her head a little ? Well , it has been known . Thank you , Lady Chiltern , that was most inspiring . Oh , I 'm so glad . Well I must say , Arthur ... I 'm delighted to find you showing such a keen interest in women 's politics . Oh yes , very keen . I 'm
zone2	last night . So I gather . I 'm so glad to see you . Are you ? Yes . I wanted to talk to you about Robert . Really ? He seems a little ... distracted of late . A little anxious . Yes . You 've noticed it too ? I suppose , Er yes . In a way . I mean the life that he 's chosen for himself by its own nature ... must hold innumerable stresses ... full of countless compromises . Compromises ? Well , yes . What I mean is once a man has set his heart and soul on getting to a certain point ... if he has to climb the crag , he has to climb the crag . And if he has to walk in the mire ... Well ? Well then he has to walk , my dear Gertrude , in the mire . Of course I 'm only talking in the most general terms and on a subject about which I know absolutely nothing . I always thought those were your favourite subjects , Arthur . Yes ,
zone2	, hmm ... No but supposing , for instance , a public figure , any public figure ... Er , Lord Merton or my father or Robert even say ... had , years ago , written some foolish letter to someone ... what do you mean by a foolish letter ' ? well , I mean a letter gravely compromising one 's position . I 'm putting an imaginary case , of course . I can not help but feel , Arthur , that you are wanting to tell me something . What I really want to say , dear Gertrude , is ... that if for any reason you are ever in trouble ... come to me at once and know that I will help you in every way I can . Lord Goring ... you are talking quite seriously . Well , you must forgive me , Lady Chiltern . It wo n't occur again . No , I like you to be serious . Gertrude ? Please do n't say such dreadful things to Lord Goring . Seriousness would be very unbecoming to him . Good morning
zone2	can . Oh I should like to , but I 'm afraid I 'm a little out of practice this morning . Besides , I really ought to be going . Oh , will you be there tonight ? Well , I 've received no invitation . Well , you have now . I 'm sorry , Mabel , I 'm not in the mood for modern art . You do n't mind , do you , if Arthur escorts you in my place ? As long as he promises not to be serious . For I have observed a worrying trend . I swear on my life to be utterly trivial and never to keep my word . In which case I shall be delighted . In which case so shall I . My dear , Gertrude thank you . You will remember what I said to you , wo n't you ? Yes . But I still do n't know why you said it . I hardly know myself . Goodbye . Miss Mabel . Lord Goring ? Lord Goring ? What dreadful manners you have , leaving
zone2	very badly brought up . Hmm , I was . I wish I had brought you up . I 'm sorry you did n't . It is too late now , I suppose ? I should n't think so for a moment . So ... So ... Till tonight then . Eight o'clock . Eight o'clock . So ... So ... My dear Sir Robert ... I must confess to being not disappointed to receive your letter of last night ... and to learn that my proposition held no interest for you . perhaps I failed to present it in sufficiently attractive or persuasive terms . Another time perhaps Yours sincerely ... Laura Cheveley . Ps . If I should be in the neighbourhood ... I might just pay my respects to your charming wife . I wonder whether the matter would be of any interest to her ? Mrs . Cheveley ? Wo n't you sit down ? Thanks . And you know ... I ca n't help feeling that this disturbing new thing , this ... ' Higher Education of Women ' will deal a terrible blow to
zone2	what I should like to see . Men need it so sadly . They do , dear . But I 'm afraid such a scheme would be quite unpractical . I do n't think man has much capacity for development He 's got as far as he can . And that 's not far , is it ? With regard to women , well , dear Gertrude ... modern women understand everything , I 'm told . Except their husbands . That is the one thing the modern woman never understands . And a very good thing too , dear , I dare say ... it might break up many a happy home if they did . Not yours , I need hardly say , Gertrude . You have married the perfect husband . And now , dear ladies , I had better set forth . I have n't time to be idling around here all day . I should be idling around somewhere else very shortly or I shall fall behind . No , no , I 'll see myself out . No doubt you both have pleasant reminiscences
zone2	Goodbye , my dear Wonderful woman , Lady Markby , is n't she ? Talks more and says less than anybody I ever met . Now , Gertrude . Mrs . Cheveley . I think it is right to tell you that I wish you never to return to this house again . And never to attempt to contact my husband . I see that after all these years you 've not changed a bit . I hope I never will . Then life 's taught you nothing ? It has taught me that a person who has once been guilty of a dishonest and dishonorable action may be guilty of it a second time and should be shunned . Would you apply that rule to everyone ? Yes . Without exception . Then I am sorry for you Gertrude . Very sorry for you . I thank you for your sympathy ... but it is your departure I would prefer . Do you know , Gertrude , I do n't mind you talking morality a bit . Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people whom we personally
zone2	of that . And I have always detested you . And yet I have come here to give you some advice . I hold your husband in the hollow of my hand ... and if you are wise you 'll make him do what I tell him . How dare you class my husband with yourself ? ! Leave my house ! You are unfit to enter it ! Your house ? A house bought with the price of dishonour ? Everything in which has been paid for by fraud . Ask him what the origin of his fortune is . Get him to tell you how he sold to a stockbroker a Cabinet secret . Learn from him to what you owe your position . It is not true . Robert ... tell her it is not true . Go . Go at once . You 've done your worst now . Dear Sir Robert ... Lady Chiltern ... unless you meet my terms I think you 'll fine the worst is yet to come . You have until half past ten tonight . Tell me it is not
zone2	not true ! Please . let me tell you , please ! Listen to me ! No , do n't come near me ! Do n't touch me ! Listen to me ! How could you ? ! How could you do that , Robert ? ! You 've lied to the whole world ! You , you will not lie to me . Gertrude , please , I must tell you ! No , do n't say ... do n't say anything ! You were to me ... something apart from common life . A thing noble pure . The world seemed to me finer because you were in it . And goodness more real because you lived ... I 'm ... I 'm sorry . So very sorry . I , I suppose I should go . Should I ? Go . Get out ! Ah , my second button-hole . Much better . And , do you know , Phipps ... a really well made button-hole is the only link ... between art and nature . Yes , my Lord . I do n't think I quite
zone2	. Makes me almost in the prime of life ? I do n't observe any alteration in your Lordship 's appearance . You do n't ? No , my Lord . Hmm , very well . Oh my God ! Father , how delightful to see you . Take my cloak off . Er , is it really worthwhile , father ? Of course it 's worthwhile , sir . Ah , but you see I 'm afraid I 've recently made a resolution not to have visitors ... on Thursday between er , seven and nine in the evening . Glad to hear it . Ca n't stand interruptions . No draught , I hope , in this room . No , sir . I feel a draught , sir . I feel it distinctly . So do I , sir . A dreadful draught , sir . Why do n't you go home ? I will come and see you tomorrow and we can talk about anything you like then . I have called this evening with a definite purpose ... and I 'm going to see it
zone2	Put my cloak down , sir . I hate seeing things through , father especially when it 's through someone else 's eyes . ' Fraid I do n't follow you there . sir . Well , as far as I can make out , you seem to follow me everywhere , father . I 'll take that ... Oh God ! Good evening , Arthur . My dear Robert . The fact is I really am horribly busy tonight . But , Arthur , I must speak with you . Gertrude has discovered the truth ? Yes , I 'm afraid she has . Come in , Robert . Come in . But , if you would n't mind waiting for a short while ... I 'm afraid I 'm right in the middle of giving my performance of the attentive son . Oh , I 'm sorry . Hmm , so am I . Phipps . God ! When you left this afternoon my life fell apart . My love is in ruins . I need you after all . I am coming to you now Gertrude .
zone2	on particular business . Show her into the drawing room when she arrives . Do you understand ? Ah , yes , my Lord . This is a matter of the gravest importance . I understand , my Lord . No one else is to be admitted under any circumstances . Tell them I 'm not at home . I understand , my Lord . Good . Arthur ? Yes , father . Good evening , Phipps . How nice to see you again , madam . His Lordship is engaged at present with Lord Caversham , madam . How very filial . His Lordship told me to ask you , madam ... Er , to be kind enough , Er , to wait in the drawing room for him . His Lordship will come to you there . Lord Goring expects me ? Yes , madam . Are you quite sure ? His Lordship 's directions on the subject were very precise . No , I do n't care for that lamp . It is far too glaring . Light some candles . Certainly , madam . Marriage is
zone2	of common sense . Yes , but women who have common sense are usually so curiously plain . Of course I 'm only speaking from hearsay . No woman , plain or pretty , has any sense are so plain , are n't they , father . Common sense is a privilege of our sex . Quite so and we men are so self-sacrificing we never use it , do we , father ? I use it , sir . I use nothing else . Mum , so my mother tells me . It is the secret of your mother 's happiness . What was that ? Nothing , father . Nothing . You are heartless , sir Very heartless . Oh , I hope not , father . When you left this afternoon my life fell apart ... I am coming to you now Gertrude . There we are , madam . Thank you . Thank you , madam . I 'm afraid His Lordship 's not at home this evening , milady . I , I see . I 'm sorry , Lady Chiltern . Not at all
zone2	? Yes , my Lord . Oh , my dear fellow . I 'm sorry , Arthur , I did n't know where else to go . I do n't know what to do , Arthur . Robert , last night you were telling me ... how much Gertrude means to you , hmm ? How much you love her . More than anything in the world . But there is a wide gulf between us now ... and I fear I shall never bridge it . I fear she will never forgive me . Surely there must be some sin in her past life Any sin ... weakness , perhaps , that might well ... help her to understand yours . No , I do n't believe Gertrude knows what weakness or temptation is . But she loves you , Robert . She can not but forgive you . Now I feel certain that if she could hear you now ... the regret you feel about your past ... Regret ? Yes , regret ... I feel certain that she would pity you . Perhaps even at this moment
zone2	again be in your arms . God grant it but I doubt it . There is something else I need to tell you about . The debate on the Argentine canal is to begin at ten thirty . I have made up my mind what I 'm going to say . I have decided ... What was that ? Nothing . I heard a noise from next door . No , no you did n't . Is there someone there ? Arthur ? Robert ... you 're excited , unnerved . There is no-one in that room . Now sit down , old man , for God 's sake ! Do you give me your word of honor ? Oh , yes ! Let me look for myself . Oh , Robert ... If there is no-one there then why should n't I look ? Robert ... there is someone in that room . My dear fellow , I do apologize but I must state she 's entirely guiltless in this matter . She is scheming devious and deceitful . I beg your pardon ? And you ... you are
zone2	Good evening , Lord Goring . Sir Robert . So tell me , Goring , how the devil do you explain her presence here ? To be quite honest , I ca n't I ... I take you two have been planning this for some time . Look , Robert believes me , we have not . We have never planned anything . Except marriage , of course , Lord Goring . Come now , Arthur , you ca n't have forgotten we were engaged for at least three weeks . Yes , but ... At this moment I find it hard to see why on earth you broke it off You seem to be ... entirely well suited to each other . Robert , I give you my word ... No , sir . Oh no , sir . You have lied enough upon your word of honor . I appear to have caused something of a commotion . Goodnight , Sir Robert . You 've come here to sell me Robert Chiltern 's letter . To offer it to you on condition . How did you guess ?
zone2	I 've arrived at the romantic stage . When I saw you the other night at the Chilterns ' ... I knew you were the only person I 'd ever cared for . If I 've ever cared for anybody , Arthur . So ... on the morning of the day that you marry me ... I will give you Robert Chiltern 's letter . That is my offer . Are you quite serious ? Yes . Quite serious . My dear Mrs . Cheveley . I 'm afraid I should make you a very bad husband . I do n't mind bad husbands , I 've had two They amuse me immensely . Here is a chance to rise to great heights of self-sacrifice , Arthur . I think you should . And the rest of your life you could spend in contemplating your own perfections . I do that as it is . For the privilege of being your wife ... I am ready to sacrifice the greatest prize in my possession . I 'm honored . Arthur ... you loved me once you asked me to be
zone2	. Bonsoir . My dear Mrs . Cheveley . My dear Lord Goring . Now I 'm going to give you some good advice . Pray , do n't One should never give a woman anything she ca n't wear in the evening . Oh , I 'm sorry but I do n't seem to be able to stop myself . Now , I 'm going to tell you ... that love ... about which I admit I know so little ... Love can not be bought . It can only be given . And I sense it is not in my power to give to you . And nor is it in yours I suspect ... at all . Dear boy , you underestimate us both . To give ... and not expect return , hmm ? That is what lies at the heart of love . I fear though the notion is a stranger to us both . And yet ... if we are honest ... it is something we both long for something that it takes great courage to do . Yes that is our dark secret
zone2	it . And for that I admire you . Give me the letter . Prove your affections to me and give me the letter . And surrender my position of power ? The future of a great man is in your hands , Mrs . Cheveley . Crush him and your power dies with him ... as will any feeling I 've ever had for you . If you ever loved me ... I did love you . I know , I know . But not that much . I know , I must admit I never thought you did . Even so , I felt it worth a try . I understand and respect you all the more for the attempt . And I take it you reject my offer ? I fear I must when tempting as it seems ... in truth it is little more than blackmail . True . Gertrude ! Mabel . I suddenly remembered you were due to meet Arthur . Oh , at least somebody remembered . You mean he 's not here either ? Oh strange . Gertrude , are you quite
zone2	I 'm not at all . Could we talk ? Everything I have ever learned , indeed all that I believe , leads me to reject and revile him for what he has done . And yet ... And yet ? ... I have never known such joy as when I 'm with him . I 've never felt so ... free as when I 'm lying in his arms . Well , Arthur , I shall look out for you at the Commons ... where at least I 'll see your friend submit to my desires . I would n't be too sure . Come now , we both know how dearly he values his career . I look froward to him proving you wrong I anticipate it keenly . In fact , I 'd stake my shirt on it . Your shirt ? Indeed I think I 'd probably wager my entire wardrobe on his integrity . What confidence . Would you stake your liberty ? My liberty ? A rather charming little idea has sprung into my head ... and now I consider it , I discover
zone2	Go on . If as you suggest , he stands by his principles ... condemns the scheme in question , then shall I give you his letter . ... to dispose of as you choose . But if as I project ... he surrenders to my demands , and publicly supports the scheme then ... then shall I give you my hand in marriage . Precisely . To dispose of as you please . As a better man , you must concede there is a certain thrill to it . Concede too how elegantly I 've eased from proposal to proposition . And with barely any loss of face . I 'm most impressed indeed . We are creatures of compromise , you and I . I await your response . You 're all of a sudden less certain of your friend 's true nature ... when your own future rests upon it . Not at all I accept your wager in all confidence . You do ? I do . Oh , Arthur ... is n't it remarkable how those two little words can quicken the heart ? Would
zone2	accompany me to the House of Commons ? I believe there is a rather interesting debate there tonight . I believe the Prime Minister himself has taken an interest . And I believe ... that its outcome will prove particularly interesting to you . And to me . Whatever it may be . Damn ! The Honourable Member for Witney . Good evening , Chiltern . Prime Minister . I beg to ask the President of the Board of Trade ... to what extent he believes the projected Argentine Canal ... merits the nation 's attention and support . Mr . Speaker ... I believe this excellent scheme ... represents a genuine opportunity ... to extend our trading routes ... and to stamp our authority on an increasingly vital ... portion of the globe . Did n't expect to see you here . Nor did I But I find I have developed a sudden and very singular interest in politics . Married yet ? Ask me again in half an hour . What ? Nothing . The Honourable Member for Cheltenham . Arthur ... ? I beg to ask the
zone2	in respect to the proposed scheme . Answer . Let me first of all thank the ... Honourable Member for his articulate contribution to the debate . Since I last opportunity to investigate this scheme ... I have had the opportunity to investigate this scheme ... more thoroughly ... and to grasp fully the ramifications of our lending it support . I have to inform the House ... that I was ... mistaken ... in my original perceptions ... and that I have now taken a rather different view . I , I find that now I must agree with ... my Right Honourable Friend that this is indeed an excellent scheme . A genuine ... opportunity . An opportunity ... particularly if you happen to be a corrupt investor ... a corrupt investor ... with nothing but self-interest at heart . For now it is my utter conviction that this scheme never should have had ... or should ever have any chance of success . It is a fraud an infamous fraud at that . Our involvement would be a political fraud of the worst possible kind . This
zone2	. Now it seems there exists a growing compulsion to use that power ... merely to beget more power . Money merely to beget more money ... irrespective of the true cost to the nation 's soul . And it is this sickness , a kind of moral blindness ... And the only remedy that I can see is to strike back and to strike now ! Hear , hear ! As we stand as we stand at the end of this most ... eventful century ... it seems that we do , after all , have a genuine opportunity . One honest chance to shed our ... sometimes imperfect past ... to start again ... to step unshackled into the next century ... and to look our future squarely ... and proudly in the face . Order ! Gentlemen , if you please ! Order ! Order ! You must agree , it has been a romantic interlude , Arthur . You might even confess to some faint and secret regret at its outcome . For I do indeed feel some slight relief that in the end Sir Robert
zone2	, you see I 'm not really quite as wicked as you suppose . Mrs . Cheveley ! And a lady must always honour her bets . Come back with me , Arthur . Come back to Vienna . Bravo , Sir Robert . Seems I underestimated you . Robert . I 'm sorry if I 've spoiled your plans . Far more than yet you realize . Ah , there at least is some small satisfaction . Look , Robert , my dear fellow ... I have nothing to say to you , Lord Goring . Nor is there anything I wish to hear . I hope that now you are content ... that I did n't disappoint you . Robert , I ... Let women make no more ideals of men ... or they may ruin other lives as completely as you . You whom I have loved so wildly ... have surely ruined mine . Robert ... I know there is no hope for us now . I know you can never forgive me . Poor man I almost begin to feel sorry for him . Sorry
zone2	upright a gentleman , so honourable an English gentleman ... being so shamefully deceived . Deceived ? And on such positively pink paper . What are you talking about , Mrs . Cheveley ? " I need you after all I 'm coming to you now . " You stole Gertrude 's letter ? Losing a man is scant cause for concern ... but losing a man to her is another matter entirely . And so I feel it only right that Sir Robert should know , as indeed he shall ... when the letter arrives at his office first thing in the morning . You 've got a good man there , Gertrude . You should try to hold on to him . Do you know , Laura ... it occurs to me this whole business is really just about you and me . Gertrude , I must speak with you . Er , er , not now . Arthur . Please ! Gertrude , it 's about that letter . The letter you wrote to me ! ... do come round in the morning , Arthur , I
zone2	... about this evening , I ... congratulations . I beg your pardon ? I gather you are to be congratulated . Well naturally ... there 's nothing I like more than to be congratulated ... though invariably I find the pleasure immeasurably increased by knowing what for . Oh , have n't you heard ? You 're to be married . Your father says ... Does he ? Yes , he does . Did he , by any chance , tell you to who ? No . But when we saw you with that woman Mrs . Cheeseley we naturally assumed ... Oh , did we ? Yes , we did . Well the fact is ... your assumptions are presumptuous . You see ... I 'm not sure ... that I 've seen anything I quite like the look of yet . Oh , really ? Mum , really . In which case I have something vitally important to say to you . To look at a thing is quite different form seeing a thing . And one does not see anything until one sees its beauty .
zone2	something you wish to say to me , Lord Goring ? ... no , no I do n't think so . Then I do n't wish to hear it . Goodnight . Goodnight . I 'm sure that nice Mr . Trafford will have something to say to me . And I 'm even surer ... I will be quite charmed to listen ! Damn ! It is a great nuisance . Ca n't find anyone else to talk to and I 'm so full of interesting information . I feel like the latest edition of something or other . Well ... after some consideration ... there 's so much to do there 's only one thing to be done . There comes a time in every son 's life when he must , indeed ... follow his father 's advice . I shall go to bed at once . I do hope we see you in the near future , Mrs . Cheveley . Oh , so do I . But I fear , Lady Markby , that for me ... the future seems strangely uncertain . And what
zone2	Well , as a very dear friend once said to me , " To love oneself ... is the beginning of a lifelong romance " . Goodbye , dear Lady Markby . London will be the lesser for your leaving . And sadly lacking in scandal . Ah , but my dear Lady Markby ... my personal favourite is shortly to unfold . Consider it a parting gift . Thank you , Mrs . Cheveley . May I see it ? ... that is what you were doing with that woman , Mrs . Cheveley . Well it certainly did n't look that way . Ah yes , but there 's a great deal of difference between looking and seeing Is n't there , Miss Mabel ? Oh , my dear Arthur . What a good friend you are to him . To us . But the truth is we , re not out of danger yet . In fact ... I believe there 's a rather popular saying about frying pans and fires ... only this time it is you and I , dear Gertrude , who are to
zone2	I could n't . No , I could n't . I think it is better that he should know the exact truth . So you want me to tell him that what ? That I intended a ... secret ... a secret rendezvous . Yes . With a single man ? And at such an hour ? You , you want me to tell him that ? It 's scandalous , Arthur ! Well that may be but it 's also the truth and in this case it may be our best option . But I 'm a married woman . I could n't possibly tell him . Well then , may I do it ? Certainly not ! And you must give me your word , Arthur , that you never will . No , you are wrong , Gertrude ! But I will give you my word . That you will never tell me what ... Lord Goring ? Robert . What does this mean ? I , Robert , I , I meant to give it to you last night But ... Last night ? Yes ,
zone2	a hurry ... Oh , then , then ... so this letter is intended for me ? Well , of co ... oh my goodness ... you did n't think , you could n't possibly think that , you know ... The name , the , um ... the address on the envelope is yours ... She knew that when you left here you would come to me at once , obviously . Well , it stands to reason old man , come on . It 's true , Robert . I delivered it myself . You did ? You did . Certainly . As you will remember , Gertrude after my rehearsals I called in for tea . And , when you mentioned the letter ... I remarked that I was shortly to meet up with Lord Goring as we had an appointment ... to visit the new Modern Art exhibition at the Grosvenor ... which Quite frankly , apart from two studies in grey by whistler , was exceedingly forgettable . And that 's exactly what lord goring then proceeded to do . Namely forget it ... before
zone2	he never appeared . A fact which I find most upsetting , both on behalf of myself and Mr . Whistler . And we 're both deciding whether or not to forgive him . In the meantime I delivered the letter myself to your office this morning . And you know the fact of the matter is ... I still have n't heard a word of apology ! Umm . Sorry . I forgive you .

It 's just I 'm having a baby as well . I
zone2	're going to make a laughingstock of the family . A child needs a role model , someone to look up to . Well , I 'll wear heels . If you were younger , I 'd take you over my knee ... and thrash the living daylights out of you . I think you mean if you were younger , Dad . I 'm getting a taxi . I 'll see you at the hotel . Oh , God , he 's a bore , is n't he ? Thank goodness you 're here . I just do n't know if I can do it all . Well , no one 's ever ready for a baby , but I 'll tell you one thing . Having a child is the best thing in the world . It stops you from worrying about yourself . There 's something more important than you in the world , and that 's such a relief in the end . I do n't know . It just seems like such a huge responsibility to take on overnight . It 's an opportunity that
zone2	I ca n't tell you to do it , but I can tell you , think very carefully before you do n't do it . Having you was the best thing that ever happened to me . - Oh , Mom . - Even though you 're an enormous disappointment in many ways . Mom . Well , you have . But you 're you . I adore you . Darling , careful . Abbie . I 'll do it . I want to be the father of our baby . Are you sure ? Yes . I do n't want to do it halfway . I want to do it all the way or not at all . I do n't want to be ... some gay uncle who lives on the other side of the tracks ... with his roommate Bruce ... who no one 's supposed to talk to .

Did he rise to the occasion ? Obviously he did . Hey , can we move past the sex part ... and get onto the now part ? I 'm having a baby . Abbie , that is so great . It 's tough being a single parent , Abbie . I 'm not gon na be a single parent . Robert 's moving in with me and we 're gon na raise the baby together . - Are you sure you know what you 're doing ? - Look , Robert is ... the most incredible man I 've ever met . - Right . - And he 's hung in there when my boyfriends have n't . That 's true . And we 're always gon na love each other ... and be in each others ' lives , and we 're never getting married
zone2	, there 's a certain crazy logic to this . And Robert will do everything a husband will do . Exactly . - Include not sleep with you . - Yes , but I wo n't be bitter and resentful about it . At least the kid will be gorgeous . No doubt . - Will he be gay ? - Kelly ! - What ? - Come on . My God . Will your kids be stupid ? Good to have you here , David . Make yourself at home . Anything you need , just let us know . Okay . Thanks . I feel like such an asshole . Why ? Because if Joe 's parents had n't kicked me out and I did n't need this place , I would n't be helping you move out , I 'd be making a stand . Against what ? Against this insane decision that you 're making , Robert . This is ridiculous . You 're gon na be miserable . Have you thought about all the details , like ... your sex life ? Are you gon
zone2	straight and I turned gay , you 'd be thrilled . But the fact that I 'm having a baby with a woman , that 's blowing your mind , David . That 's such a double standard . So your biological time clock is ticking , that 's it . No , that is not it . Yeah . Actually , you know what ? I 'm just bored of it all .

You do have a piece of spinach in your teeth . Do I ? Mm-hmm . Just kidding . That 's good . I do n't know . I guess I never met the right woman . Or maybe I met her , but I was n't the right man at the right time . Anyway , that 's my excuse . What 's yours ? I decided to have a child instead of a husband . Could n't you have both ? Theoretically , I could have both . But if I waited around long enough for the right man , I might not have had the right child . So does

zone2	Sorry . Ha-ha . Are we a little tipsy ? Ben ordered the most delicious wine in the universe . You 're jealous . Right . Why did n't I see it before ? You 're jealous that I went out on a date . How could I be jealous ? I 'm the one that encouraged you to go out in the first place . What 's so hilarious ? Oh , nothing . It was just something Ben said at dinner . Sorry . You had to be there . He 's very perceptive , you know . Hmpf . Perceptive about me , I expect . Me , me , me , me , me . Funnily enough , you were hardly mentioned all evening , other than discussing the fact that I was turkey-basted by my gay best friend . - You were not turkey-basted . - Oh . Right . - Did Sammie get to bed okay ? - What 's all this " Sammie " business ? His name is Sam . He 's not Sammie . He 's not Sammy Davis , Jr

Just watch cartoons in an hour
zone2	. Is Ben my daddy now ? What ? Okay , well , let 's get one thing straight ! Please , Robert . - I ca n't believe this . What were you thinking ? - Calm down . Sam sees a stranger in his bedroom in the morning . You probably traumatized him . Ben is hardly a strange man . I thought I was gon na be gone by the time he woke up . Sam is confused by him , and you 're not helping matters . What exactly do you think is going on between us ? I do n't care . I just do n't want it to go on here . We 're getting married . What ? We 've been trying to figure out a way to tell you . Well , let me give you one little , tiny hint . Letting Sam discover you in bed with him is not what I 'd call the subtle approach . We did n't plan it this way . Now you know , so let 's talk about it . I 've only
zone2	the one's that have had the luxury of mulling this over . What do you think about it ? I do n't know . Well , that 's a fine place to start . Look , Robert , I just want us all to get along . I 'm not here to usurp your position . I think you 're a great dad . - That 's mighty big of you , Ben . - Stop it , Robert ! The last thing we wan na do is hurt you . - What 's all this " we " all of a sudden ? - We need to work this out . Together . Let me tell you one thing . Sam has one father . There is only one daddy in this family and that is me ! I 'm the daddy ! Absolutely . You 're the mummy , and Ben-Ben is just Ben . When it comes to any decisions involving Sam , I get a say and Abbie gets a say . If Sam wants ice cream and I say no , I do n't wan
zone2	n't wan na be outvoted . This is not a democracy . And one more thing . He 's not moving in here . By the way , congratulations . Attention , shoppers . At the meat counter , Le Grand Balu , your big salami , 89 cents an inch . Mom ? Mm-hmm . Why is Ben making dinner tonight ? We 're supposed to have roast beast on Thursdays . Because Ben 's making something special for dinner tonight . It 's a cross between a noodle and a dumpling , only lighter . It 's German . Sounds potentially hazardous and ... utterly delicious . So , uh , have you requested a transfer from your New York office yet ? Yeah , I did . How 'd they take it ? Well , it 's a little complicated , actually . They offered me a partnership . Hey , congratulations . Out here ? Well , no . It 'd be back east . So what did you tell them ? So what did you tell them , Ben ? I told them I 'd
zone2	going to try that long distance thing , are you ? That never works . If I do n't accept their offer , I 'll have to leave the firm . I 've been with them for 15 years , Robert . Immediate cleanup , aisle three . Aisle three cleanup , please . Daddy will always be your father , and Ben will be your stepfather . Like in Cinderella ? Kind of . Except that Ben is really nice . We 're all gon na live happily ... What are you saying ? Your career is more important than my career ? Let me tell you one thing , Ben . Moving to New York is not an option . What am I gon na do ? Sell pretzels from a pushcart ? Robert , do n't get upset . It just happened . We have n't figured everything out yet . I did n't say I was gon na do it . - But you did n't say you weren't . - Can we please take this outside ? Christ . Sam , come on . Help
zone2	- Robert ! Move ! I 'll tell you one thing . You 're not taking Sam . Take me where , Daddy ? The cement capital of the United States , Sam . - I do n't want to go to the cement capital . - Robert ! - You 're telling me . - Robert , that 's it ! You want to talk about this right now ? Huh ? You 've got some incredible , burning need ? Fine . But we are not gon na do it in front of Sam . Come on . See what you did ? You upset Sam . What are you talking about ? This is your fault . Everything was fine till you came along ! Everything was not fine ! No one 's trying to take anything away from you . We just want to figure out what makes sense . Me and Sam have our home here . We have our lives here . If you 're so unhappy ... I 've never been happier ! You 're the one that 's unhappy . No ,
zone2	come what may ! - You just want to throw it all away on a whim ! - Ben is not a whim ! Oh , yeah ? - Has n't it occurred to you that we could work something out ? - Come on , Sam . Let 's go . - What do you think you 're doing ? - We 're gon na walk home . - You 're not walking . It 's only six blocks . I just ca n't be with you guys right now . Sammie , come back here . Robert ! We 're gon na race you home , Mommy ! - Good , perfect . - Sammie ! Come on ! Faster , faster , faster ! I hate childproof caps . I told you , Robert . I told you at the very beginning . You should have insisted upon getting married , then you would have rights . Look what happened to me . I have rights now . They 're not going anywhere . Full stop . The end . You need to talk to an attorney
zone2	where you stand . I know where I stand , David . Trust me . I 'm not gon na see an attorney . I 'll bet she is . Stupid pills . I ca n't even tell if they 're working . So stop taking them , and if you die , you know they worked . Yeah , better safe than sorry , you mean . Better safe than sorry . Go talk to a lawyer . Abbie ? Abbie ? Those are good arguments , Robert . You 're the biological father , and , obviously , you 're a caring person . You 've been involved . We 've got a decent chance at joint custody . And if we can get that , we 'll be able to keep her from leaving the state with Sam . The fact that you 're gay is n't gon na help us . And if this goes to court , we better hope for a sympathetic judge . And I can tell you right now , there are n't many of them . Uh , are there any
zone2	Reynolds is a bad mother ? - No . - Can she and Mr . Cooper provide a roof over Sam 's head ? - Um-hmm . - Does she have a drinking problem ? - No . - Drug problem ? - No . - Is she a smoker ? Smoking 's grounds for custody ? There 's a case in Massachusetts testing the waters . You never know . No , I , uh , made her give up ten years ago . Idiot ! All righty , let 's see . Uh ... - Is she promiscuous ? - No . - Abusive ? - Uh-uh . - Mentally unstable ? - No . Emotionally unstable ? Well , not until now . Hey , why are you awake ? I was thinking about Daddy . Yeah ? What were you thinking ? You know when I get a stomachache and you make me tea and toast ? Yeah ? Well , if Dad gets a stomach ache , who 's gon na make him tea and toast ? When Daddy gets sick , or when I
zone2	because we 're grown-ups . It 's not the same . No , I know . It is n't the same . But Daddy 's fine . He does n't have a stomachache . I 'm afraid that ... Daddy does n't know that I love him . Oh , honey , Daddy knows you love him . If you like , you can call him in the morning , and you can tell him . Would you like that ? Yeah . Can I sleep with you a little while ? Yeah . Okay . I love you , Mommy . What , baby ? I love you , Mommy . But I love Daddy too . I know . Can I come in ? - I got the summons . - Well , I assumed you already had a toaster . Please do n't go through with this . - You gave me no choice . - You scared me . Why ? What did you think I was gon na do ? Something crazy ? Like kidnap Sam before you did ? I had to . The
zone2	for Sam or inconvenient for you and Ben ? You know what Ben means to me . - Why ca n't you just give me this chance ? - Why ? Why should I ? Because you love me . I love Sam . Why ca n't we just find a solution ? You do what you want . Just bring Sam back or the courts will . No , they wo n't . That 's not what my lawyer says . She says I have a good chance . I have legal rights . Robert , no . Yes ! Robert . Robert , you 're not Sam 's father . What are you talking about ? I 'm saying you 're not his biological father . My God . You 'll say anything to get your own way , wo n't you ? You do n't know ... how much I wish it was n't true . You did n't sleep with anybody else . I would 've known . You did n't open a can of tuna without giving me a 20 minute field report . Liar
zone2	! Remember when Sam had his tonsils out ? They did a blood test . He 's B-positive and we 're both " O . " You 've known about this for three years , and you did n't tell me ? I could n't . I did n't know how to . That means ... right from the very beginning you always knew there was a chance ... Oh , my God . I ca n't even remember his name . I never believed that it was Kevin 's . Kevin . And , besides , I wanted the father to be the most wonderful man that I knew . I did n't want to hurt you . You betrayed me ! I was thinking it did n't matter anyway . Why ? Because you 're his father in every way that really counts . The blood is irrelevant . It 's not so irrelevant now , is it ? It does n't change a damn thing . I 'm sorry , Robert , but legally it does . And if you take me to court , then this
zone2	please do n't take it this far . So what are you offering me ? Three weeks in the summer ? A photograph to put on my refrigerator door ? You owe me more than that . I do n't owe you the rest of my life . What about Sam 's life ? What about my life ? Okay . So Sam has a biological father who does n't know anything about him . Chances are pretty good he does n't want to know . We could argue some sort of malicious intent on her part ... to conceal that information , and , uh , it would probably hurt her . On the other hand , I do n't see how it can possibly help you . The courts always try to link parental rights to biology , except in cases where the child 's life is in extreme danger . I do n't know what to tell you , Robert . You do n't have a case . But six years , it 's got to count for something . We can still go to court ,
zone2	you want my advice ... I wo n't give up Sam . Then take Abbie up on her offer to compromise . Maybe we can work something out privately , before this gets any uglier or more expensive . It does n't matter . She 's got to acknowledge my rights as a father . Robert , do you understand that a case like this can break you ? And in the end , you probably wo n't have Sam . I 'll just be a minute . Your mother says your lawyer told you to drop the case . Well , you know lawyers . Always out to save you a buck . Ca n't say that any of this surprises me . Do n't start on me now , Dad . I know I should never have stuck my toes in the gene pool in the first place . If you 've come to say " I told you so , " say it , and let 's get on to something else . You 're going to need a little help if you 're going to get
zone2	Well , he 's the closest I 'll ever see . Now that 's not a gift . Perhaps you can come and fix up our garden sometime . Thanks , Dad . Get your boy back . He needs you . Robert . They 're ready for us . Do n't look over there . You 'll just get upset . I 've gone over your preliminary statements . Ms . Reynolds , you and Mr . Cooper are presently not married . Is that right ? Yes , Your Honor . But we 're engaged . It 's a very short engagement . Later this summer , we ... The child 's natural father . He has no interest here ? - No . - Mr . Whittaker , you 're requesting joint custody . Yes , Your Honor . What makes you think you 're entitled to that ? Well , I 've been Sam 's father since ... Objection , Your Honor . Since Mr . Whittaker has neither legal nor biological paternity here , it is completely inappropriate for him to refer to himself as
zone2	caregiver . " Caregiver " ? Your Honor , my client has been ... living with Ms . Reynolds since the child was born . He 's performed all the daily functions of a father . Sam acknowledges him as his father . For the sake of clarity , I think it 's best ... that Mr . Whittaker be referred to as caregiver in these proceedings . Thank you , Your Honor . Mr . Whittaker , did you live for five years with a certain Eric Walker ? - Yes . - And what was the nature of that relationship ? - Objection , Your Honor ! - Overruled . We were together . Is this the same Eric Walker ... that 's now serving a five-year prison sentence for drug possession ? Yes , but I have n't seen him for seven years . This has nothing to do with anything . Mr . Whittaker , on October 8 of last year , did you go to a nightclub in Santa Monica called ... Sit and Spin ? I do n't remember . - Sit and Spin
zone2	I had n't noticed . Probably . Did you notice drug use going on ? No . Mr . Whittaker , is it true that you 're an active member ... in several militant gay organizations ? I used to help distribute food to AIDS patients . I hardly call that militant . - Does Sam understand that you 're gay ? - No , not really . Have you ever tried to explain to him your sexual proclivities ? No , he 's a six-year-old boy . Wait . He once asked me why I did n't sleep with his mother . And what did you tell him ? She snores . Mr . Whittaker , has Sam ever seen you have oral sex with another man ? - What ? - Stop it ! - Objection , Your Honor ! I said stop it ! Counsel , I suggest you confer with your client . Do you wan na win here , Abbie ? You said he did n't have a chance . You do n't have to kick the shit out of him . Your Honor ,
zone2	. No , it 's about his character , and whether he has the type of character ... that would lead anyone to trust him with shared custody of a young boy . Your Honor , you wan na know about my character ? I 'll tell you . I am an active father ... Caregiver , please . Father ! I am a father to a boy ... who I love to death . I 've been living with a woman who until recently was my best friend in the whole world . I 'm also a homosexual man . That 's who I am . What does that make me ? I do n't know . A hypocrite ? Your Honor ! Objection ! I withdraw the comment . It 's getting late . We 'll take a recess until Monday morning . Ms . Reynolds , you will allow Mr . Whittaker a visitation with Sam this Sunday . ? ? ? Stayed true to the things I knew when I was younger ? ? Food and love , that 's all that 's left of hunger
zone2	the album . How much money have we invested in these guys so far ? We 're not gon na spend another dime . Oh , please . - Like I care . - Excuse me . I 'll call you back . You probably do n't remember me . At least , uh , I hope you do n't . Oh , I remember you . I need to talk to you about something important . Do n't worry . I 'm not gon na make a scene . After Abbie and you split up , did you ever see each other again ? Maybe one more time ? I do n't know . What business is it of yours ? His name 's Sam . What ? He just turned six . - Oh , no way , man ! - Come on . Look , he 's got your chin . I 'm an idiot . I did n't see it before . If she sent you here looking for money , this is n't exactly the right time . No , no , as a matter
zone2	no interest at all . - What 's this got to do with me ? - I need your help . Hey , Sam ! Oh ! Okay , let 's go . You ca n't get me . Nah-nah na , na , nah . Hey , Kevin . I 'm glad you could come . Sam , this is an old friend of mine , Kevin . Say hi . Hi . No , say hi properly . It 's very nice to meet you . Sam . That 's a good name . It 's full of Japanese people . Is it true or are you joking ? What ? Is that true about the tidal wave ? Will it happen ? - Whoa ! - He calls you Daddy . I 've been his father since the day he was born . So what 's this got to do with me ? I need your help . I need you to sue for joint custody . What ? Abbie 's getting married . Her fiance lives in New York . She wants to take Sam there
zone2	legally the father . I do n't think I can get involved in this . No , listen . I 'll pay all the court costs . I 'll pay for your time , whatever it takes . They 'll give you joint custody . Once they do , we 'll make our own arrangement . I 'll take full responsibility . You 'll never have to see him again if you do n't want to . I ca n't agree to something like this . Hey , Dad ! Please help me . Please ? This is crazy . I ca n't help you . I 'm sorry . Before I announce my ruling , does anyone have anything else to add ? I do , Your Honor . It seems like I 've spent my whole life thinking about blood . Worrying about blood . And blood ... Well , it 's just like shit . We 're all full of it . It 's good , it gets bad . But it 's not who we are . Being a parent , a real parent , takes
zone2	you , and no one can take it away . I have earned my right to be Sam 's father . So , no matter what you decide , Sam is my son ... forever and always . Mr . Whittaker , I know how deeply attached you are to this child ... and that you 've been an exemplary parent . And I personally believe that love and devotion should not go unrewarded . But my job is to adjudicate the laws of the state of California . And at this time , I have no choice ... but to grant sole custody ... to Sam 's mother , Abbie Reynolds . Are you all right , darling ? - Excuse me , Your Honor . May I approach the bench ? - What 's this about ? - My client feels he has a stake in this case . - Your client ? - Kevin Lassiter , Your Honor . - I 'm Sam 's natural father . - You 're a little late . - I did n't find out till last week . Abbie never told
zone2	Yes . Your Honor , we 'd like to present evidence proving that Mr . Lassiter ... has a good steady job and a sizeable extended family in the area . Are you asking for shared custody , Mr . Lassiter ? I just wan na be able to spend enough time with him to find out . - I 'm asking to know him . - Counselors , approach the bench . Why did n't you tell me ? Look , I meant what I said . I 've got ta figure this out for myself . I 've got ta get to know my son . Sure , we can ... No , this is between me and Sam . This has nothing to do with you . Look , I 'm just being honest . In light of this recent development , I will not render judgement in this matter ... until a custodial examination is completed . We will reconvene four months from today on November 15 . And Ms . Reynolds will have temporary custody of the child , but will not be allowed to
zone2	this court . Sorry , Robert . I know how difficult this is . - You son of a bitch ! - Come on . Don't . - I did what I had to do . - You had to bring that guy back into my life , back into Sam 's life forever ? - You gave me no choice , Abbie . - You had a choice ! You had a choice . For as long as you live , you will never be able to take this back ! Abbie , let 's go . Come on . Robert , I 'm so sorry . Hey , Robert . Hey , Ben . How 're you doing ? Do n't worry . I never let him see me . Look , uh , I 'm sorry about the way this all ... You know . You did n't leave . Nah . I did n't take the partnership , and I left the firm . You do what you have to , you know ? - How 's Kevin ? - We saw him once , but
zone2	's inside with Abbie . A teacher conference . What did he do ? He 's got a reading problem . He wo n't keep his book right-side up , thinks his version is better . Dad ! Sam !

We really messed up , did n't we ? How 's Sam ? He 's fine . He misses you . I miss you . I miss us . Go have dinner with your father . - Dad ! - Sam ! How are you ? Great , but no more daddies , okay ? Just have him back after dinner , okay ? What do you want to have for dinner , son ? It 's Thursday . We have roast beast on Thursdays . You 're so right .

I 've been eating at the local , mostly , Feathers . Getting a bit sick of it . I 'm not much of a cook . I left all that to Mary . I gather from that popsy you 're rather a whizz in that department . There 's not much I ca n't do . I 'm more inclined to traditional stuff , roasts and three veg , steak and kidney pie , steamed puds . And I suppose , on your side , what you get is the free accommodation . - I 've got a house of me own . - Yes , yes . But er ... heating , etcetera , your own rooms , run of the house , garden .

I would n't say that either . Tell me , Southgate . What do you do for women ? Nothing now . Hell of a problem , right ? Not for me . I never really wanted anyone but Grace . That so ? Right from the off . We was both a bit shy to begin with . Took us a while to get the hang of it . - After that ... - I know what you mean . Nothing to beat it , eh ? Every night of our married life . - Really ? - More than that when we was younger . You 're right ,
zone2	more her I miss . I ca n't imagine doing it with anyone else . I expect you feel the same . Not really , no . Oh , there 's more in you than meets the eye , Sonny Jim ! By the way , do n't forget , I 've got the car tomorrow . - I 'm gon na see me son . - Yep , fine . - Are you sure ? - I said so , did n't I ? So , erm , you 're a beggar and no mistake . I 'd heard of chaps who stuck to one woman all their lives but never met one . Strange world . I mean , I 've had more women than I can remember , you 've had just the one . But if what you say is true , then you must have had a heck of a lot more jumps than I have . - So who 's the winner , eh ? - Did n't think it was a competition . You are a prissy little tight-arsed bastard , are n't
zone2	. - Hello ? - Is that still the number for Sabrina ? ' I 'll just see if she 's free , sir . - ' Who should I say it is ? ' - Er ... Tell her it 's the Squadron Leader . Reggie . It 's been a while , but she 'll remember . I 'm sure she will , sir . - I remember you very well . - Ah . Lovely to hear from you again . Just hold on a second , Squadron Leader . Squadron Leader Reggie . Oh , yes . Hang on . - Just hold on , sir . Thank you . - Mm , mm . Yes . Here he is . Posh old geezer . Straight sex . Got it up last time and he calls it the Big Bad Boy . Sweeeeet . Here she is , sir . Reggie , darling ! I thought you 'd forgotten all about me . So how 's that Big Bad Boy of yours ? A bit out of practice , since you mention it . Oh ,
zone2	- So ... when can you come ? - Wednesday . Day after tomorrow ? - Wednesday ? - Mm-mm . Er ... I 've got a cancellation tomorrow , at three . Er , right . I 'll see you then . Ah , Southgate . Look here , about tomorrow . - Yeah . I 've got to leave early . - Well , that 's just it . All off . Operation scrubbed . Need the car meself . Going to London . You ca n't do that , Squadron Leader . You promised . I 've made the arrangements . You 'll just have to unmake them . I need the car , you see . - Tell him you 'll make it the week after . - No , that 's no good . Alan 's expecting me . I ca n't let him down . - I 've got to have that car . - There 's no " got to " about it . It 's my car . I said you could have it when I did n't need it , and
zone2	biscuits ? You promised me , I asked you if it was definite and you said yeah . Now you 're trying to go back on it . Where I come from , a gentleman is somebody who keeps his word . You think I 'm just an unpaid servant . You think you can treat me any way you like . Either I have that car tomorrow or that 's it , I 'm packing me bags . Make your mind up . Oomph . God , man , keep your hair on . You can have the ruddy car if it means so much to you . I 'll go up by train . Suit me better , as a matter of fact . London 's a bit of a nightmare these days . Good . Well , that 's settled , then . Who 's won the pools , then ? So you get to drive his Elvis , and what does he get ? Well , he 's like a lot of these Neville Park types . He 's got no idea how to look after
zone2	house . It works out . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . What 's wrong with that ? And he gives the orders and you take ' em ? Mum 's dead and you do n't feel right unless someone 's bossing you about . It is n't like that at all , Alan . So what 's he like in bed , then ? - ' Yes ? ' - Squadron Leader . ' Up you come . ' Oh , Reggie , darling ! What a man ! - There you are , sir . - Thank you . Here you are . That 's all right . Thank you . Southgate ! Southgate , are you home ? All present and correct . Supper 's sausages and mash . Cup of tea ? Bugger tea . Let 's have a pink gin . Get that apron off . Jolly good , jolly good . Good day out ? Not bad . Car went like a bird . Thanks for letting me have it . Any time , old chap , any time . Just say the word
zone2	a man being as old as he feels ? Yeah ? Well , I 'm here to tell you - they are bloody well right ! Here . - Glad to hear it . - Cheers . - Cheers . I 've had such a lovely time , Reggie . How about a nightcap , back at my place ? You have n't seen it . It 's just round the corner . That 's sweet of you , but I 've got my car here . - You 're very sweet too , Liz . - Bless you . - You know I 'd love to ... - It means a lot to me . Meeting you has been the best thing to happen to me since God knows when . Say yes . Say you 'll say yes . All right . But only on condition that we go there in my car . Absolutely . Jolly good idea . Chocks away ! Chocks away , Squadron Leader ! Lovely house . Yes . Over the porch it says 1899 . So what do you say ? One
zone2	. I really should be going . It 's long past midnight . You 're a lovely girl . - Oh , Reggie . - Liz . You 're so exciting . Oh ... Reggie ... Do n't , I ... I never meant ... I want to make love to you more than anything in the world . Oh , Reggie , I do n't know . It 's much too soon . We hardly know each other . I think we do , you know . Oh , dear . Kiss me again . - What was that ? - Oh , no one . What do you mean ? It ca n't be no one . - You told me you lived alone . - I do . It 's Southgate . - Who 's Southgate ? - Just a man . Just a servant . My m-manservant . Manservant ? Do n't worry . Come on , darling . Let 's go upstairs . No , it does n't feel right , not with someone else here . - Come on ! - No . I
zone2	. - You ca n't leave me like this . - No , let me go ! It is late and I 've got an early start tomorrow . It 's been a lovely evening , Reggie . Thank you . You 'll phone me soon , wo n't you ? Promise . Southgate ! I suppose you realise you 've ruined my whole fucking evening . Home and dry , and you 've got to cock it up with your weak bladder ! You 're about as much bloody use as a fart in a bottle ! Good night ! No , I realise it was n't your fault . Bloody woman just panicked . Strange creatures , women . Like bloody antelopes . One wrong sound and they panic . - Want another ? - I do n't mind if I do . You 're getting the hang of whisky drinking . It 's your birthday . I never thought I 'd be spending it like this . Still . Good dinner , good whisky ... Who needs women ? Ever been to Scotland , Southgate ? Matter
zone2	bit . When I was a boy , we 'd spend a month up there every year . - Just like royalty . - Just like royalty . They go to Balmoral , we went to Roxburghshire . - Blairgowrie Castle . - You had a castle ? Course we had a castle . Not any more . Bloody Vivian , Lord Blyth-Gowry , " ca n't justify the expense " . Bloody toerag . Ahh ... We had the best of times , Southgate . Just once a year , we had this bloody great party . Everyone was equal , all pissed as rats , all the family , guests , keepers , kitchen maids - and there were one or two of them , I tell you ! Mmm . And now I 've got to make do with you . And vice versa . Mm . So ... we keep our peckers up . We 're not dismayed . I know what we need . A bit of music . Let 's see what we 've got over here , shall we ? Heh ! Aha
zone2	Mmm . I think you 'll remember this one , Southgate . # I 'd love to get you # On a slow boat to China # All to myself # Alone ... # Ah ! Excellent . Southgate , on your feet . What for ? Do n't argue the toss with me . Come on , get up . Come on , turn round , now . Put your arms there . No , no . There . # Leave all your lovers # Weepin ' on a faraway shore # Out on the briny # With the moon big and shiny # Melting your heart of stone # I 'd love to get you # On a slow boat to China # All to myself , alone # Thank you , Southgate . God bless you , sir . Happy birthday . Italy ? Why did n't you say before ? - Who are you going with ? - Just friends , Reggie . I 'm not giving you the run-around . It 's partly a buying trip for the shop . I 'll give you a
zone2	'll see you when I see you , then . - What is it ? - Just checking it 's OK to have the car . - I said so , did n't I ? - Well , have you got the keys ? Oh . Oh . Erm ... - Take it . There you are . - Thank you . No ! Got a letter from June to say she 's found another bloke . And , " I hope one day I 'll be able to forgive you for what you did to me . " Silly cow . It was nothing to do with her , nothing . And she never really cared . It was never a proper marriage , just going through the motions . So to speak . She was terribly upset , Alan . We all were . She thought I had a girl on the side . Got the shock of her life when she found out . Well , you could say we all did . - Broke your mother 's heart . - Bollocks . It was just another
zone2	enough for her . Vera went to Australia to escape . I 'm not listening . You never did listen . Always took her side . You do n't get it . You made me like this . You wan na know why ? Because you and her made me feel like nothing . You disgust me . I know . I always did . Squadron Leader , I 'm home ! On the terrace . Hot enough for you ? Time flies , eh ? Sorry I 'm a bit late . I 'll get the supper on . Oh , bugger that . I do n't want your long-suffering act . Come on , man . Sit down , have a drink , enjoy life . Dinner can wait a bit . All right , I 'll have a small one . Oh , he 'll have a small one . Splendid . We 'd drop dead of astonishment if you asked for a large one . Cheers . What sort of day did you have ? I would n't say pleasant . He 's in jug ,
zone2	you say that ? - Just guessed . - Come on , am I right ? - Yeah , you 're right . It 's all right , man . Not your fault . Ca n't be responsible for him all of your life . What did he do ? No need to say if you do n't want to . - I 'd rather not , if you do n't mind . - Fair enough . These things happen in the best of families , you know . Nothing to be done about it . Just get on with it . That 's it . I ca n't see where we went wrong with him . All we wanted was for him to be happy . Of course you did . It 's just one of those things . It 's a damn shame . But you 're not to blame . Bad show , end of story . It is n't as if we did n't set him a good example , his mum and me . We was always happily married . We had a wonderful marriage
zone2	you say . Hmph . I do n't think anybody ever said that about me and Mary . I do n't think I 'd have liked it if they had . We rubbed along all right . I had a few flings . Nothing serious . She always forgave me . If she found out , that is . Never talked much . Did n't see the need for it . - Miss her , though . - Yeah . Yeah . But , you know , it does get a bit easier , as time passes . Never thought it would , but it does . She was very fond of dogs . We used to have two of them . Labs . They were called Huntley and Palmer . Dead now , of course . Years ago . Hmph ! She loved those dogs . Hm . Brrr ! Getting a bit chilly . - Bit of supper ? - Oh ... Dinner , Southgate , dinner . Absolutely useless . Talk to your bloody self . Come on ! Chic To Chic . Buongiorno . Could I
zone2	Reggie , darling ! - Why did n't you tell me you were back ? - I was just about to when you phoned . - I had a million things to do . - More important than me ? Oh , darling , please do n't be like that . Who was that chap ? In your shop . Er ... I happened to be passing . Tuesday . He was kissing you . Oh ! Darling , that was Colin . He 's got the art gallery across the way . He 's a mate . And he 's gay . - He 's a poofter ? - Yes . Oh . Then there is n't anyone else ? No , there is n't anybody else . If there were someone else , if you were giving me the run-around , I do n't think I could bear that . Yes , I know . It 's all right , Reggie , but you have to understand that I am a woman . I had grasped that . And I need to be quite sure of my feelings
zone2	- Good Lord , no . Not for the world . This chap 's looking a bit peaky . Waiter ! What you said , I quite understand . Absolutely . But er ... on the other hand , I 'm a man . Ca n't hold out for ever . Yes ! - ' Can I speak to Mr S ... ' - What ? - ' Mr Southgate . ' - Southgate ? What the hell are you bothering me for ? Oh , all right , do n't tell me . Hold the line . Southgate ! Phone ! Hold the line . Southgate ! Phone for you . Take it downstairs and tell them not to phone you here again . Speaking . Yeah . Er ... Er ... Yeah , yeah , I-I-I 'll do that . Yeah , right away . Yeah . Er ... thanks for letting me know . Who the hell was that ? Bloody outrageous . Er , it was the prison . My son 's dead . Is it all right if I take the car ? Good God
zone2	yes , of course you can take the car , old chap . A bloody awful thing . I 'll just er ... I 'll just get out of your way . We are extremely sorry about this , Mr Southgate . It was n't simply a cry for help . He clearly wanted to end his own life . There 's always the possibility in these circumstances as the release date looms . But your son had no anxiety that we could detect about going back into society . And he had people who cared about him . Not many fathers would have stood by their sons as you have , Mr Southgate . - I want him to have a proper funeral . - Of course . And could I just say again how sorry we are , Mr Southgate ? Yeah , I know . It was n't your fault . He 's at peace now , Grace . That 's the way we 've got to look at it . We did our best for him . 32 separate offences . And all with the same
zone2	. 14-year-old boy . He 'd never admit there was anything wrong in it . Of course , they put a restraining order on him . He said , " If I ca n't see Gerry again , " I do n't want to live . " What makes somebody go wrong like that ? Was it my fault ? I was always hard on him , you know . Strict . Maybe we both expected too much of him . Absolute bloody rubbish . People make their own bloody messes . It 's not as if you beat him black and blue . All you can do is tell them what 's right as you see it . The rest is up to them . You loved that boy of yours . Any fool can see that . Not your fault . Nothing to reproach yourself with . Nothing at all . No ! Are you suggesting I should sell up to become a shop assistant ? Would n't be that different from what you 're doing now . And you 'll be taking home regular money every week
zone2	have to swallow our pride sometimes . - How old are you , Mr Whittington ? - 32 . I ca n't help it . I have to work to strict guidelines . The bank will extend your business loan for another 30 days . After that , either we see reducing payments , or we 'll call in the loan . I 'll confirm this in writing . Yes , what ? Reggie , darling , it 's Liz . Liz ! How are you ? Long time no see . Whose fault was that ? I 've been waiting by the phone . Well , I thought I 'd give you a bit of space . Is n't that what they say nowadays ? - Anyway , what are you doing Friday ? - Nothing . Or if I was , I 've just cancelled it . How about dinner here ? Nothing elaborate - my man can look after us . There 's nothing I 'd like better . Very good . Er ... about eight ? - How 's it going ? - Everything 's under
zone2	sit on the terrace . I 'll bring you a drink . Oh , jolly good . What 's that - Pimm 's ? Excellent . Pour away . Have one yourself , take the weight off . Calm before the storm , eh ? No , no , not in that glass . Put yours in there , huh ? Mmm . Jolly good Pimm 's , that . Cheers . Cheers . Er ... I wanted to say , I know we 've had our ups and downs , but I-I 'm glad I come here , to help you out . So am I , Southgate . Never regretted it for a moment . Will you be popping the question tonight ? None of your damn business . Well , er ... I rather thought I would , as a matter of fact . How did you know ? Instinct . Got a nose for these things . Now , do n't take this wrong , but if it was to go well for you tonight , and Mrs Franks moves in , what with Alan having
zone2	out . Really ? Oh , I never thought of that . I thought you 'd remain here . I 've got used to you now . You 're part of the furniture . - Part of the woodwork . - I know . I 'm not saying it would n't be a wrench , but it would n't work . She 'd understand . Damn silly . I need you here . I wo n't leave you stranded . I 'll call in , do a spot of cleaning , till you 've found someone else . It 's not just a matter of going round with a Hoover . I know that . It 's not easy for me either . I 've been happy here , looking back on it . You took me out of myself and I needed that . You 've looked after me and I 've looked after you . We 've been almost like a couple , in a way . What ? Well , like a kind of a marriage sort of a thing . Have you gone off your rocker
zone2	go and check on things in the kitchen . That could be her car . Best of luck . - You look lovely , Liz . - Sweet man . This is Southgate . Southgate , this is Mrs Franks . - Good evening , madam . - Good evening . I 'll serve drinks on the terrace , as it 's warm , or would you prefer inside ? Will you be chilly in that dress ? Oh , I think the terrace sounds wonderful . What a lovely idea . Thank you , Southgate . Oh , but your garden 's glorious ! Should have seen it a few weeks ago . Well ... I think you 've got yourself a little paradise here . It can get a bit lonely . Can it ? Care for a Pimm 's ? Pimm 's ? Oh , Reggie , you are clever . That 's absolutely perfect . Squadron Leader ? Madam ? Dinner is served , whenever you 're ready . Well , quiet as a mouse , really . She 'd been playing the stock market for
zone2	her stockbroker . Extraordinary . - Successfully , I hope . - Mmm . Ran it up to nearly a million . Never knew she had it in her . She sounds the exact opposite of my ex-husband . He was much better at spending it . I was left with two small children and a pile of debts . - What a bounder . - That 's what he was . But still , here I am . Yes , here you are , I 'm very glad to say . - Squadron Leader ? - Oh , yes . All done . - Excuse me , madam . - Thanks . That was delicious . Thank you , madam . The desserts and cheese are on the sideboard . Would you like me to serve or ... No , we 'll be fine . You can take yourself off for the night . Thank you very much , Squadron Leader . I 'll call in in the morning . Good night , madam . Glad you enjoyed your dinner . - Good night , Southgate . - Good
zone2	off , has another cup of tea , some more sandwiches with the chaps there , flies back to Biggin Hill . Were n't you terrified on those missions ? You never had time . You just got on with it . You were n't alone . Good chaps either side . They look after you , you look after them . And afterwards , when you landed , Christ , you felt so alive . Do n't you wish you had children to tell about it ? No , they would n't understand . How could they ? " We made England safe for you . " " Oh , bugger off , you old fart ! " No ! We did have a child . What ? We did have a child . A little girl . Lovely . Lovely little thing . Her name was Cecily . We called her Tish or Tishy for some reason . Two years old . Two and a half . Good little walker . Big for her age . Always pulling on her reins . I always remember that . You
zone2	er ... little harness things with long straps . Yes , I remember them . Anyway ... we were out , in the town . Saturday shopping . Just out . Mary wanted to pop in somewhere , haberdasher 's , something . Left me ... holding the reins . ' And I do n't know , something caught my attention . - ' I looked back ... ' - Tishy ! No ! ' Died instantly . ' My fault , you see . My darling , I 'm so sorry . I 'm so dreadfully sorry . Poor Reggie . No , not poor Reggie . It was my fault . No good telling me any different . But it was an accident . How could you have known ? I should have looked after her , and I did n't . Cecily Mary . Aged two and a half . Beloved only child . Killed by her father 's carelessness . I 've never said that before . Never admitted it . Mary ... never put it into words either . It buggered our marriage , though
zone2	a year . When she did , I could n't . Guilt , I suppose . What do you think of me now , then ? Not er ... Not much of a man , eh ? Reggie , my poor darling , you 're quite enough of a man for me . Come on , let 's go upstairs . You wo n't leave me ? I wo n't leave you , my darling . And you 'll marry me ? Will you marry me ? Of course I 'll marry you . Liz , I 've ... I 've been so awful . But it ... will be different with you . Promise . You 're not awful at all . You 're a very dear old heffalump . Come on . Er ... I 'm not sure the old hydraulics will be in good working order tonight . Do n't worry . I just want to be close to you . Oh , good . I was hoping you 'd say that . I would n't er ... rule it out altogether , mind . # I
zone2	nobody else but you # Undo me , please . Mm . Down in the forest , something stirred . It 's the Big Bad Boy . Oh , Reggie , it 's huge . Be careful , darling . Oh , darling . Mmm . # My bonnie lies over the ocean # My bonnie lies over the sea # My bonnie lies over the ocean # Oh , bring back my bonnie to me # Bring back , bring back # Oh , bring back my bonnie to me , to me # Bring back , bring back # Oh , bring back my bonnie to me ... # Darling ? I 'm going to dash now . I do n't want the servants to find me . Reggie ? I had a lovely time last night . Give me a ring at the shop when you 're up and about . Bye , darling . Bye . Morning . Brought you a cup of tea . Another lovely morning . Come on , then . Let 's be having you . What are you saying ? I
zone2	come on . Bloody hell . I 'll call an ambulance . The social worker come round yesterday . We had a bit of a chat about what next . Here he is , my pride and joy . We 're doing ever so well , eh , Reggie ? We walked six steps yesterday . See you later . I 'll be off , then . Anything you want bringing , next time I come ? Television ? Liz ... Ann ... Liz Franks ? Your lady friend . Ai n't she been to see you yet ? No ... Is that a fact ? I 'll see what I can do . He asks for you every time I go in , Mrs Franks . To be honest , I 'm not awfully good at hospitals . Yes , tell him of course I 'll go . Thank you , Southgate . Ah , Southgate , there you are . This is my man , Southgate . - My nephew , Lord Blyth-Gowry . - Pleased to meet you , sir . I gather you found him .
zone2	sooner . It 's not as if he was in regular touch , is it , sir ? I knew he had a nephew called Lord something . Glenmorangie , I thought , but that 's the Scotch , in n it ? We are proud of the Squadron Leader . He 's making marvellous progress . Can I have a cigarette , then , please ? I 'm afraid not . Fewer cigarettes in the first place and you would n't be here . Squadron Leader , I 'll pop along to the shop , get your Telegraph . Good man ! Now , look here , I think it might be a few weeks before I get down here again . Good God ! Who erm ... Who is that ? It 's my fianc ? e . Excuse me . - Darling , how are you ? - Much better for seeing you . You must be Lord Blyth-Gowry . Liz Franks . How do you do ? Delighted to meet you at last . So sorry it 's round his hospital bed . Oh , poor
zone2	am I to understand that this is an official engagement ? It 's very recent . Though we have been together for quite a while . Yes ! Well , I 'm sure you 'd like a little time to yourselves . Southgate ! Could I have a word ? What do you know about Liz Franks ? She 's a gold-digger . Thinks she 's onto a good thing . - Hardly for me to say , sir . - Sooner she knows she is n't , the better . She sees a wealthy old man liable to drop dead any moment . She ought to know that as his widow , she 'd get nothing , not even the house . If she sees herself as the merry widow , and I 've no doubt that she does , she ought to be speedily enlightened . Are you going to put her in the picture or am I ? - I 'll do it . - Fair enough . Refer her to me if she needs any confirmation . My uncle 's going to need long-term residential care
zone2	be at home . I 'm happy to . Really ? Look here , are you sure you 're up to it ? I looked after my wife , best part of a year before she died , did everything for her . I 'd want to look after the Squadron Leader . We 've got used to each other . And how much would you expect to be paid for your services ? I do n't want your money . I 've got me pension . We managed before . Thanks very much . - Thank you for telling me . - I 'm sorry , madam . Oh , for Christ 's sake , do you mind not calling me madam ? - You need n't pretend you 're sorry . - I 've nothing against you , Mrs Franks . I never thought you was after his money . The bloody awful thing is , though , he was right in a way , that horrible man . - I ca n't afford to be left with nothing . - That 's what I thought . You
zone2	n't just ... Yes . I 'll tell him . Darling ! There she is . That 's my fianc ? e . My lovely girl . Reggie ... Erm ... Reggie , sweetie ... Is there somewhere private we can go and talk ? Er , day room . Bit of a hole . We can smoke there , though . Southgate smuggles them in . He 's a good egg , Southgate . OK ? There we are ! I 'm pretty fit . What do you think ? I can do twice round the ward now . They say I can go home in a week . Not bad , eh ? Very good , Reggie . You could come and live with me when I come out . We could get married right away . Or wait , see how I turn out . You do n't have to . Do n't want to tie you down . You 're still young , my darling . Reggie ... I 've done wrong . I ca n't marry you . I should never have agreed . I
zone2	- Where are you going ? - I 'm going to Italy . And which ... chap ... young chap ... No , it 's not a chap . Oh , Reggie , darling , you are very sweet . But I am going to leave you . There 's no point in saying sorry or anything . I wo n't even say that I would never have made you happy . But I 'm not a nice person . I thought we could have children . Reggie , darling , I 'm 52 . That 's extraordinary . You 're like a young girl to me . Will I see you again ? No , I do n't think so . Though you never know . It was that young bloody nephew of mine , was n't it ? Sticking his nose in . It was actually Southgate who put me in the picture . Did it quite tactfully . Did he ? Well ... It 's over now . You do look lovely , Liz . Please , Reggie , do n't go on . I ca n't
zone2	trying to rain all day . Nothing come of it in the end . What did you say to her ? Your nephew would have told her if I had n't . She 'd have had to find out sooner or later . Only fair she should know . It 's true , is n't it ? About the house . Of course it 's bloody well true , you bloody idiot , but you did n't have to spill the beans ! She 's gone now . Left me . She 's gone abroad , my last chance of happiness . Perhaps you 're better off without her . If she was only after you because she thought you was rich . Of course she thought I was rich , you bloody idiot ! Why else do you think an attractive girl like that would want me ? I never thought she loved me . But by God , I loved her , Southgate . What do you say to that ? No need to shout , sir . I 'll shout if I like . Do you realise
zone2	on this earth ! - Just as well , by the look of you . - What ? Well , er ... I-I 'd better be off . He 's ... a little bit upset . I 'll be back tomorrow , sir . Now , wait a minute . I 'll give you a hand . Thank you , Southgate . Home again , home again . Diggety-dig . Well ? - Missed your cooking , Southgate . - Good of you to say so . Though I do n't remember it being as good as this . Special occasion , pulled out all the stops . - Found this wine in the cellar . - Did you ? Very nice too . Bloody hell , I 've been saving that for my 70th . Three score years and ten . I think it 's about time we started living for today , do n't you , sir ? Put like that , Southgate , you 're absolutely right . Here 's to us . Cheers . The old firm back in business . Except ... we 're not
zone2	No . Well , here 's to us , then . - How about a brandy ? - Better not . - Not after the wine . - You 're the boss , Southgate . Tell you what , we 'll have a bit of music . I was looking through your records , just yesterday . Remember this one ? Ahhh ... Moonlight Serenade , Glenn Miller , remember ? I should say so . We used to have a local hop at Biggin Hill , every Tuesday . - Come on , then . - No , I 'm not up to it ! Of course you are . Like riding a bike . Up you get . I 'll lead . Slow ... quick ... quick ... slow .
zone2	3705947 Mom ... Mommy , wait ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Did you have a nice nap ? - I was with Mom again . And there was a lynx in the dream , too . Well , you 'll soon see a real live lynx . At the Wildlife Park . Before we return it to nature . TOMMY AND THE WILDCAT Do you remember Uncle Jouko ? Do you know what you 're getting yourself into ? - Of course I do . People around here do n't see things the way you do in the South . We 're doing everything strictly by the book . That 's what I was afraid of . Hi , Tommy ! Grown into quite a man . The last time you were here - your Grandma and Grandpa were still alive . Do you remember the house ? Go and have a look . We do n't need outsiders to tell us what to do . It 's not about giving orders , but a project to reintroduce - an animal that 's always been a part of the local nature . It 's a predator
zone2	to count the carcasses and fill in papers ! Where 's the bathroom ? Sorry . Do n't let me interrupt your quarrel . Tommy ? - I 'm upstairs ! Jouko ... Tommy still has n't got over Maria 's death yet . Neither have I . May I have this room ? Whichever one you like is fine by me . This was always your mother 's room ... I drew that last winter , when Mom was in the hospital . Hey Dad ! Look what I found in Mom 's room . They 're Maria 's old drawings . - There 's a map too - where it 's marked " Observation post at Lynx Rock " . You should n't be rifling through other people 's things . These are n't other people 's things . They 're Mom 's papers . They might be of use in our project . - I doubt that . Mom was trying to save the last few lynxes in this area . Returning a lynx to the wild is a completely different matter . Were Mom 's lynxes
zone2	me they were killed . We talked about them a lot when I was a kid . Did she tell you anything else ? She said that lynxes were here before the people . That 's why I 'm on their side . People can move elsewhere . Leevi ? As I said , this is the northernmost Wildlife Park in the world . Even the rarest Nordic species are represented here . But we 're running a tight budget and we 'll need to make some cuts ... What do you think you 're doing ? My name is OIli Oksa and I 'd like to ... And I 'm Kalle Pokka , reindeer herdsman ! I 'd like to say a few words about our project ... You do n't know what the hell you 're talking about . Who are you to come here and tell us how to live ? It 's you who should be learning from us ! The lynx belongs to this region . I appreciate your concern as reindeer herdsmen - but the government does compensate damages caused by predators . I
zone2	without the likes of you ! My job is to determine the feasibility - of returning a lynx back to its natural habitat . First impression is always the most important . It did n't go quite as we planned . Just stand up for what you believe in . That 's the only way to earn their respect . Thank you anyway . Helena Torvinen . Gamekeeper . - Oh yes ... Tommy ? Go to sleep . Do we really have to stay here a whole year ? Well , we have this project - and a year is n't such a long time . Tomorrow we 'll start with the lynx . Goodnight , Tommy . Goodnight . Goodnight , Mom . Here , kitty-kitty-kitty ... Leevi ... Hey ! Here 's a track ! It likes to hide in those bushes . And attack from behind . Dad ... Tommy ! Do n't move ! It 's alright now , Tommy . Its pulse is normal . Good . Let 's start then . First we 'll have to make sure that the blood count is
zone2	Alright . Where can I wash my hands ? - Over here . I 'll show you . This has been empty for ten years . Grandpa used to keep some sheep and chicken here . They 're still small , so they need to be kept warm . Tommy has nothing to do with this ! You know the boy wants to be like his mother ... And you let him think that lynxes can be treated just like before ! Come off it ! Tommy knows what it 's all about ! Look . When the villagers start putting pressure on the Park - there 's not much choice with that lynx . And you do n't have the guts to tell the boy what it means . Leevi . Why do n't you stick your hand in there too ! It 'll tear it off ! There 'll be blood everywhere ! Just kidding . That 's nothing but an overgrown pussycat . My Dad 's gon na free it . - You do n't say ! It would n't last five minutes in the wild ,
zone2	Turkish zoo , it was agreed on a long time ago . The lynx is legally property of the Wildlife Park . We do want to continue co-operation , but the tests have concluded - that Leevi is unfit to survive in the wild . - We need more tests . Helena , do n't forget who pays your salary ... - Dad ! What kinds of tests ? Behavioral tests examining its hunting skills and instincts . It 's a waste of time . Do n't make this into your personal mission . Tell him he ca n't sell it ! - Tommy , stay out of this . At least we 'll do the hunting test . It all depends on that . Alright then . One more test . But if it fails - the sales contract of the lynx will be signed immediately . It 's a deal . Somebody 's come to get you . Tommy ! I 'll be there in a minute . The boy looks like his mother . Notjust looks ... It was shot here . - In the bar ?
zone2	It was Haapala who stuffed it . Jouko , help ! They 're after me . They think you 're their mother . They 're your responsibility now . Good news , Tommy . We can conduct the hunting test . If the lynx passes it , it can be set free . - What if it does n't ? Tommy ... Do n't grow too fond of that lynx . All ready for the big hunt ? - Yes . OK , that 's that . You 're not giving up , are you ? There 's nothing to be done , from the scientific point of view . You and your science ! Why do n't you go to your laboratory - and run experiments on yourself ! Tommy ! - It 's Mom 's lynx , and you 're going to sell it ! It 's not Mom 's lynx . It 's a specimen raised in a cage . I did n't know you were so interested in it . If the project 's cancelled , maybe we can go home sooner than we thought .
zone2	of that guinea pig ... Leevi ... Jaska ! The customs papers ! Leevi , go ! Hey ! Wan na see a real beast ? - Why not . Where 's your phone ? Jouko 's reindeer . Astrong one . What 's that fool trying to do ? Let it go ! OIli ... What ? Where have you been ? - Just down in the woods . We have a real problem on our hands . The lynx has escaped . Escaped ? Then he 's free now , like we wanted . - It 's not that simple . It ca n't cope alone . It 'll starve . - Maybe we can feed him . Tommy , you do n't understand . There are matters which have to be under control . It has no radio transmitter , it 's in the wrong area - and what 's more , we ca n't protect it from poachers . Quite a locksmith , this lynx of yours . This was n't part of the original plan , was it ? Of course not . You 're
zone2	say you 're on top of my list of suspects . It 's heading north . It 'll probably follow the river . As long as it does n't cross it , we can follow its tracks . It can only cross it by the canyon and the rapids . I 'll get my dogs ! Now wait ... - You need all the help you can get ! And he knows the terrain better than you ! Please , wait ! Down ! Bad idea ! If you feed it , it 'll never learn to hunt . I 'm Oula . They 're coming this way . I 'm going to look for a more peaceful place . See ya . When his Dad goes after the skirt - the boy 's more like his uncle , roaming around the forest . There 's a lynx loose out there ... And they ca n't catch it . - No , they ca n't . It 's up to us , Jouko . - It 's not my business . It was just an idea . You would n't
zone2	enough for me . You have n't told the boy , have you ? Whose responsibility is this ? They could freeze out here ! One is still missing ! Making an old man run around like this ... What have you got there ? It 's just ... I 've got to deliver this to Haapala . - I can take it ! Haapala 's dog did n't seem to like you . I 'm not afraid of it ! I can deliver that . Well ... why not . How was it in the woods ? There was nothing . We did n't catch it yet . Tomorrow we 'll have to set up traps in the woods . Helena came to help ... Yes , I noticed . - Hi . By the way , that 's a great lynx claw you have there . TAXIDERMIST HERMAN HAAPALA Hello ! Hello ... Anyone here ? Jouko sent this . About time ... You know what this is ? You 're not supposed to use these anymore - but there 's always some old one's left in the
zone2	on the alarms all the time . If one of them goes off , the trap must be checked immediately . I 'd check your traps any time ... - Get lost ! Leevi ! I think we 've got him ! Calm down ! I 'm trying to help ! What the hell is going on ? Keep the dogs on the leash ! Shit ! I do n't get it ! We 'll find it ! Come on , boys ! We ca n't be far behind ! Do you see anyone ? Over there ! Get him , boys ! I 'll catch the son of a bitch ! - Heel , boys ! Heel ! Damn it ! I should 've guessed ... Leevi ! Leevi , wait ! Stay here . I 'll be back . Wait up ! Slow down ! There 's no point in this ! I 've had enough ! Give it to me ! I 'll carry it ! Do n't you see , this is useless ! It 'll be dead by now . Even the rabbits could catch
zone2	! Well , did you find anything ? Maybe you had the wrong kind of bait ! It 's a picky eater , that lynx of yours . Have you tried a luncheon voucher ? There 's a real outdoorsy person ! Jouko ... How does a lynx manage in the winter ? If the lynx is fit , strong and can hunt , it should be fine . But it wo n't be easy , though . Well , what do you say ? Shall we get on with it ? Who , me ? - Want to try ? I 'll think about it ... for a long time . Jouko ! Take a look at this ! I believe it 's yours . It 's the first time in a long while that any beasts come to the fence . The lynx killed it . It can kill for fun ... Leevi does n't know how to hunt . Wait here . You know what the situation is . They 're just a nuisance . I 'll be off on my vacation . I have a few
zone2	Friday . Is that enough time ? Are you telling me to break the law ? As I recall , all I 've said is I 'm going fishing . Look who 's here ! It 's Oula ! Now we have a camera and all ! Take a picture ! The best nature shot you 'll ever get ! Stop it ! A real man came to rescue you , Oula ! They took your camera . I 'll get it back when they 've shot the roll of film . But you could get out of here . It came to the village because of you , and it 'll be killed . But I saved him . - Yeah , you were feeding it . And now it 's starving . It wo n't stand a chance when Haapala goes after it . What are you hiding here for ? I 'm not hiding . I was waiting for you . You could wait at home . I 'm busy enough as it is . There has n't been a sign of Leevi . I have to
zone2	him away . Come on ! I 'm trying to save its life . Tommy ... You know where Leevi is , do n't you ? I do n't know anything about him . What are you doing in my room ? I think you need to know a couple of things . The lynxes have always been killed here . Your mother 's lynxes were killed too . I know ! Haapala ! Haapala ... And Jouko . He was paying off his debt . He borrowed a lot of money from Haapala when times were bad . He still owes him , to this day . - I do n't believe you ! You 're lying ! Tomorrow I 'm going to Helsinki with OIli - and ask about the future of this project . Tommy ! Tommy ! Tommy ? You killed Mom 's lynxes . Yes . How could you ? Pretending to be my friend ... You killer ! You murderer ! And you 're going to kill Leevi too . I hate you ! I hope this convinces you ! Look at what it
zone2	The tracks brought me here . It took the geese . It left you an invitation in your own yard . Come with me . Let 's go and get it . If you help me now , I forget your debt . Open the door ! It 's the last lynx . Not much different from the others . Open the door , Jouko ! Open it now ! It 's bound to be where the others were . You 're looking for something ? Leave your skis and hop on . What is it ? We had an agreement . You can manage on your own . Come back ! Boy ! We 've always done this as a team . You come with me right now ! Damn you , Jouko ! Walk then ! Hold on ! Jouko 's ski-doo ! Easy Boy ... Good Boy ... Haapala ... He 's alone . Where 's Jouko ? Quickly now ! Leevi ! Wait ! You ca n't get up that way ! - I have to try . Be careful ... That 's a difficult part
zone2	make it ? Leevi ! Its leg looks pretty bad ! We 've got to get it out of this . Let me try ... - Be careful . Leevi ... Do n't be afraid . No need to be . Watch out ! We 've got to get some help fast ! Let 's go ! I 'll stay . - You ca n't stay alone . Come on ! I ca n't leave Leevi . - Oh , shit ! Come on ! No ! - Haapala is coming . You ca n't stay . OK , build a snow wall around Leevi and hide yourself . I 'll come back as soon as I can . Tommy ! Tommy ... Tommy ! Tommy ? The Ministry gave the green light for the project . Helena convinced them . What is it ? - Where 's Tommy ? How the hell can you be here ? Go away ! Do n't touch Leevi ... Move ! Leave him alone ! - What is it with you ? You ca n't kill him ! It 's injured . Stay
zone2	Wait ! - It 's closed ! Oh , it 's you ... There 's a boy and a lynx at the Lynx Rock . They need help fast . A real lynx ... - Idiot ! They 're in danger ! Help ! Help me ! Haapala ? This is Frontier Guard Search and Rescue . Do you read me , ground control ? Over . Read you loud and clear . Over . We 're heading north . It 's getting tricky out here , the temperature 's falling ! No sign so far on the thermograph . Over and out . Keep us posted ! Over and out ! I ca n't anymore ! There are signs of a fall on the precipice . Someone 's fallen down , and it does n't look good . Can you see them ? Leevi ... Leevi ! We 'll make it , Leevi . We 're running low on fuel . We have to go back . It may be too late . Just land and leave me here to look for him . There is a shack ...
zone2	... Mom ? Tommy ! Tommy , wake up ! Hurts ... You 're in a pretty bad shape . How 's Leevi ? Tommy ... We did n't find Leevi . He saved my life . You have to find him . It was n't there . It 's probably dead . I 'm going after him ... Tommy 's allowed to stretch his legs . We came to fetch some of his things . Tommy ... Your Mom took care of lynxes ... And I killed them . We both did what we thought was right . Maria left ... and would n't talk to me . I 'd like to apologize to you ' cause I could n't at the time . I still believe that lynxes do n't belong here ... At least not in the barn . If you take care of it and make it better , we can set it free . Leevi ... Thank you , Tommy . It 's your lynx now . Take it so far that no one can find it . Go ... Go !

It was declared by Radovan Karadzic this morning . Do n't be ridiculous . Karadzic has nothing to do with us . - Drive on . - I must see your I.D . - Your nationality ? - Yugoslavian . Good night . Idiots . I ca n't believe these soldiers . What do they think they 're doing ? Get out ! Get out of the car . It 's okay , I 'll deal with it .

I mean , with me , okay , I have my Serbian I.D . , but two Muslim women on their own with the kids , - it 's worrying . - They 'll be gone in the morning . The U.N . Ca n't allow that to go on .

Are you sure you 've got everything for school tomorrow ? - Yes , Mom . - All right . - Good night . - Do n't stay up all night . - I won't . - Night . - Be a good girl , Lejla . - Thank you for the weekend . - It 's a pleasure . Ciao ! - Night ! I have to put it first of all in this hand , okay ?
zone2	Wait a minute , where is it ? - Oh it 's here ! - No , it 's too fast ! Come on , music off , lights out . - Bye . Good night . - Sweet dreams ! And no talking late , okay ? I 'm going to bed . - See you later . - Good night , Slavko . Good night , Maida . Ah , for me ? Wow . I had them all stuffed in a drawer , so I thought ... Where shall I hang it ? - So young . - Mm-mm . - That was Budapest , right ? - Yes . 600 meters . Good shooting . I knew you 'd have to include that one . So why now ? I just wanted you to have it . - Let 's drink . - Yeah . When Bosnia 's parliament voted for independence from Yugoslavia , Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic warned of violent consequences . Now Bosnia is independent and there 's growing concern that violence , even open war , could erupt , fueled by
zone2	. In Sarajevo , many believed peace would prevail . Muslims , Croats and Serbs have lived comfortably together in the Bosnian capital for decades , forging friendships and intermarrying . But the mountains that ring Sarajevo , where the winter Olympics were held just eight years ago , are now controlled by Bosnian-Serb militias with heavy weapons . One kilometer or a kilometer and a half from Sarajevo . But we do n't shoot . We try just to keep peace and not to ... to control the surroundings of Sarajevo . You could take Sarajevo tomorrow , could n't you ? Anytime . We could take it anytime . Lejla , what are you doing in there ? Bosnian-Serb politicians still talk peace and they 're denying a report that Muslims and Croats are now being forced at gunpoint to leave their villages . - I 'm trying to find my book . - Ca n't achieve anything by war . We do n't want to take the others ' villages or the other towns or to impose any revolution . We just want to be free ,
zone2	Sarajevans do n't believe Karadzic wants peace . Fearing the worst , they 're abandoning their city . - Found my book , Dad . - Hmm ? - Found my book . - Good . You had it ! Ready ? - Bye , Mama . - Thank you for having me . Bye-bye . Bye-bye , Lejla . Stay whenever you want . - Bye ! - Bye ! 40 , 50 , 60 . Okay . Come on . That 'll be 17 Deutsche marks . - Do you think we should be leaving ? - I do n't know . I mean , I ca n't leave the hospital , but maybe I should be getting Amela and Lejla away . See you later . I 'm sure that a lot of what is happening is because people are getting on the bandwagon and creating chaos just to make an easy buck . And it 's our fear that they 're living off ! I think it 's important to let them know that we will not be frightened out of our homes . Yes ,
zone2	. Selimovic . My boyfriend 's Serbian and he 's been called up into the army . That 's why we 're going to leave . - I see . - He does n't want to fight . No , I can understand that . - I 'll keep your job for you . - Thank you . Of course . My car . Hey ! Abandon your homes or be murdered . What can I do ? Who can I report it to ? Nobody 's interested ! In Zvornik , people are fleeing with only the clothes they 're wearing . There are reports of young men being murdered or taken hostage . - Panic is gripping Sarajevo . - Look ! It 's Zijah ! Do you know how much he 's charging for one can of petrol ? 200 Deutsche marks ! ... is to buy it from the gangs that are running the black market - that 's suddenly developed . - Hey . - Hey , that 's our car ! - It ca n't be . It is , look ! They 're
zone2	- Would you believe it ? For keeping your husband up late last night , Maida . That is outrageous . That is outrageous ! I should have taped it . What 's happened ? Zijah ! He stole my car this morning . And he 's just been selling it on TV , just now ! It 's just been on ! Talking in a high voice is n't going to bring it back . No point in having a car . They wo n't let anyone through the roadblocks . - We got through last time , did n't we ? - It 's different now . - Have you been called up ? - Yeah . So what are you going to do about it ? I go tomorrow . Why ? He 's been called up . You do n't have to join Karadzic 's army . There are plenty of Serbs who are draft dodging . Miso is n't going . Miso 's a doctor . And I would n't want Miso in my army . - What will you be doing ? - Cadet
zone2	the hillsides , where are you gon na be then ? - Wherever they 're not pointing at me . - Firing them ? He said he 's cadet training . - I have nothing to do with artillery . - Perhaps you should have . Then you could tell your commanding officer to take his tanks off our hillsides . I do n't like guns pointing at me ! Some idiot might set one off ! You ca n't get sucked into all this , Slavko . Those guys calling themselves generals are madmen . They call me Muslim . They call you Serb . We 're Yugoslav ! You have to get out . What they got you doing ? Training kids to shoot on us ? I can get you three plane tickets out of the city . You 're family to us . You belong to Sarajevo , not to those idiots in the hills living out their stupid history books ! - How much ? - What ? For the tickets . I can hear . - 10,000 Deutsche marks . - 10,000 Deutsche marks
zone2	Deutsche marks for Vienna ? That 's cheap . People are paying twice that price . - How much are you getting out of it ? - Hey . Maida , I ... I do n't get anything . I just want you to get out of the city . And what the hell would we do in Vienna ? - Be refugees ? - No no no no no . We are not going to be refugees . That is third world stuff ! This is Sarajevo , not Somalia ! We 're Europeans , for God 's sake ! You can go to Stockholm and stay with Anders . We ca n't arrive on Ander 's doorstep and say , " Hi , we 're refugees . We 'd like to move into your house for the next 20 years . " Vlado spent 15 years building up his business . And I have worked overtime every week to live the live we do . So nobody is going to take it away from us now ! The moment we walk away , we lose everything . This
zone2	I 'm just trying to warn you , Maida . Listen to me . We do n't get our wage until ... unless we start fighting . A lot of angry soldiers , Vlado . That 's why you should take those tickets . You may have everything to lose , we have nothing to lose . You know the most important thing in the world to me is that you , Maida and Nadja are safe . Yeah . See you around . Sarajevo is now cut off from the rest of the world . Encircled by Bosnian-Serb machine guns , artillery and tanks . If they fire just one of those guns up on the hillside , they will have destroyed themselves . It 's just like what happened in the Gulf . The Americans will come ... pow ! Straight at ' em . But the only response from the Bosnian-Serb leadership today was silence . Nadja ! Nadja ! You okay ? - Mama ! - You 're okay away from the windows . Come on ! Get our things . Okay . Shh-shh . Okay
zone2	Hop on Daddy 's back . Maida ! They 're stuck in the elevator ! There 's nothing we can do ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on . We should make a run for Miso's . - I do n't want to go anywhere . - We ca n't stay here . Come on , come on . Let 's go . Stay close . Go on . Nadja ! Nadja ! - Leave it ! - What ? Nadja ! Come inside ! Go on . Hey , listen . They 're going to frighten us out of our homes , are n't they ? That 's what they 're doing . Who are you calling ? Slavko . I need to find out about those tickets . I think I should do that . Lejla ? Never ever go out on your own again . Make sure either me or your dad are with you . - Do you hear ? - That goes for you , Nadja . Not until those tanks are gone . And do n't ever use the elevator . Here
zone2	From their dominant positions on the hills rising above Sarajevo , Bosnian-Serb gunners can precisely target most of the streets and buildings in the city . Snipers are now operating from positions along the front lines , shooting anyone in their sights . And for the people of Sarajevo , there is no escape from a city that 's become a shooting gallery . The roads out are closed and the airport is held by Bosnian-Serb forces . They overran it yesterday using tanks to crush any opposition . Now Sarajevans must either surrender their city or try to defend it . Okay . What 's he doing now ? If you want to control the black market , start an army . That 's what he 's doing . Zijah 's militia ... opportunistic mother ... This is the magazine . This is how ... where you load it . Then you get ready to shoot . Put the safety ... always be careful . Dear Lejla , my best friend ever in the whole world . This is my first report to you from the front line .
zone2	has found some useless plastic stuff to put across the windows . Old Teddy has got a cut on his nose , but otherwise , the Selimovic family is just fine . Where are you sleeping ? I 'm not allowed in my bed anymore ... and Dad says we 're not going down to the basement because he thinks we 'll be safer where we are . Great ! Let 's hope he 's right or we 're dead ! I 'm sorry ! - Where are you going ? - Get an ambulance , quick ! Young Malik 's out there with a rifle . He does n't have a chance . Nadja , come away . Malik , no time for mistakes . Like that . You 're going to be on the front line at Dobrinja ... Chetniks shooting at you . That should do it . I 'll be all right , darling . I will . I 'll be back , okay ? Come here . Hey hey ! Over here ! First house ! - Vlado ! - Nebojsa ! - Good luck
zone2	the Serbs are way back . Back here , no problem . So , Avram , Samir , Malik and Dusko ... Nevinova Street . Malik ... Malik , come on ! Forward , for God 's sake ! Malik , get forward , you idiot ! You have to get forward into the house ! Malik ! Vlado , get the kid to the house ! Sarajevo 's suburbs have become battlegrounds . Civilians are being caught in the crossfire . Here in Dobrinja , the fighting is particularly vicious . It 's a predominantly Muslim district next to the Serb-controlled airport . Its streets are now a killing zone . Nine of the 25 men in just one unit defending Dobrinja have died in the last few days . One of the many tragedies of this conflict ... Home leave . People who were once friends are killing each other and the international community appears powerless . - Nadja . - Thank you . - Hello ? - Vlado , how are you ? Slavko ! - I tried calling you ! - How are Maida and Nadja
zone2	. Good . I 'm really glad to hear that . Where are you ? Well out of it . Where ? I told you you should take those tickets . Yeah ... yeah , you were right . I can still get you out . It may be your last chance , Vlado . You 've got to take it this time . - Go on . - Go and see Natasha . - You know , from the travel agency ? - Yeah , of course I know her . I 've given her details of a route you can take and a special pass to get you through the checkpoint . It 's totally safe , but you have to go today . Vasa Slava Street , " C " Block , 340 . You 've got that ? 340 Vasa Slava Street . Lieutenant Stanic , sir . Okay . For God 's sake , Vlado , you go this time ! Okay , okay , I 'll come . Promise me now . You get the hell out of there ! You should take Nadja

Come here , I 'll show you . Okay , you are now trained snipers . Tomorrow , you 'll be going to the front line in Sarajevo ... - One , two and out . ... to the districts of Grbavica , Dobrinja , Nedzarici , Alipasino Polje . Men , women , children ... You keep a little breath inside you to keep you still , and then you will become one with your target . You see a target , you fire . Your job is to terrorize , okay ? - Is that
zone2	my team did n't shoot in Alipasino Polje . Why , you have friends there ? We all have friends there . But we are Serbs . You 're fighting for our families . You are shooting for everything and everyone we have lost , for all our suffering . Meet Slavko Stanic , the best shooter in Yugoslavia ! Tomorrow , his boys will show us what they can do in Sarajevo . - Hi ! - Happy birthday ! - Happy birthday ! - Chocolate ! - Good to see you . - So how does it feel to be a teenager ? She hates being older . - Hello ! - Come on in ! Okay ... Oh look , this is great ! - You guys want beer ? - Fantastic ! - You guys want beer ? - Sure . Nadja , can you put this on the piano , please ? Thank you . - Where did you get all this stuff ? - Do n't ask . How much did it cost , that 's the question . - You have to celebrate
zone2	? sistance . - Pizza ! - Oh thank you ! One with tuna , and one pepperoni special . - Look at that , Lejla ! - Maida , you want beer ? - Eat , everybody ! - Yeah , come on ! Go for it ! - So ... - What ? Have you heard from Slavko ? - Yeah , he called . - Yeah ? In fact , he offered us an escape route . Escape route ? What sort of escape route ? Yeah , a route out of the cities . Said he had some friends on a checkpoint . Nadja . - Thank you , Dad . - So ... - when are you going ? - Piece of pizza for you . No no , we did n't take it . It was just for that day . Are you crazy ? Why the hell not ? We have dying people dumped in the corridors of the hospital every day and we ca n't treat them ! This is only the beginning ! Vlado did tell us we should leave .
zone2	to stay together . Of course you did . Vlado should have said , " Thank you , but go ! " For God 's sake , Vlado , we 're talking about survival here ! If anything happens to any of us ... - you know what I 'm talking about . - The children ... - Nothing matters more than survival . - You want to survive ? You have to fight for it . That 's why I have to stay . Sure , but Nadja does n't , Maida does n't . What reason on earth could there be for keeping them here ? ! You could have taken my car . You could have taken Amela and Lejla with you . I would give anything to get them out ! Anything ! I 'm sorry . Let 's cheer to the birthday girl . Thank you . Cheers ! Hey , how much does it cost , an hour for a woman ? My friend 's getting desperate over here . 100 Deutsche marks . Then tell your sister I owe her 50 ! You
zone2	me ? Hello , best friend ever . Me again . I spend half my life waiting for a mother - and here I am , waiting for her again . - Come on , let 's go . Go on . - We 'll go by the market , okay ? - Okay . Here , take this . - Wait for me , Lejla . - Come on now . - Can we stop by Nadja 's on the way ? - No . I want to come back and do the laundry . I want to give her the tape . Have the batteries not run out on that thing yet ? - Where are the wheels ? - Oh , Jeez , I 've forgotten them . Would you go back and ... it does n't matter . I 'll get them . - You wait here . - Yes . Okay . Oh come on , where is it ? Lejla , have you seen the cart ? - No , Mom . - You had it last . Okay , where 's this ...
zone2	, I spend half my life waiting for my mother , and here I am , waiting for her again . I was going to use this tape ... I 'm not going insane . I 'm fine . There we go . Lejla . Come on , Lejla , it 's not funny . Lejla , come on . Let 's go . Come on . Lejla . Lejla ? Lejla ! Come on , Lejla ! No no , Lejla ! No , God , no . Please , God , no ! Lejla ! No ! No , please , God , no ! No ! - Get her inside . - No ! No ! Okay . - We must call Miso . - He 's at the hospital . - I 'll call him for you . - No , I do n't want him to know . - You have to , Amela . - No ! There 's a sniper in the empty building at the far end . That 's what 's happened . They must have taken the building . She
zone2	all right . Vlado . Get back ! Get back ! Maida 's just called me . Will you please get out of here ? Yeah . - Oh , Miso , I 'm so sorry . - Just get out of here . I do n't ever want to see you again . They ca n't bury her at the cemetery . Why not ? It 's full . And no one will go to Bara because of the snipers . Hello , best friend ever ... I 'm not staying here to see my daughter murdered . Where are you going ? Across the city . An apartment in Kosovo . It belongs to a couple who 've left , so we can use it until the end of the war . Hello , best friend ever . It 's me again ... Miso got it for Amela and Lejla , but now Amela wants to be near the grave . He found it for them the morning she was shot . Why do you tell me that ? I 'm just telling you that he 's managed
zone2	stop playing that freaking tape ? ! She 'll play it if she wants to ! You 're only telling me that because that 's what I should have done . No , I 'm not . He heard about it ... And he ! He 's only doing this now to show me up ! Do you think showing you up is on his mind the day he 's buried his daughter ? Every time , you get it wrong ! Oh , what do I get wrong ? Miso understood the situation all along , from the beginning and you never did ! You were blind ! And who told you to take that route out when Slavko phoned ? - It was too late by then ! - Miso did n't think so . How could I leave you when you are on the front line ? - You 're leaving me now ! - If you ca n't see why I 'm going now ... No , I do . Go on , do it . Shove off . Yes , I will ! What a
zone2	the day he 's burying his own daughter to think of you and Nadja . - Yes , he is a good man . - I mean it ! How the hell can he still be a good man ? ! Go away . - Nadja ... - Go away ! Leave me alone ! Hey ! Help ! How are your boys doing in Sarajevo ? They 're okay . You got to keep an eye on them . Do n't worry , I 'll keep them sharp . This is easy . We can bomb every Muslim 's house in Bosnia . But there 'll be no Serbia , unless we take Sarajevo . So , which house you want ? Pick any house . We 'll save one for you . Hah . Hey hey , stop stop , back ! Back up . Say goodbye . What happened to my family was 10 times worse than this . Get them out of here . To all our families . - I 'll take this house . - Of course . Okay , we leave this house
zone2	- They are targeting the apartment on ... - What are you telling me for ? To do something about it . Why ? Are your sales going down ? Everybody in the estate has to use the streets some times during the week . And all the victims are people going to the water truck . Is this it ? Okay . What else do you need ? There 's no one shooting at us from inside the estate . They 've got to be in those buildings over there . You 're looking for anything ... any change in light or shadow ... cigarettes smoke , anything . Okay . They 've got to be there somewhere . Help ! Nothing . Get forward ! Sofia ! Stop ! You stay here . She 's moving . Dino , bring that car over here . You have to be seeing at least one of them . We 're not seeing anything . Get them into the car . You find these murderers , Vlado . - Do you know where Dr . Kovacevic is ? - I really
zone2	I need your help . The bodies of two women shot in the head in Alipasino Polje were brought in this afternoon . - Can you give me an autopsy ? - Give you an autopsy ? Who do you think you are ? I need to find out from where they were shot . You think we have time for autopsies ? Miso , please , any information , anything . Look , I 'm doing what I can . You have to wait in reception like everyone else . Malik ! How are you ? Vlado , hi . I am okay . Thanks . Girl , 13 ! Mr . Selimovic ? Mr . Selimovic ? - Mr . Selimovic . - Here . Please , follow me . Okay ... the bullet entered the front of the cranium here . There is a clean hole in the outer layer and a shattering of the inner layer , but it got no further than the brain . The diameter of the wound ... Would n't the bullet normally pass through the head ? Do n't you know
zone2	. Aside from which part of the body you are hitting , I would have thought it depends on the distance the bullet travels . The bullet passed through Lejla 's head , if that information is of any use to you . Therefore I would surmise that this bullet was at the end of its trajectory . Therefore shot from a long distance . You 've had your two minutes . - The bullet . - What ? That killed her . That 's five ... 600 meters away , shooting through buildings . Everyone killed has been shot in the head . It 's not possible . I could n't do it ... but it 's possible . Ca n't you get at him from here ? I only get one chance . If I miss he 'll move . It 's another 15 days looking for him . - You see that bus on the Serb side ? - Yeah . Now if I get a position behind that , I can reach him going into the building at the back . The only way to get
zone2	under the road . Okay . I was wrong . I could n't get an angle on him . - Is Natasha here ? - No . - Where is she ? - She does n't live here . - I know she lives here . - I do n't know who you mean . - Where is she ? - Please , I do n't know . Freaking liar ! Freaking liar , where is she ? Please , I do n't know . Tell me one more time that you do n't know her , and I will take you to Zijah and I will tell them you are an informer . Please , no . Sit down . Now you tell me the truth ... and you 'll be okay . So is she your girlfriend ? She 's my sister . Go on , take it . Do you know Slavko Stanic ? Did Slavko invite Natasha to go with him to Barcelona ? To the Olympics ? He did , did n't he ? I hoped he would . We were all going together ...
zone2	. Is she with him now ? Slavko ... he 's as a brother to me . He means as much to me as Natasha does to you . What do you want me to do ? - I have to go and see them . - It 's impossible . - You just tell me where they 're living . - They 're up in the hills , across llidza . It 's impossible to go there now . Draw me a map . Well , how about that ? Come on in . Ohh , I was hoping you 'd make it . Come in , come in . How did you know I was coming ? Natasha 's brother called on the C.B . If you had called me yourself , I would have told those boys on the hill to hold firing until you were over . Come in . Natasha ! Get some water and a towel for our guest . Give me that . Come in . There she is . Is n't she beautiful ? - Hi . - Hi . Ladies and
zone2	and officials of the 172 delegations which have taken part in the games of the 25th Olympiad . - They are the stars of the ceremony ... - Thanks . Why have you come here ? Oh , to drink ... to talk , hmm ? Is that true ? Yeah . Of course it 's true . We 've never been apart for so long . So , ah , what are you having to drink , hmm ? Cognac , whisky , beer , gin , what do you want ? Anything you want . - Nothing for me . - Of course , you 're drinking . No no , not tonight . You 're my guest now , and tonight you 're drinking . Natasha , whisky and ice for my very best friend . Hey ! And the olives . Why did n't you shoot me up on the hill ? - Why did n't you shoot me ? - When ? Just now . Is n't that why you 're here , to kill me ? That 's your job , is n't it
zone2	Ah , come on , we should be celebrating . A game of chess ! Sweetheart , let 's have the chessboard , hmm ? Whose turn to start ? Okay , you 're white . I 'm going to bed . If you 're staying , I 'll see you in the morning . Yeah , good night . Hmm . Good night , sweetheart . See you later . I 've never met a girl like her before . Someone who dreams the same as me . I do n't have to explain things to her , the way I feel or I think . She loves me . I tell you , Vlado , I 'm crazy about her . This is not me playing games here . First time I ever felt right with the world . #It 's a very very very good show # - # A ! # - # A ! # - # E ! # - # E ! # - # I ! # - # I ! # - # O ! # - # O ! #
zone2	#A-E-l-O-U ! # So we finally made it to the Olympics . You 're killing women and children on your own streets . This is war . You know , you were up on that hill like a little rabbit , a sitting target . I could have had you just like that . But you know I 'd never kill you . Do you remember that night in Odessa after we won the pairs ? Yeah , down on the beach . It was a bottle of this . I want you to leave with Natasha tonight . We never did find out who took our clothes . You 're not listening to me . - I heard you . - Slavko , you 've got to stop . 50 years ago , my family was taken from their home , a house like this , - by Croats and Muslim fascists ... - Yeah , I know what happened . We all know what happened . But did n't we learn anything together ? We were friends . How can you ... find happiness when you 're shooting
zone2	now . Lejla is dead . You know that ? Yes , she was shot in the head by a sniper . That was n't me . Whoever he was , he was trained by you . Natasha ! Natasha ! Pack everything we can get in the Jeep . We 're leaving tonight . - Why ? - Do n't ask . But where are we going ? Just do it . We 're going away . I 've been wondering how you 've been doing these last weeks ... - worried , huh ? - Why , of course . You 've spent a lifetime worrying about me . Where will you go ? You can stop worrying from now on . We 're finished , Vlado . No , I want you to call me and you let me know where you are . You do that , please . You said it yourself ... " It 's too late . " I hate anything to end . I know you do . And I 've had a lot of tired days because of that over the
zone2	inside , yeah ? - Okay . Slavko ! No ! No , no ! Fatigues , flack jacket , bulletproof vest . It 's all Israeli , we get what we can find . Brandy , two bottles ... French . So ... you got him . Well done . Yes , sir , can we help you ? What 's going on ? We have decided to come to work . There has n't been any post for two months . What 're you talking about ? This is our job . If we want to come to work , then we will come to work . And no one 's gon na stop us . How did you get here ? - Walked . - From Kosovo ? Yes . So what time do you finish ? 3:00 . Are you trying to chat me up ? I 'll come outside . - Are you all right ? - Yeah . I saw Amela last night . And they 're gon na give Lejla a proper burial when they get the chance . She said Miso wants
zone2	. I went in the morning to get water . There was shooting by the water truck , but no one was hurt . Zelijko was crying when I told him about you . So you see , he did n't hate you . That 's all I can think of today . I 'll be better tomorrow .
zone2	4927870 It is Miguel ! There is no help out here . - You ought to pour me a little down here . - Your credit has been drunken up . You , at the bar ... Hear me out there ? Turn around . I 'm talking to you . I do n't ask it again . Hey , mister ! Wait up there . - You 're sure a pretty good killer . - Not to tell that I 'd wish to be one . - Where you 're from ? - No place in particular . - Where are you headed ? - Same place . I did really appreciate that drink . I 'd like to make it up with you , maybe discuss a business proposition with you . In case you did n't notice , I tend to attract trouble . Well , I noticed that you got out of it pretty damn good . - These fellows , they ... - Regulators . I guess they must 've made you a pretty important man , huh . Half a million dollars . That 's what I want to discuss with you . If
zone2	one up . It ai n't much , but at least keeps the rain out . Make yourself at home . - You 're as hell jumpy , mister . - No . Suspicious . - Why them regulators were trying to kill you ? - Religious differences . Religious differences ? I never know a regulator had a religion . They ai n't nothing but a rich man hard law . - I killed someone . - Why do n't that surprise me . Who ? I just figure if we are partners now , I should know who 's trying to kill us . Maybe I should strangle one of these chickens for the trail and go on . I 'm just wondering how a man gets such bad enemies and all . I never had any good one's . The whole thing started right at the end of the war . A Federate captain by the name of Cluster and four of his men , they disappeared with what was left of the Confederate war chest . With a half of a million dollars in gold .
zone2	three months later , the captain was all sick of fevers chills up in Huntsville , Alabama . They hang him for a pig-headed Confederate troops , maybe the one who was still fighting a war . The one Jefferson had long given up on . And it shows up about the gold ? - But a map . - You have this map ? I got a part of it . See Captain Cluster , he thought the South was gon na rise again and a half million dollars would help , but the gold was a temptation and he put the map in four pieces . He gave it to four of his men . Told each of them was to meet him in Aberdeen three years later . But he was dead inside of two days . So why did n't the four of you just put the pieces together there and then ? We could n't because we did n't know who each other was . Two days after the Lee 's surrender I took a bullet . I had to cut off my leg .
zone2	Dye , Colby and me . That 's the three of us that turned up . We never knew who the fourth man was ... It seems he did some whiskey talking one on night to a bunch of red-legs and Colonel Skinner takes his part and gets the whole story . So , Skinner he shows up and has it made he 's one of us . But Colby recognized him , and all hell broke loose . And Colby and he died ? The last time I heard Colby is doing some time down in Del Rio , Mexican territory . - And still no one knows where this money is ? - No . But the Red Legs has got pieces of that map and I ai n't gon na stop to find all . Red Legs and Regulators ... the only thing that came out of war is a new name for killers . Amen . - So why do you tell me all this ? - Because I need a partner . If I had n't lost my leg and I could still get around
zone2	you 're confused about who I am . You bought me a drink . That 's a hell of a lot kindness I 've been shown a long time ... Besides , you can shoot . And I know if you 'd decide you 're gon na kill me for gold , you ai n't gon na make no bad job out of it and leave me dying slow . I ca n't go alone and I ca n't stand the idea the Yankees vigilantes finding that gold . Why now ? It 's been sitting there for a while . Why the rush ? Because I 've seen one of them . - Where ? - Right here . About a week ago . - I 've seen him but he did n't see me . - So that 's hope passing a fact . Well I 'm still here talking , ai n't I ? Time is running out . They 're getting close . Let 's see that map . Four different holsters , four different men . You put them together and you got the map
zone2	gold . - Regulators . - We figured on burying them ... I do n't know what happened first hand . This gentleman ... - Dragging a pine coffin along with him ? - Yeah . Where is he now ? A wagon and a horse . Maybe 10 , 12 hours ago . They 're not alone . Maybe 15 riders trailing them . Horseshoe markings say they 're Union ponies . Damn ! That hurts ! What the hell did you do that for ? We leave in five minutes . I wo n't wait . Where the hell do you think you 're going ? You do n't even know where 's Colby 's jail . In five minutes I wo n't care . Listen , I 'm sorry about that picture . I 'd be proud . Is that your family ? A real nice family you got there . - You do n't like to talk much , do you ? - No . - Is it me ? - It might get to be . Until how long ? Do you ever talk to
zone2	to know when to shut up . What do you talk about ? No one else finds me this fascinating . Why do you ? Well , it ai n't that you 're so fascinating , it 's just that you 're the alone here . So , what do you talk about ? A prayer : " Dear God , save me from one-legged drunts . " Well , I reckon you should have prayed harder , huh ? Do you got any idea how us to get in this place ? - You could start shooting each other . - We 've come to visit someone . - Who ? - A man with the name Jacob Colby . - You can ? - We can be if it 'll help . - Visiting or moving in , Dooley ? - A social chat . You got a smoke ? - Weighed you . You 're better than I expected ... - Just this once . Meaning ? Well , this is my last meal . And you two are the first and last visitors . Being that
zone2	hell are you ? The man that gives you a last smoke . We kind of thinked how to break you out . The only way out is way up the wall . You got a light for this ? So where 's the holster ? - That piece of information dies with me - Why ? It ai n't doing you no damn good . It never has . But I do n't see , facing a firing squad will give me the comfort that someone else , even you Dooley , is gon na enjoy that gold . Well , if I did promise not to enjoy ? You might succumb to the temptation . You 're a nasty no-good son of a bitch . Do you know that , Colby ? Watch me tomorrow , they 're gon na march out in that cope yard , and tie me to that post , and shoot me . If the village of Pedraz is to survive , we must stand together . We must put faith in ourselves and into God . To not do this , is
zone2	it make them Federales . It make them beyond the law . But not beyond justice . You better forget justice . They do what they want . I 've come from the village of Quello . Here too they have taken all we had . They barely left us our sweat ! More is what they want , always more . You see ? To give in accomplishes nothing . The Reds , the Reds ! Stop it ! There 's a lack of Christian spirit in your pasture , Padre . We are your protectors , yet you predict against us . - You sent riders for help against us . - You bring us dead men . - Some lessons are hard brought on , Padre . - You take what little we have . You bleed every village in this valley . And when there 's no more blood , you 'll burn them ? You 're an insightful man , Padre . A donation for your church , Padre . There have been for years stories of gold coins that grow in the valley 's
zone2	Civil War of the United States . I , of course , do not believe such stories . But I believe in that . - That 's all you believe in ? - Have you found this treasure , Padre ? - And live like this ? - You 're a cautious man . - Do you know where it is ? - No . I 'll have no more to say to you . You 'll have much to say if I find you have lied . - What happened to turn the other cheek , Padre ? - I 'm too tired to turn bloody cheeks ! Forgive me , Father , for what I plan to do . Help us . Send someone , someone with the courage I lack . Send someone to kill this man . Ready . Aim . Fire ! Do we ride on Dooley , Colonel Skinner ? We 'd have them in no more than 10 minutes . - And then we would n't have all four holsters ? - No , sir , but ... They are on a down-way
zone2	to greet them . - Fetch time . - What ? - What 's the gun for ? - I do n't know ... It cut out small talk . Take the gun away . - We did n't come to hurt you , Jacob . - Not yet anyway . After all I 've been through , do you think a gun is gon na scare me ? Well , it do n't and you do n't . And you ca n't make me talk . I can make you wish you had . Damn , Colby . Before the jail break you had yourself lonesome . - I did n't ask you to break me out . - Which is why it was a nice gesture of ours . I suggest you tell us . Patience ai n't exactly his strong suit . What is ? Shooting people is making me impatient . This whole damn thing is crazy . The best chance we got to find that gold is we all stick together . There 's plenty around . What marches ya ? A bullet in the
zone2	huh ? - I guess times made you too dumb to be cynical ? - Gentlemen , we 're getting to the impatient part . - Why ? I 'm just giving it up . - You better tell us . - I sure wish I knew where it was . But I lost it in a poker game . I lost the holster , I lost the gun , the money ... Where did you lose it at ? In Sterling . A man named ... - ... some gambler . - Did you know what he has ? - I was drunk . I did do some talking ... - Damn , Colby . Did you tell him or not ? What 's it matter ? He only had one piece . Is there only a chance you believe me ? I told you all I had to tell ! What the hell are you doing this for ? Or perhaps I sleep with my open eyes ... Do n't look at me . It 's your own damn fault . That 's him , he . Whisky
zone2	I ca n't drink with my hands tied . You know , what happening is wrong ? I mean we folks have the same enemies , believe in the same things . Now I am the one who 's tied up , and he 's the one who 's gon na walk and get our map . I did n't know realize it was our map . And what 's all these care taking for ? It 's too late for the South to rise again , Dooley , the same man knows that . And I figure you 're still clinging to a taste sanity ... That cowboy is gon na take off with our gold and we 'll end up dead . I know this Akers . Well , I 've seen this cowboy shooting . The man has an incredible talent . And Akers owns the town . Sometimes it just come down to numbers . Man for man , we shot them northern boys . They just kept coming . Nobody is made of lead . At least we can do is even up the odds
zone2	Dooley ? There was a time that you whacked up the floor with this Akers . Yeah , the times have changed . It has nothing to do with time . You just gave up on being a hero . - You look like you could use some company . - Not with people in any case . - You 're not real friendly . - I 'm getting by ... That holster , where did you get it ? My boss has one just like that , he might be buying yours . I 'm not interested in selling . Really ? Well , my advice is you speak with him first . - That 's no advice , sounds like a warning . - Either way , he 's waiting upstairs . Do n't worry about your drink . I 'll make sure it do n't go to waste . Stop here . Knock . - You got to be mad . - Drop the gun . Now , the holster . Well , I ca n't say I can put a conclusion to it . It 's
zone2	We better find Dye . If you 'd get me tied up , cowboy . It ai n't fair . He gave help . All right . See , you remember : you ai n't fast enough and you ai n't smart enough . - For what ? - For anything . He has been here . One man , with four eyes ... Do you know him ? - No , I never met him . - Better you do n't . He 's damn fast with the gun . - Someone is always faster . - He 's the one . - For what ? - The one who 's always faster . He 'll have his chance to prove it . Where is he headed from here ? I was n't inclined to ask . What has he done ? - He brought down a son . - Are n't the others too looking for him ? - Others ? - Red Legs . They came an hour later . They rode in , took a look , and rode out . - So he have been
zone2	. The man has a talent for making enemies . He took something of mine . And I 'd like it back . A pair of matching leather holsters . A $1,000 reward for the return . - Sentimental value . - It must 've been your mam's . - Well ? - I 'm not interested . Whose son he killed that it 's so damn important ? Mine . If we force these horses , they 're gon na drop . If we do n't get ground on , we 're gon na lose him to the Red Legs . - Well , dead is dead . - I do n't want him dead . I 'm looking for a gentleman named Troy Dye . They got a nice way of life , these people got around here . Fighting this land has no future . - What do you know about the future ? - Nothing . But I know enough about not having one . You found out anything ? They will trade a hot meal for a little help . About Dye , you mean
zone2	time inconsiderate . Now , we got to get our sentimental stuff out of the way ... Have you ever seen a body close up after it 's been ... No . Me neither . But no matter how I think about it , it do n't come out pretty . That 's why you 're gon na dig . I got him ! Dooley , here he lies ! I 'd say he looks any worse than being dead . There it is . Right behind on his hip . Here . What kind of idiot thing you 're doing now , Colby ? I 'm just pealing out , Dooley . Skinner has a piece of this map . And I do n't see it fitting no matter how good that cowboys is with a gun . So maybe I sell them to pieces or maybe I sell them back to Akers . Either way we ai n't getting any closer . And even if we did I can see at the cowboy no peace for me . - Ai n't that right , cowboy ? - Just
zone2	that , Colby . I reckon we ought to bury him . You ... find the head and I 'll bury the rest of it . Like you said bury his body too . - Colby , he was once a friend . - And once he was n't . It was wrong that man ended like this . It 's not I never killed anybody before . You want an absolution ? Try the church , not me . You know something ? You 're a hell of a shot killing one . But in the human department you need some basic requirements . How come you did n't draw out on Colby when you had the chance ? You seemed to have things pretty well on hand . Fuck , I 'm in for a drink . And maybe a little something to eat . I promise , I 'll talk to you . Do you think that once you 've shooten me , is gon na improve your situation ? - Are you looking for me , Skinner ? - No . I found you , one-legged
zone2	numb . - If you drop me , you lose the whole thing . - Before I 'll be pulling this trigger . - Yeah , well not if I pull first . Somebody better shoot somebody . Here is a rope . I tie this up to that coach . Now you act reasonable and I 'll pull your butt up . No , you 'll shoot me and take the map . - Your choice : gun , holster , rope . - I 'd choose before my arm 's letting go , Skinner . What the hell , Dooley ? That rope was n't tied off ? If I could n't grab hold I 'd have down with him ! You seemed to have things well on hand . - Pedraza . That mean anything to you ? - No . - I reckon there 's a fountain and a tree ? - Yeah . But I do n't know what that is . Could be a well . The Captain was not exactly a Leonardo da Vinci . And no Magellan either . That is definitely
zone2	ride here . I 'm gon na sleep , I 'm bushed . Do you think so ? Why ? We ai n't got any Red Legs on the tail . I heard him scream , but I did n't see him die . - That church should n't be here . - Maybe it 's the wrong town . I think it 's the only town . I do n't know about you , but I 'm gon na put me and these horses asleep . Hey ! Get out of here ! Get out ! What are we to do with such trouble ? You could feed them . - Why are you here ? - I 'm not sure where here is . - Pedraza . - Then I 'm a tourist . The only tourists who come here do surely have a price on their heads . It sounds like people you 'd avoid . For the children . You do n't mind me , do you . - You should have let me kill him . - I will , I will ... After we
zone2	welcome you . - Welcome ? - And to thank you . For helping those children . In truth I 'm surprised the captain did not ... Shoot me ? - There can be only one reason . - That being ... ? - The reason for you being here . - What reason is that ? This village has been unlucky . There 's nothing that rides in that is n't bad news . There 's no one ever ride out with some guidance or good . Look around you . They 're like dog waiting to be kicked . People long ago forgot what this town meant . If you could explain why you think I am here ? You will change all this . Perhaps you do not yet notice yourself . Sometimes it just happens . There you can find a bed , a bath , and food that will not kill you . When you wish to talk to me , I 'll be waiting . He is the man we have been waiting for . Pray for him . - Are you sure ?
zone2	is the man . Do you mind ? Sorry . One pesos for a simple bath , two pesos for a bath with . - With what ? - With whatever it is you like to get besides cleaning . It 's been too long between baths for me to remember . Well , you sure as hell look like you could use one . I recommend you take the two pesos bath . She 's mighty friendly . - We need to talk . - Now ? See you later . You just put a damper on a hell of a romantic moment . Well , here 's another damper . The Padre knows why we 're here . That should n't be a surprise . We 'd be at the fiesta with all the people who seem to know . Did you find out what that church got to do on our " x " ? I did n't ask . The Padre was too damn happy to see me . It makes me nervous . No one has ever been happy to see me . It 's
zone2	Maybe you took some pretty big steps . You see anything that looks more promising ? It should be right here . Here . That piece of cloth that 's stuck under there , this altar had to be moved . I 'm sorry to disturb your prayer . I just came to lock up . Do n't bother , Padre . These are n't prayers any ways . I do n't understand the gold has kept this long and did go nowhere . Dooley , you 've waited four years for this . I do n't know why a tale is so important ? Is a matter of arithmetic . It 's been five years since I had any . Are you ready ? There it is . You see ? There was a reason not to kill him . And what now ? No more reason . I smell me some gold . - How are you doing ? - Just edgy . You ? I 'm fine . They were here . The place they just left is about as close we seem to get . You
zone2	. - Perhaps ... were they Americans ? - You have seen them ? - What do you and your friend want ? That 's none of your business . There are five of us against two of you . That can make it our business . Actually , five to one . Keep this a fair fight . How about your men ? You have a short fuse , my friend . No . No fuse and we 're not friends . Now let him go . You 're gon na tell me what you 're doing here , or I 'll kill him . If you kill him , you die too . You 're not immune . Just tell me about these other Americans and you can walk away from this . I do n't have to tell you nothing . If you listen very carefully you understand why you do . I do n't know , Padre . You must be a big believer in miracles . I 'm sorry . I did n't tell you this . There is enough bloodshed . And it 's
zone2	why did you let it there ? Because it did n't belong to us . But at as times of dying out ... Little by little we give some out . A coin here and there to help . But then you found out people have big mouths . - Yeah ? - Nothing . I just ... There 's a pretty good chance we 're both gon na get killed . And I hate to die not known why you ended up the way you ended up . Well , then when we 're dead and we 've ended up in the same place I 'll tell you . Hey , honey , where are you ? Let that die after you . It sound dangerous . You better attend to her . My wife and child . The photograph ... You see , I had a small farm , staying between two big pieces of land , owned by a fellow named Reager . when he could n't buy it his son , who wanted to impress him , went with some Regulars and three coffins . He
zone2	coffins , And the shooting started . My wife and daughter were dead . And then I killed Reager 's son . That 's how this whole thing started . There is one thing I do n't understand . You ai n't exactly the kind of man who walks across the road to avoid a fight . So why I did n't end him ? - He did n't kill . - He sure as hell tried to kill you . Yes , I can remember . You better go before she finds herself another " Magnifico " . - There is only way in this fort . - I reckon that 's our one way out . There 're five things from going in getting us gold . Well , it ai n't exactly gold now , is it ? We 've been through some hard times to get here . Something have come . They 're looking for you . They 're hurting Father Ramon . Where is the cowboy ? This man is not worth protecting , Padre . I do n't know the man you are
zone2	- Gold ? - The Federales took it . You do n't scare me . You 're a very brave padre . Because sometimes I even scare myself . You 're backing the wrong man . Give me the cowboy and I 'll get you back your gold . You care for them , Padre . You will tell them ... Tell them you made a mistake . The one has let you very far straight . The Cowboy and his men ! Prepare yourselves ! Robert E . Lee it is ! Come on , Dooley , get up ! Let 's go ! Are you ready ? I got to end this . Well , if the balance gets achieved , it ought to be achieved here . Whatever I could take is already taken . There , it 's making place . Just out of curiosity , Padre ... How much gold did you lose ? I think of it as much we have . - We did n't come here planning on getting that money from you . - I know . It was God 's
zone2	- Your underestimate you , Padre ? - Oh no , you underestimate yourself . There . Now , everyone has a bit of what they want . It has been returned to safety . You never did give a damn about the gold . You were just killing time , huh ? I know after all we 've been through , it may seem dumb , but I wan na stay here . The longer I live , the more after it I consider what I think is dumb . At least all that gold is gon na do some good now . Once you 'd stick around ... there ai n't nobody chasing you . Sooner or later , I 'll bring visit from trouble . But you stay on . I want you to know you always got a place to come back to . Thanks , Dooley . I forgot my gold . I 'm going now . I think I leave you here . It 's a better and safer place than where I go . I 'll think of you every day . And
zone2	of me . I 'll see you in a while . Is my hero gon na come back ? Oh , I reckon he 'll be around .
zone2	197055 ... as exiled Gen . Mustafa Yakubu orchestrated a swift and violent coup against the democratically elected government of President Samuel Azuka . In the land with 1 20 million people and over 250 ethnic groups there 'd been a long history of ethnic enmity particularly between northern Fulani Moslems and southern Christian Ibo . The victorious Fulani rebels have taken to the streets as outbursts of violence continue all over the country . Thousands have been killed in the fighting or executed thereafter . Fearing ethnic cleansing , most Ibo have abandoned their homes and are fleeing the city or searching for sanctuary wherever they may find it . Gen . Yakubu has taken control of most of the country and appears firmly in charge . There 's no word on the United Nations ' reaction to the coup but United States forces have already begun to evacuate its embassy . As you can see behind me , on the USS Harry S .

I 'm the only son of President Samuel Azuka . Please do n't blame them . Please . I 'm sorry to have misled you but there are enemies looking for me everywhere . That is why you 're being pursued . Our report said the entire presidential family was executed . Your reports were incorrect . They were not executed . They murdered my father along with my mother and my two younger sisters out of greed and my father 's fight for democracy for his people . My people . When it first appeared there might be trouble my father sent me away with this man . Col . Okeze . Lieutenant , his father was more than the president . He was the tribal king .

What can you tell me ? Yes , sir , we just discovered that ourselves . He and his bodyguard hid themselves within Dr . Kendricks ' refugee party . That 's a major problem , lieutenant . He involves your mission in the internal politics of a foreign nation affecting U.S . diplomacy and seriously increases the mission 's risk . He 's considered a criminal by the new regime . He 's a major liability . - What exactly does that mean , sir ? - His party is excess cargo . You mean he 's not human , sir ? Captain , this man is the Ibo

Send in an air evac immediately and get all of us out of here , sir . Negative on air support at this time . Airspace is too hot .

I started to give a fuck and brought you guys along with me . We 're about to walk into some serious shit . Before we do , I 'd just like to hear what you guys have to say about it . That 's all . Speak freely . In my opinion , sir we cut our losses . This is n't our fucking war . As far as

I lost my family , time and happiness . I even lost my
zone2	? At the end Handsome will use us to cheat and lie for him . You can beat him . How ? My son is in the hospital . Chung and Fanny are being locked up . Even if I win I might not be able to save them . But they are not the only one's you have left . You still have my brother , yourself ... and me . Are you crazy or silly ? After Raymond left , do n't you know what I am thinking ? Let me tell you , sometimes I really envy your wife . Are you crazy ? We have a huge age difference ... I thought I told her to talk to him . Did I tell her to sleep with him ? Oh well , who cares ? I guess my sister needs lots of love . Quiet . - You are going to help Handsome ? - Quiet . You are really going to help Handsome ? I have no choice . Macau Mon is cold blooded and smart . No matter you win or lose , you
zone2	I am going to take it one step at a time . You are really going to help Handsome ? Quiet . - You are really going . - Quiet ! If I do n't know your plan , I wo n't help you . Macau Mon is the biggest dealer ... in Asia . He won a lot of money from betting on World Cup . Two nights from now will be the World Cup final between France and Brazil . The whole world feels that Brazil will win . So what ? I know that the European mobsters are already doing something . If Brazil loses , the whole world 's dealers will win big . Macau Mon should know about this . Of course he knows ! He is a very good friend with the Mafis . He knows Brazil is going to lose . So he calmly accept the betting of Brazil 's winning . If Brazil wins , he will be broke . That night , we 'll play big two on the ship , each card worth 's $10,000 . I want you to

Can you tell me one thing , how can we make him have a heart attack ? You must have an idea . TG7 , a poison that dissolves in water . If he drinks it , it will create heart failure . Even the coroner ca n't detect it . You want Chung and fanny to take one too ? You try it . Okay ! Do n't act all cool . Get out of the car . Stop at the side . I ca n't believe he knows our plan . So what ? Did you get your men ready yet ? Yes ! After this incident ,

Never try to walk on the nails , because that 's where the beams are
zone2	was built in 1912 . The plumbing is practically new . I done it myself a few years ago , and upstairs , you got a completely separate apartment . $80 a month rent it gets ... Enough to cover a mortgage payment , assuming you qualify . 2 family . You could quit the factory . Yeah . Now , here 's the showpiece . That 's a 40-foot double parlor , gentlemen . Boy , to beat the heating ' bill . I guess you could always lower these ceilings , huh ? She 's the best buy on staten island . What do you think , Mr . visalo ? I mean , you know , there 's a down payment . You could quit the factory , you know ? Rent to the tenants upstairs ? Would n't have to work , life of Riley . No , no , no . No tenants upstairs . Estelle and i live upstairs . Downstairs ... What ? What are you gon na do ? " Buddy 's tavern . " I have my own business . Your
zone2	- - that big fuckin ' living room . With a bar and some tables , 10 , 12 tables ? 40 , 50 customers ? I put a guy in back . You know , break down a wall , and put in some live entertainment . Live entertainment ? Oh , do n't tell me who you get . ? There 's no tomorrow ? when love is new ? now , it 's forever ? when love is true narrator : It might be worth noting at this point that in 1945 , when buddy was in the air force , he performed at a special services show which was attended by Arthur Godfrey , then a popular radio star . ? There 's no tomorrow ? there 's just tonight narrator : Godfrey offered buddy an audition when he got back to New York . Buddy , Arthur Godfrey or no Arthur Godfrey , the girl waited for you for 2 years . You wan na get married , you got ta have a serious job . And her family found the whole idea embarrassing ,
zone2	for god sakes . How many breaks am I gon na get like this again ? Do you wan na marry me , buddy ? Oh , estelle , honey , you know I wan na marry you . Then do n't do this . Narrator : Instead , it was a twin bed in a room in estelle 's parents ' house until the newlyweds were ready to move out on their own and a job in the machine shop in the enzolocco baked goods factory , where buddy 's talents went largely unnoticed . Meanwhile , Godfrey took a chance on an ex-naval cadet named Julius larosa , an overnight singing sensation . I do n't wan na hear it . It could 've been me . Narrator : Even the much publicized firing of larosa a year later failed to dampen the fires of buddy 's resentment . Buddy : Oh , that was Julius larosa . We saw it . Yeah , it was right on the air . You should have seen his face . That means that that could have been you , see
zone2	Better to be larosa without a job than be visalo at that fuckin ' factory . Narrator : It was a watershed moment in this marriage . Never again would estelle stop buddy from pursuing his dreams ... Dreams which were now understandably lower in scale than they had previously been . Car one to base . Come in if there are any calls . Narrator : A series of calamitous beginning with the first privately owned limo service on staten island . Buddy , nobody 's callin ' . Come on . Come in and eat . Come on , honey . Had the slightest use for in the little borough . Narrator : Buddy 's house painting service fell victim to the design sensation of 1953 . We 're gon na have the whole house done . They say we 'll never have to paint again . Buddy : What , even the bathrooms ? Woman : Oh , they 're lovely . Velvet . Wan na see ? Well , that 's all right . Hey , you know , I could paint the outside . Aluminum
zone2	? Narrator : Finally , perhaps inevitably , a pizza delivery service . Estelle : Oh , my god , buddy ! Be careful it do n't blow up . Narrator : The restaurant buddy had purchased the oven from when he went to complain the following day . Estelle : Buddy , stop ! You 're gon na hurt yourself ! Ma , make him stop ! Make him stop !

Let him get it out of his system . What if it does n't ? But it will . It 's buddy . Buddy here 's thinkin ' of opening ' up a bar over on west street . West street ? The Mick neighborhood ? What do you want with serving ' them micks ? They got no money . They always ask for credit , and they never pay . Estelle : Do n't you see ? Look , some guys , they 're destined for success , you
zone2	, like they were pregnant with it . Buddy , he 's pregnant with failure . Oh , come on . It was gon na interfere with your business - - buddy , you could have my business . I got me a lot up in orange , New Jersey , and the first chance i get , I 'm goin ' . What the hell you gon na do up there ? Chicken farm . Chicken farm . I got it all figured out . Chicken farm ? Yeah , you make money on both ends . And you make money from the eggs . How the fuck did you come up with this ? Narrator : And ultimately , as things always do , it came down to legalities . Could the house be converted into a bar ? Yep , yep . According to this , yep , ' cause you 're on the northwest border of town , covered under the business statute of 1877 , see ? So , you do n't need the approval of the bar and restaurant commission , ' cause ,
zone2	you up forever . Huh . Hey , that 's a great law . Narrator : After the usual visit from a relative first , write it at the contract of sale . Are n't there tenants upstairs in our bedroom , if they do n't wan na leave ? Do n't worry . Do n't worry . Of serving them with an eviction notice . They got one week to get out . I know you want to move in right away . We 'll move in downstairs , oh , so , in other words , narrator : And , after the usual last argument ... I hate that house ! It 's a slum ! It 's our chance , estelle . Oh , please , to what ? Turn me into a barmaid ? Narrator : Moving day arrives . Hey , it 's a nice street . I 'm gon na ...

A couple of days . I 'm in the luggage compartment of a train . What sense would it make to unpack everything just so we have to pack it up again when they move , huh ? Buddy . ? On the green , and their helmets ? Hey ! Hey , yourself . Would you mind keeping ' it down ? We 're tryin ' to sleep here . Go sleep in your own house , you fat bastard . This is my own house . I 'm the new owner
zone2	- - you 're the one that sent me this - - this - - this despicable letter telling ' me to get out . That was my lawyer . Your lawyer , was it ?

Hey , what the hell ? Why , I aim to please . You aim , too , if you please . ? We 're off to Dublin ? That the awful truth became apparent to buddy visalo . His dreams of the success which he knew would be so sweet after years of failure were once again to be foiled . Well , who are you ? I 'm visalo . We met last night , do n't you remember ? What if I do n't ? Who are you ? I own the place . The bastard that sent me the notice . Yeah , yeah
zone2	make things hard on you or anything , but , uh , me and the wife there , we ai n't lookin ' to be landlords . No , no . The idea here is for , uh , me and the wife to keep the whole house to ourselves . Oh , that 'd be nice , would n't it ? Big , too . Yeah , well , actually , what I 'm lookin ' to do is turn the downstairs into a bar , and - - and , uh , we 're gon na live up here . A bar ? Lovely idea . Yeah , well , it 's been on my mind for a while now , seeing as how the street 's got all these businesses on it - - will you be servin ' food ? Food ? Yeah , I do n't know , maybe some sandwiches or somethin ' . I did n't get to the point yet . The point is , I 'm lookin ' for you to vacate . I do n't wan na make anything too
zone2	be right this minute . A couple of days will be fine . Maybe even a week . Are n't you the generous soul , Mr . visalo ? I 'm just tryin ' to be fair here . Let me tell you somethin ' . The fact that you bought this firetrap from that prick mahoney tells me , above all , you 're stupid , and if you think you 're gon na come up here you 're even dumber than you look . Now , I got a wife in there expecting ' a kid , so , in spite of your stupidity , I 'm sure you 'll be able to see that I 'm not exactly in the mood to be thrown out on the street by some dimwit , two-bit Italian who fancies himself a restaurateur . Oh , hey , viloola . I forgot - - the rent . I ai n't got it . Ai n't had it for months , and if you think that 's gon na be enough to throw me out , you 're sadly mistaken . The

Talk - - buddy ! Buddy ! You 're gon na hurt yourself . What are you doin ' ? Uh-oh . " If said dwelling has no more than due notice " and one rental apartment on premises , " was originally built before 1913 , and originally served as a one-family dwelling ... " It is covered under the rental law of 1921 . Well , how is that possible ? Everyone lived rent free ? " Only applies to 2-family dwellings , " converted from what was originally intended between the years 1919 and 1921 , " uh-huh . Estelle : My uncle Louie would have
zone2	the tenants had to stay or go . My uncle Louie , buddy , and he could n't read or write . Why do n't we go to uncle Louie 's grave and ask him what to do , huh ?

We should just throw them out . Well , it 's what I told you . The guy 's got rights . The guy in the housing office with the bow tie , he said - - what about your rights as a homeowner ?

Hey , uh , look . Go back to the bar , ok ? I 'll meet ya there later . Narrator : That was the last time anyone in staten island ever saw Jim o'neary , my mother 's husband . He was arrested for vagrancy and vanished for good shortly thereafter . My mother recovered from my birth and later told me that the only shocking thing was that the inevitable had n't occurred to her during the 8 1/2 months of her pregnancy . At least not consciously . The brief and , apparently , satisfactory union had never entered her mind as a possible complication . Or perhaps it constituted a sort of backup plan . Her life with her first husband was one way or another , in need of some drastic change . He 's got the nose , the skin ,

Narrator : As well as for the women . Should I go down the list ? The painting business . They were pretty good

Hey , what the hell , Mary ? ! And my name is not Mary . It 's Mrs . o'neary to you . I 'd never dream of calling you by your first name , Mr . visalo . If it 's Mrs . o'neary , where 's Mr . o'neary , huh ? Where 's your fuckin ' bum husband ? Get the fuck outta here .

According to my calculations , you , uh , your expenditures are running about 2 1/2 times your income . Against how much of our own money we spend , is there ? Certainly not , as long as the collateral this was merely a courtesy on our part however , if the rate of spending continues , you have only , perhaps , a month and a half before your savings run out . And then we will have to talk . That wo n't be necessary , and could you do us a favor and not send any more of these letters ? My husband , he works very hard . He 's under a lot of pressure . He do n't need this aggravation . Really . Thank you . You said a month and a half , right ? She 's a beauty ! Wait a minute . Where are the singers ? Who needs '

Oh , hey , estelle , that new console that you guys got can I ask a personal-type question ? Where we gettin ' the money for all this ? You got ta admit , you 're spendin ' like there 's no tomorrow . Yeah , so what 's the worst that could happen ? How ' bout you lose all your savings ? You could n't open up the bar then . Aw , so ? Oh , estelle . Well , you have to rent it out and maybe even - - sell the house ? Bingo . ? She goes fro ? he goes fast ? she goes slow ? he goes left ? hmm , she goes right ? papa lookin '

A little gift . I got this at the amusement park . Aah ! Hey , what the hell ? What - - no , no , it 's fake . It 's for the kid . You brought that for my baby ? Yeah , well , what - - what 's the matter ? What are you up to ? Well , nothin ' , I just figured I 'd drop by and bring you a little gift . Just like that . Um , if you must know , me and the wife , we had a fight , and , well , it was nothin ' big , but I was just , uh , wandering ' around , so , that 's why you did this . You wanted a little place to come to whenever

" You all right now ? I 'm , uh - - yeah , listen , I 'm real sorry . I have n't done that since I was a - - a little kid , you know . Maybe even before that . I 've done a lot of it myself lately . Yeah , well , you 're a broad . You 're supposed to cry . I 'm sure things 'll get better for you . You heard of Julius larosa , right ? No . Julius larosa , that big singing star on Godfrey 's , uh , TV show . Used to be , anyway . I 've never had a television . No kidding . Well , that could 've been me . Yeah , that was my big shot . Godfrey saw me
zone2	said , " when you get out , you come and see me . " I told estelle . She said no . So you did n't do it ? I thought Italian men did whatever they pleased . Yeah , well , ever since then that 's been the way it goes , but - - you know , I never -- I never got that kind of break thrown my way again . You know , so I figured the least I could do if I 'm not a big singing star is I can be my own boss . So , I tell estelle . She says no . I go ahead , i do it anyway . It do n't work out . It has n't yet . Uh , ahem . I 'm gon na leave you alone . Um , I 'm - - you sure you 're all right ? Yeah , yeah . Whew ! Of course , yeah . I 'm gon na fix that window for you tomorrow .

Buddy : Mr . cicco seen the kid ? You tell me , all right ? I 'll take care of him . We both appreciate it , Mr . visalo . Yeah . So , has he got a name ? There was no birth certificate , so there was no need for a name . Well , jeez , if he does n't have a name , he 's not a real person legally . The same with a birth certificate . They do n't cost much money , you know . What does it matter ? Well , I mean , you said you did n't want to give him away . If that 's the case , then you ought to make him a legal person , that 's all . He 's not getting a name from me , Mr .
zone2	a minute . You 're gon na get rid of him ? What difference does it make to you ? Well , I do n't know . I mean , i - - i thought it was kind of brave keeping him . It showed some balls . Excuse me . I mean -- I do n't know . I was thinking maybe you and me , we kind of got something in common that way , you know . That 's all . Are you making a pass at me , Mr . visalo ? What ? Heh ! You make me laugh . No , no , I was n't making a pass at you . If I was making a pass at you , you 'd know I was making a pass at you . Do n't flatter yourself , huh ? I think you like your meat I think you should probably leave . Yeah , you know what ? I probably should . I mean , who are you ? Miss morals of 1956 ? What the hell ? Making a pass at you .
zone2	I 've been married 11 years . You 're the one who done that , not me . Christ ! Mr . visalo ! I 'm not used to people doing good by me . Ah , skip it . Look , uh , look , you need any money ? For food , I mean . My sister sent me some . That 's plenty . Mary : And 2 boxes of ... Ron-zani ? What kind ? What kind you got ? Macaroni , Linguini , capellini , fettuccine . Yes , thank you . Buddy : Hey , what do you think , huh ? Buddy 's tavern or buddy 's place ? Buddy 's tavern ? Narrator : That 's the first time I remember seeing buddy . How are you ? And a bottle of - - sh ... Chi ... Shanty . Chianti . Thank you . This is delicious . I do n't normally eat so much . Buddy : Yeah , I noticed . You got ta keep up your strength . Mmh . I ca n't cook like you . Actually
zone2	, I noticed that , too . When I was up in your house , I mean . I do n't know why Jim married me . Well , I mean I know why , but he was n't satisfied for long . Why 'd you marry him ? He was a friend of my father 's . When my father was dying , I asked him what I could do to make him happy . He told me to marry Jim , so I did . I was 14 . 14 ? Is there anything else you 'd like to know ? Yeah . My husband ... Had his own way of diverting himself from me . After a while , i suppose I needed a way for myself , and I do n't like to drink .

You almost got killed over that . Excuse me . I 'm gon na go to the men 's room . I mean , I thought i looked bad . Buddy , come on ! Where the fuck you been ? How long does it take to get nails ? Hey , I was - - whoa ! You 've been drinking ? I 'm fucking tanked , man . I was at Angelo 's all afternoon waiting for you . So , you 've been eating or something ? What ? Oh , just a snack . Look , where are the girls ? They 're in the back . Come on , man . Jesus . Hey , hey ! Look what the wind blew in ? Sorry I 'm late there . Hello . Hello . Hey . All right . I ordered you
zone2	. All the goodies that we got for you . It was half off on all the socks , the underwear . It was great . Underwear ? Lucky me , huh ? Wait 'll you see the flannel jackets we got you . Flannel jackets ? Oh , nice , nice . Who 's that ? He works at the bank . Oh , yeah ? What are you doing going to the bank ? Why ca n't I go to the bank ? Well , you got no reason to go to the bank . You do n't get a paycheck . Here , salute . Salute . I would n't want to intrude . Mr . brancaccio , this is my husband buddy . Hey , how are you ? I just wanted to apologize again . Do n't mention it . W-w-wait , what are you talking about ? Nothing , honey . Thank you . No , no , you were right , Mrs . visalo . There 's no law against the amount of money and it 's really none of our business .
zone2	the hell , huh , estelle ? I 'll tell you later . No , no , you tell me now . They sent a letter , the bank . They said we were overspending or something , i do n't know . So , I was passing by and went in , and I told them to mind their own business . Ok ? The bank sent you a letter ? To you . I opened it by mistake . So why did n't you tell me ? Because I did n't want you to worry . Excuse me . Come here , will you ? Mmph . Uh , tell me what 's going on . Buddy , what is the big deal ? It 's none of his business . Let him talk , all right ? What 's with this letter stuff ? I only wanted to help . Our letter upset your wife . We try to keep an eye on our first-time homeowners . Nothing . Our spending is outdoing our savings or something . I believe it was by 2 1/2 times .
zone2	, ok ? Why do n't you tell me that ? Just eat your dinner , and we 'll talk about it later , ok ? Listen , I got a right to know . After all , I 'm a homeowner . Oh , here we go . The big shot homeowner . Ok , so what did she say to you ? Mind his business , that you know what you 're doing , and that he should n't worry , ok ? Yeah , damn right . That 's right . Yeah , it 's none of your business . I know what I 'm doing . My apologies again . All right . Calm down . Can I have the cheese ? 2 1/2 times ! How come you do n't tell me something like that ? Because you 're the big shot homeowner . You ought to know . And you know what ? If you do n't , it serves you right . You do n't know nothing about owning a house or running some bar , ok ? You know , buddy ,
zone2	like it . You got ta have the brains for it . Oh , ok , so what are you saying ? I do n't go no brains ? Buddy , I was just trying to look out for you . I was trying to help you , buddy . I bought a house , right ? That 's got ta take some brains . Narrator : The argument was legendary , epic . I am stupid , and I 'm embarrassing . I 'm ignoring you . I 'm eating . I 'm ignoring you . Watch this . Watch this . I 'm ignoring you . What do you mean you did it for us ? We 're almost broke , and you do n't tell me about it ? I did n't want to see you fail again . Narrator : It went on far into the night , encompassing virtually every aspect of the 11-year union between buddy and estelle visalo . This is not our house . Why are you making us do this ? Was n't everything ok ? Do n't you want to
zone2	to do something with your life ? Like what , buddy ? Like what ? Serving drinks to a lot of bums , huh ? You want to turn me into a barmaid ? Is that what you want to do ? Jesus , estelle , we own our own business . We own our own home . I mean , Jesus , estelle , I mean , this is America . Where you living ? This is the point . Most women , they want their husbands you , you 'd be happy if we stayed back in - - back where we belong , buddy , not making fools of ourselves , not having everybody laugh behind our back . By who ? Who ? Your stupid friends ? My stupid friends ? Who the fuck cares , huh ? I got something they ai n't got . It 's a crime for me not to use what I got . What do you think you got that 's worth throwing away our futures on ? I 've got talent ! I could be somebody , baby !
zone2	answer to some creep bastard who 's got a sign that says " supervisor " on his desk . Buddy , your ideas , they do n't work . They have n't yet . But this time , they will . Why should they ? They never did before . Because I 'm gon na make it work , no matter what ! Narrator : " No matter what " meant buddy needed more money to spend at this present rate . So you see , it 's just not possible on the wage that you earn to make these expenditures . Yeah , but it 's just till the bar 's set up . Once it 's open , I 'll be in the dough . Like with the pizza store ? Brancaccio : At this rate , it does n't look like you 'll have enough to finish . Why do n't we just rent out the downstairs ? The bar 's half-built . So , then we only have half a bar to pull out . Perhaps you could postpone construction on the bar . Screw it
zone2	are you gon na sleep ? When the bar 's open . Are we done here ? Narrator : And so , as the working men looked forward to the happiest part a drink at the local bar with their friends , buddy prepared to pay the price for his future independence . Hey , one minute ! Come on , get that drill in there and joint it to the semi . You 'll get used to it . These day shift guys start to look like suckers waking up at dawn every morning . See , that 's the best part . We get to go to sleep at dawn . Dawn , yeah , yeah . You shift the shift into the sliding machine . Make sure it 's a smooth flow , and then turn it around , then get it up , and then bring it down again , but do n't you breathe it , because if you breathe it , it 's gon na get in your lungs , and then we 're gon na have to replace you , not to mention
zone2	, give it the button . Every minute , set , set , you set . Go ! Go , go , go , go , go ! Yeah ! You know who 's a grumbler ? My brother-in-law Pete . He does not appreciate a goddamn thing . Look around you . How beautiful this world is . You know , I do n't remember the last time I was awake at 3:30 in the morning . You know , I do n't remember when I was n't . Hey , how about a couple ... I know a place that stays open . Rain check , huh ? Ok , catch you later . See you tomorrow . Hey , Mary ? You must be tired . I got ta do what it takes . I figure she do n't want me to have my own bar , that 's fine with me . She 'll get used to it eventually . See , the trouble with estelle is she do n't like failure . But with her , it 's like a disease . I do n't
zone2	She takes great care of me and all . You do n't seem like the kind of man that needs taking care of . Yeah , well , this one ca n't go in the tank like all the others . It wo n't . We 're all meant for something particular . This is what you 're meant for . You think so , huh ? I know so , Mr . visalo . Hmm . I found an adoption agency for the baby . They said they do n't mind what he looks like . I guess they just must be starting out or something , huh ? It means I can stay with my sister . When ? A week . Maybe with the money you 'll save you wo n't have to work so hard . Yeah , I suppose so , but - - it means I can try and start over again like nothing ever happened . Now , why you gon na do that ? I mean , maybe you 're never gon na want to tell anyone what happened , but you
zone2	ca n't . I guess it 's a little easier that way , huh ? A lot easier . Well , in that case , if you and me were to spend some time together , you would just forget about it anyway , and you know me , I 'd never tell . I mean , it would be a lot easier , just like you said . Why - - why do you want me , Mr . visalo ? ' Cause I got a feeling about you I never felt before , not even with my wife . I mean , it 's not that I do n't love her , even though she pisses me off all the time . I do n't know . It 's just this feeling . I 've been a good husband 11 years . I figure one week would n't really matter . I 've been a bad girl my whole life . I do n't suppose a week would matter to me , either . ? I 'm confessin ' that I love you ? ? tell me ,
zone2	'm confessin ' that I need you ? ? honest I do ? need you every moment ? ? in your eyes I read such strange things ? ? much our lips deny they 're true ? ? will your answer really change things ... ? How you doing ? You all right ? You gon na make it ? Ha ha ha ! Narrator : 8:00 to 6:00 at the factory ... ? I 'm afraid some day you will leave me ? A half-hour for dinner ... ? Sayin ' " ca n't we still be friends ? " ? Then the night shift till 3 A.M . ? If you go , you know you will grieve me ? ? all in life on you depends ? 3 A.M . to 6 A.M . Was spent every night of that week with my mother Mary wiley o'neary , a kept woman . ? Dreaming dreams of you in vain ? ? well , I 'm confessin ' ? that I love you ? over again woman : My Harry 's been on the night shift for 2
zone2	They say that ai n't healthy , you know . That working all night , sleeping all day . How about sleeping 2 hours and then going back to work ? I swear to god , if he do n't quit , I 'm gon na make him . It 's bad for his health . It was worse before the unions . Then they made them work 6:00 to 6:00 . My Harry used to get home just in time for me to wake up , get dressed , and go to work . Back when i had to work . I would n't let chip work those hours . Unless he wanted to open up his own bar , huh ? Well , what happened after the unions ? Used to be 6:00 to 6:00 , now it 's 6 P.M . to 3 A.M . That 's why we voted for impastado . He made changes . That was the first time I ever voted . You ca n't live on those kind of hours . That he husband was simply not talented enough enterprising enough to
zone2	but a factory worker . She also never doubted his fidelity , his naive , blundering honesty . How was work ? Murder . That there might be the slightest hint of deception in her husband . At one point , she thought of how disappointing it might be if buddy were to simply go to an all-night diner and sit there until 6:00 . That would indicate that he simply preferred to be anywhere but with her . And those tomatoes - - not these , the strange one's . Sun-dried . Ok . Oh , and , uh , ricotta . Ricotta secca . You hurt yourself ? Oh , I 'm fine . This is a big bash , though . Do n't worry about it . Thank you . You live here ? Upstairs . How 's the baby ? He 's fine . Well , I just came by to see how you were doing . Working the night shift ? Eh , fuck ' em . I 'm going home . Good for you . Narrator : He was lying , of course .
zone2	hoping - - praying that he would come by early that night just to explain the presence of his wife in this strange neighborhood . Mary , I have this great idea for the bar . Every week , I 'm gon na have a cookout , and everybody 's gon na bring their own recipe , and we 'll do it like a contest . Your wife - - oh , she 's gon na love it , she 's gon na have to do all the cooking . She came by . She - - she came by here ? She said she wanted to see how I was doing . She 's standing there with a bag of groceries like the good little housewife . She was probably gon na cook for him . You mean the one with the colored baby ? Estelle : Yes , the one with the colored baby , and he spent the night with her , too . Oh ! It 's the worst i ever heard , and my Harry slept with some real skivates -- I do n't even
zone2	go back ? I already packed my stuff and moved back to my mother 's . Good . Good . Besides , there 's hardly anything left . Huh ? What do you mean ? I got a little crazy , ok ? Oh , Jesus , estelle , after all that work that you guys did . That 's right . After all that work so that he could go do the hokey-pokey with some putan who 'd sleep with a nigger and have a baby ! I mean , am I that disgusting ? No ! No ! Shh . No . No . Look , listen , listen . Men ... They got no sense about this stuff . Some of them , they 'll sleep with anything . I mean it - - kids , animals - - just as long as they got someone at home who do n't know about it . Listen , you guys , you ca n't say nothing . Promise me , teen , laur , please .

zone2	3331215 [Man_Narrating] My story begins when I was but a lad of 16 . It was the year I became a novice at Brother Gilbert 's monastery , when I first heard the prophecy : A dragon 's heart could do mankind ... when a two-tailed comet blazed across the night sky . I paid this leg end little heed , for I had come for a quiet life of prayer and devotion . Besides , everyone knew there were no more dragons . The last , Draco , had been slain by Sir Bowen , a knight of the old code . I later learned that in the last year of his life , Bowen returned to Draco 's cave . There he was granted a miracle , a dragon egg about to hatch . The dying knight entrusted the hatchling to our monastery . Fearful evil might dwell in this dragon 's heart , Friar Peter and the abbot pledged to hide him away ... until the comet had passed . For 20 years , they carefully guarded ... the secret locked beneath us . Eight days before the comet 's arrival , my quiet life was turned
zone2	'd be embroiled in deception , mystery and battle . And who could have known that [Geoff] , the orphan stable boy at our monastery , would reveal the deepest secret ... of what is truly in a dragon 's heart . [Man] Make way for the king 's noble knights . Wishing to be one of them ... wo n't get the stables cleaned any faster . Where do you think they 're headed all dressed up like that ? They 're off to the castle ... to honor Lord [Osric] being sworn in ... as the king 's chief advisor . The castle . [Bell_Tolling] I suggest you get back to the stable ... before the abbot catches you around . I promise I will have the stables scrubbed cleaner than the abbot 's table by vespers . And , Friar Peter , I will even clean that old dungeon for you , if you just unlock it for me . I 'll tell you a secret about that dungeon : There 's nothing down there ... that can transform you into a knight . You 're a
zone2	practice humility , you 'll be a fine stable master some day . I 'll be outta here long before I 'm any kind of stable master . [Man] I , Lord [Osric] of Crosley , choose the old code as my oath . I am hereby sworn to valor , to speak only the truth , to use arms to defend the helpless , to use might to uphold the weak . My heart knows only virtue . My wrath will undo the wicked . My king . As chief advisor , my goal is nothing less than ensuring that the old code ... lives on in the hearts and minds of all people . Everyone should share in our kingdom 's bounty . Tomorrow , I shall bestow a personal gift ... on all men , women and children in the land . A gift ? Is it my birthday ? No , Sire . [Narrator] Everyone was pleased when Lord [Osric] ... was named chief advisor ... since our beloved king 's behavior had become so ... unusual of late . Everyone will receive two new tunics
zone2	station . From now on , no one will wear anything else . [Narrator] There I was , so young , a mere novice entrusted with the monastery 's most important secret . Silence was my solemn vow . [Mansel] , what are you doing ? [Geoff] . Looks like old Friar Peter 's cauldron . What would you be doing with that ? Can you keep a secret ? You know I can . Friar Peter gave me a new chore to do . Ooh . Lucky you . What is it ? I told you , it 's a secret . Fine . A secret chore from Friar Peter . That 's pretty special . Do n't you think ? Maybe just a little special , yes . Do n't say it like that . Take some pride in being special . All right , I am special . It 's not like pride 's one of those seven deadly sins or anything . Actually , it is . [Pig_Squealing] You 're right , [Geoff] . Manual labor sure keeps the soul humble . - Thank you for
zone2	Do n't forget the corners . - [Knocking] - Yes ? Two most unusual strangers are asking after Brother Gilbert 's writings . The abbot has sent them to you . Very well . This is Master [Kwan] and his son . I fear I do n't have much hospitality to offer . Oh . I spent my youth in a monastery much like this one , but we do not seek comfort . We have come from Hebei Province , where man and dragons lived in peace . Many years ago , a terrible evil set dragon against man , and all our dragons were destroyed . A terrible tale . Though I have to say , I do n't see ... what this has to do with me . I 'm told that the founder of this monastery ... wrote extensively about dragons , and that you are the guardian of his scrolls . Brother Gilbert was a kind soul ... with a fanciful imagination and a poor hand at poetry . It has been read in the stars ... that a new dragon was born . Surely
zone2	eight days . We must prevent the evil from taking hold again . I am a man of God . I do not believe in such superstitious prattle . Then ... the dragon talon in your pocket ... is a meaningless talisman ? It has meaning only to the monks of this order . It was passed on by Brother Gilbert , who received it from Sir Bowen . He claimed it belonged to Draco , the last dragon . [Kwan] But we must test the dragon before the comet arrives . [Friar_Peter] There are no dragons here . But Lord [Osric] knows about stars and comets . Perhaps he can help you . [Kwan] Thank you . Good night . What would [Mansel] be doing down here ? Ah . This was not a good idea . [Screams] [Growling] Stay away from me ! [Growling] , Sniffing [Growling_Continues] You know , you-you 'd better - - You 'd better go . You 're not supposed to be here . How long have you been down here ? I 've always been here . - I 'm [Geoff] . -
zone2	Seven lashes to anyone caught without their tunic . Those men from the East are still waiting , Lord . Show them in . Please . [Kwan] Thank you for seeing us . Not at all . It 's an honor . We are on a quest related to the arrival of the two-tailed comet . Well , you do n't have much time . According to my star charts and calculations , the comet will return one week from today . What do you hope to accomplish ? We seek the dragon of the prophecy . Hmm . A noble though nonsensical mission , since nothing is left of dragons but their legend . - Respectfully . I saw a dragon 's claw just last night . - Did you ? Friar Peter claimed it belong ed to Draco himself , but can we be sure ? All this talk of dragons and prophecies ... will frighten the common people . They 're terrified of dragons , with good reason . For your own safety , you should leave this kingdom tonight . Stefan , see them safely to
zone2	[Geoff] visited the dungeon ... every chance he got . I suspect he hoped that knowing [Drake] ... would somehow lead to adventure and fame . [Geoff] must have been sorely disappointed to learn he had befriended a dragon ... who had no idea how to fly or breathe fire . Oh , come on , [Geoff] . Your tunic does n't look that bad . I hate this thing . Itches and it 's the color of worm vomit . That 's not the color of my vomit . The old code does n't say anything ... about what you 've got to wear to become a knight . Well , I 've got about as much chance of becoming a knight ... as I do of convincing you to come outside . Friar Peter made me promise that I would never go outside . You 're a dragon . Act like one . Hey . Here . Allow me . It 's Friar Peter . Oh , no . Oh , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . He ca n't
zone2	? I have sad news . M-Mansel ? What ? What is it ? Friar Peter is gone . Where did he go ? He went to heaven . Do you know what that means ? Oh , yes . Did it hurt him to die ? I do n't think so . He seemed fine yesterday , but he was old . This morning he just did n't wake up . He was very fond of you , you know . I know I am not Friar Peter , but I will do my best to take care of you . I promise . Thank you , [Mansel] . [Groaning] I was just talkin ' to him . I ca n't believe he -- I do n't feel like talking now . I 'd like to be alone . [Whinnies] It 's that stable boy from the monastery . [Man] Oh , let 's pay him a visit . Up . Up . Up . [Whinnies] Whoa . Hi . I saw you yesterday . I 'm sorry I did n't stop to meet you . I 'm Roland
zone2	castle ? [Geoff] . Old and stuffy , but you know how it is . - Well , I hardly ever go there anymore . - You 've got a sword . You want to try your hand with us ? Sure . [Man_Chuckles] The stable boy 's not bad . We 're just practicing . [Screams] [Men_Laughing] If we were n't practicing , you 'd be dead , stable boy . Now , lower your eyes . Peasants should never meet the gaze of their betters . MenMurmuring , Laughing - So , this is what it 's like outside . - [Drake] ! You had to come out here now , did n't you ? I never got to say good-bye to Friar Peter . He was the only one who knew about dragons . You 're lucky to have had him as long as you did . But my heart hurts . You wo n't feel this bad forever . [Indistinct_Chattering] Today I make two edicts in accordance with the old code . To defend our helpless and uphold our weak , those people wearing green ,
zone2	after sunset . Time for your evening tonic , sire . And from this day forward , only the words of truth will be spoken in our kingdom . [Applause] Who does [Osric] think he is ? Next thing you know , he 's gon na be telling people what to think . If they wan na let him do that , he probably can . Well , not me . You 're throwing your tunic away ? I do n't think that 's a very good idea . - Let 's fly away from here . - But I do n't wan na fly . Of course you want to fly . What do you think those wings of yours are for ? Hmm . You see those mountains ? Beyond those are-are other kinds of people ... and treasure and adventure and glory . [Geoff] , Indistinct Hmm ? [Kwan] So he lives . The stars did n't lie . [Man] Those foreigners had to come back this way . They ca n't be far . Let 's split up . [Man] This way ! GeoffShouting , Indistinct
zone2	not allow sentiment to interfere with our mission . That boy was at the monastery . And then we could come back and be more famous than Bowen and Draco . [Growling] All you have to do is just open your wings and jump . I 'm not going anywhere . I 'm staying right here . I like it here . If it 's so easy , you show me how to do it . It would have been better for everybody ... if I was the dragon and you were the stable boy . Go ahead . I 'd like to see that . Stupid dragon . Oops . He 's got no tunic . Let me read your minds . You wan na know why I 'm not wearing my tunic . Yeah . Well , let me tell you ... [Continues] , Indistinct - The boy can take us to the dragon . - It 's a funny story , actually . You see , today was the day when ... all the monks clean the privies . [Man] What 's he take us for ?
zone2	... was a rag or something , because he used it to wipe up -- Seven lashes for the tunic ... and ten for the lie . [Men_Murmuring_In_Agreement] We seem to have lost our way . Perhaps you can point us in the proper direction ? Lord [Osric] told you to get out of town . Now , the only direction I 'll show you is toward the castle dungeon . Take him ! Be gentle with them . [Grunting] [Both_Grunting] [Man] Come on ! [Screaming] You 're a girl ? I 'm [Kwan] . This is [Lian] . [Men_Yelling] We should leave this area . This way ! Get him ! [Drake] ! [Drake] ! I 'm being followed . You got ta hide . If the guards see us , we 're dead . Dead ? Dead ? I do n't wan na die . What 's happening to you ? Oh , my . [Groans] After him ! [Whinnies] [Grunts] Hello again . Nice day to run the horses , huh ? Where are the foreigners ? I do n't know . They disappeared . No one
zone2	right . I give up . Take me to the dungeon now . You 're not getting off that easy . [Screaming] [Roaring] [Screaming] I 've got you . It 's all right . [Drake] , you 're flying . Of course we 're flying . How do you think we got way up here ? Ah , this is great . Let 's go up higher . Hey ! Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Okay . Let 's swoop down and scare the villagers . Oh , no . This is dangerous enough as it is . Do n't sound so scared . You 've done the hard part already . Actually , I think the hard part is g oing to be getting down ! Everybody , look out ! Next thing I know , three Teregoths , just me . What 's that up there ? [Woman_#1] Look at that . [Woman_#2] A dragon ! [Gasping] [Geoff] , any ideas , because I 'm g etting tired ? [Indistinct_Chatter] Lean right . Lean right . No , left . Whoa ! You

First Friar Peter 's sudden passing , and now this . It 's all my fault , Father . [Osric] Faster , men . Faster . [Groans] Would you loosen up ? I can hardly breathe . " Lean farther . Fly faster . Hold looser . " - I ca n't think of so many things at once . - J ust slow down , will you ? [Screaming] [Geoff] I think that was a little bit too slow . [Coughing] [Growling] We made it . You were great . Great ? Even though we crashed ? Absolutely ! You are a natural . Thanks . Uh-oh . [Men_Yelling] Who 's smart idea was it to scare ' em ? Uh , uh , uh , start flapping . Start flapping ! I ca n't flap anymore . I 'm exhausted . [Angry_Shouting] [Growling] Watch out . That

Uh , he went that way . - Hold him ! - [Man] He 's in there . Put those down ! [Geoff] You heard him . Put those down ! [Peasants_Murmuring] Ca n't you see this is , uh -- Lord [Osric] , chief advisor to the king , at your service , [Growling] good drag on . He 's a bit shy . His name is [Drake] . I'm-- I mean , we-we are all so glad to see you , [Drake] . And your friend here ? - [Geoff] . - An honor to make your acquaintance . When the king saw your magnificent form flying overhead , he requested a favor of service from you . - Me ? - Indeed . He wishes to appoint you protector of the realm . [Geoff] here will be adjunct protector of the realm . Is that anything like a knight
zone2	see , I was right , milord . You two again ? I thought you 'd be intelligent enough to heed my advice and leave our kingdom . - Guards . - No ! These are my friends . [Drake_Growls] These people are from far away . See how different they are ? [Growls] They do not follow the old code . Do not trust them . He is right . We should go home . [Gasps] [Mansel] . [Growling] [Woman] Oh , he 's moving ! [Man] Stand back . Well , if-if they 're friends of [Geoff] 's , they 're friends of mine . [Man] He speaks ! Well , then , they 're welcome , of course , for as long as you want them to stay . The dragon will be an enormous help in protecting our kingdom . Nice of him to fly by when he did . His arrival was fate , not courtesy , Sire . With his help , we can vanquish the Teregoths once and for all . dd Bagpipes , OutOfTune I need you to give me command of
zone2	'll interpret that as your royal approval . [Mansel] You have no idea what you 've done . Of course I do . I got [Drake] out of that prison that you and Friar Peter locked him in ... and I taught him to fly , and I got myself out of the stables . Only four more days . All I had to do was keep [Drake] safe . Then he would have been free to live his life , but you -- Safe from what ? What 's gon na happen in four days ? A prophecy that says an ancient evil ... will take hold of this land using a dragon 's heart . Ancient evil ? [Drake] ? You got the wrong dragon . He does n't have to be evil for evil to use him . [Drake] is an innocent . He 's easily misled . Do n't worry . I 'll protect him . Who 's going to protect him from you ? [Sighs] Excuse me , miss . Put those back . This is a monastery . We do n't allow girls .
zone2	, [Mansel] ! You knew about her , did n't you ? Shame on you , [Mansel] . Do n't you remember the abbot 's sermon about that old tradition , sanitary ? - Sanctuary . - Yeah . Well , we should show her some sanctuary . You 're a monk , [Mansel] . That 's what monks do . All right . All right . - Do n't worry . He 'll keep your secret . - Thank you . I 'm glad you 're movin ' in . The food is lousy , but the place more than makes up for that with its lack of excitement . You want help with those ? I can handle them . I 've never seen anyone fight like you . Do n't touch the ramhead ! Bad luck . Oh . I 've never seen anyone fight like you . Where 'd you learn to do that ? Master [Kwan] taught me . Do all girls fight where you come from ? Do you like wearing girl 's clothes , or is that why you 're dressed like a
zone2	's the boy who found the dragon . Is n't he just a stable boy ? Hey , [Mansel] , have you seen [Drake] ? All right . I 'll keep looking . Hey , you have fun , ' cause it 's not like gluttony is on that seven deadly sin list too . If it is n't that fencing stable boy at the castle at last . Well , your tunic does n't seem so great now , does it ? You only have that tunic because you 're friends with the dragon . Without him , you are still a peasant . Roland , [Geoff] 's well on his way to becoming a knight . Is n't that true , Roland ? And what do you get if you do n't tell the truth in our kingdom ? Ten lashes . One more word and I 'll have to double that . Come with me . You 've handled swords before . None like this . Then , shall we ? En garde . [Narrator] As the time grew near for [Kwan] and [Lian] ... to test
zone2	of what they might have to do ... weighed heavily upon them . A shot through the heart with this poison ... will kill him fast and clean . If he fails , he will feel no pain . Unlike all the dragon my great grandfather murdered . If you allow your misplaced guilt to affect you at the pivotal moment , you will doom us all , child . - Would you prefer if I -- - No . This is my burden . I will do what I must . I just pray that [Drake] passes this test . You have natural talent . You deserve special attention , my boy . Perhaps you 'd consider taking rooms here at the castle . Me live here ? That way , I could tutor you personally . Where can my guards collect [Drake] 's belongings ? [Drake] 's ? I assumed you and him were a team . Well , I think he 'd be too scared to leave the monastery . Poor creature . We would n't want to make him uncomfortable . I 'm sure you can
zone2	he 'd like that a lot . What do you think it would take for a stable boy to become a knight ? Now come at me faster . The most fundamental attribute of a knight is his commitment ! He should want it more than anything else . More than wealth . More than adventure ! [Exhales] More than friendship . Do you want it that bad ? Yes , I do . You 'll make a positively heroic knight . It 's written ... in the stars . [Growling] This is what I wanted you to see . It is a ritual mask based on the most famous dragon in the East . But it ... looks so angry . [Kwan] This amulet ... has been imbued with all the wisdom of the ancient dragons . If you do as I say , you will receive all that knowledge in an instant . [Drake] I 've always dreamed of learning about dragons , but how can I possibly learn so much all at once ? [Kwan] You must open your most vulnerable spot , your heart , to
zone2	and the wisdom will be yours . [Drake] Open up my heart ? Oh , you mean ... like ... like this ? Just touch the amulet . [Drake] ! Is n't there another way for me to learn ? I-I could teach you , but that would take years . I do n't want to touch that thing . It 's evil . [Sighs] [Gasps] What are you doin ' to my dragon ? Nothing . Everything is all right now . That is most inappropriate . [Man] Get your dragon portraits ! Chattering , Laughing [Drake] ! [Kwan] said you passed some kind of test , so he 's gon na teach you all the old dragon secrets . And I 've got [Osric] practically begging me to learn how to be a knight . Is n't it great ? Look what I brought you from [Osric] 's library . [Drake] What ? Books about dragons and knights . I do not trust him , nor do I trust this [Osric] . The danger is still great . We must stay close to the dragon until the comet
zone2	, through the grate in my room . They always made me feel better somehow . Those are the stars of the constellation Draco , the souls of your ancestors . [Drake] Tell me more . [Kwan] A long time ago , dragons ruled the earth . When people appeared , drag ons saw their potential for good ... and shared their dragon wisdom , pledging to watch over humans and help them grow . The souls of dragons ... who fulfilled that pledge became stars . Their spirits are still up there ... comforting anyone who cares to look . Like a dragon heaven . [Kwan] Exactly . The last soul to join was a mighty drag on ... who shared his heart with a prince ... who was wounded in battle . While the dragon lived , the prince was invincible , sharing the dragon 's strength ... Really ? and his every pain . Oh . [Kwan] A dragon must be very cautious ... before sharing his heart . If the human 's heart is a corrupt one , the dragon can lose his place in heaven
zone2	[Drake] , look at this . [Drake] Why is that dragon chewing on a cow ? Looks like dinner to me . [Drake] Dinner ? Hmm . Come along , girl . [Cow_Mooing] Where 'd you go ? [Moans] My cow . [Lian_Yells] [Lian_Laughing] Not bad for your first lesson . Now attack me again . When exactly do I get to throw you ? [Dog_Barking] [Geoff] ! Sorry I 'm late . [Burps] - Excuse me . - Oh . Cow breath . - [Drake] What are you gon na teach me first , Master [Kwan] ? - Teach him to blow fire now . No , breathing fire is dangerous . [Groans] Stop being such a monk , [Mansel] . How does he breathe fire ? [Kwan] First , you must learn to open your fire lung . Inhale through your nose ... and concentrate on passing the air deep in your throat . Fill your lungs . It will sound like this . [Snoring_Sound] You try . Something 's wrong . Get down . Turn that way so you do n't hit the mill , then let
zone2	him protector of the realm , but he destroyed my mill ! He ca n't go ' round plucking up cows and flying off with them . [Osric] I can see you 're both very distressed . I 'm glad you came directly to me about this . Fix your mill . Buy yourself a new cow , and remember : our dragon is the last of a magnificent race . He deserves our utmost respect . Hmm ? Dragon lover . Peasants . Pay them no bother , lad . Small minds see what they wish and require guidance to understand the truth . Now , let us go outside and see [Drake] ... so you can both tell me what really happened at the mill , hmm ? [Drake] did n't want to come . He 's too embarrassed . [Kwan] tried to teach him how to blow fire , but it came out the other end . You left him with [Kwan] . And what else does the old man plan on teaching [Drake] ? I do n't know exactly . Something about all the wisdom of
zone2	man to me at once . Yes , my Lord . It shall be done . [Drake] No . No , no . This ca n't be right . All these knights are-are hurting dragons . [Geoff] [Drake] ! Sorry I did n't come home last night , but look what [Osric] gave me . W-Were n't we supposed to go flying this morning ? Well , [Osric] has a lot to teach me if I 'm gon na become a knight . We 'll fly tomorrow . [Drake] [Geoff] , you do n't plan to be like the knights in this book , do you ? Sure . Just like them . Come on . [Kwan] and [Lian] are gon na teach you something new today . Is there something wrong with the air up here ? Well , if Friar Peter had ever let you open your shutters in the winter , you 'd know . - It 's fog . - Friar Peter did n't want him to catch cold . We should go back to the monastery before [Drake] gets sick . Breathing ice is an

Well , then why did n't he say so ? Like this , [Drake] . - Ah . - That 's very good . Sputum expelled with air from your ice lung will come out frozen . - Sounds simple to me . - You do n't even have an ice lung . I do n't have wings , but I figured out how to land . I will not stand by and let you berate him like that . What are you gon na do , [Mansel] ? Whip me with your tassel ? - [Drake] I ca n't make spit . - Just suck on your tongue , but do n't swallow . Oh , come on ! You did that on purpose ! [Drake] I got some spit in my mouth . Open your ice lung and blow ! - [Mansel] , duck
zone2	killed him . [Mansel] ? Are you all right ? I 'm going back to the monastery before I catch my death . Here . Take my coat . Thank you . Got to get my anger under control , or something bad 's going to happen . [Groans] [Groaning_Continues] You 're coming with us , old man . [Lian] [Drake] is pretty disappointed . [Geoff] He should n't be . Did n't [Kwan] say that most dragons ca n't breathe ice ? [Geoff] . [Geoff] , he is disappointed in you . In me ? Why , ' cause I did n't go flying with him this morning ? I have more important things to do if I 'm gon na be -- Do n't you know what a miracle it is [Drake] even exists ? Years ago , a dragon named [Griffin] ... led a rebellion against our imperial city . When virtuous dragons captured [Griffin] , they took his heart as punishment and placed it in here . This is the withered heart of the betrayer of the dragon pledge . [Geoff] That 's a dragon 's
zone2	Emperor Kuo-fan ... as proof that the evil had been destroyed . But by then , the emperor was too fearful . He killed every dragon in the East . [Drake] is the last of his kind . He is more alone than you could possibly imagine . [Man] Now watch again closely . Toss smooth and easy . Like this . Now try it again , Sire . Better every day , Sire . [Chuckles] - Now open wide . - My Lord . [Osric] Ah , Master [Kwan] . How nice of you to visit . If you could just stay there for a moment , I have some vital affairs to discuss with the king . That 's enough of your dalliance for tonight . Now put your official seal on this . What is this ? An order of succession , Sire , granting me your lands and powers in the unlikely event of your premature death . Oh , is that all ? Now off to bed with you . Good night , [Osric] . Sleep well , my King . Tomorrow 's an important
zone2	will end . Oh , yes , Master [Kwan] ! Stefan , how could you be so rude ? Take that old sack off our honored guest 's head . I guess you were n't expecting me . My mistake . I 'll take care of it . Ah . You 've served me loyally for many years . Is that not right , Stefan ? Yes , sir . And in all that time , have you ever made a mistake before ? No , my Lord . [Osric] Watch closely , monk . [Stefan_Moaning] I wo n't tell . I swear by the Holy Rood I wo n't say a thing . That 's right . Just like your king . You wo n't say a single coherent thing . Now off to the dungeon with you like a good , little monk . It 's hot in here . You are all incompetents ! I must do this myself . Take the guards to the monastery for [Kwan] . I 'll meet you there with my knights . Tonight will bring an end to our deceptions .
zone2	here . Morning . New trouble approaches . [Horses_Whinnying] [Man] All of us for one old man and a boy ? The old man and his son are coming with us . This has to be some kind of a mistake . I 'll go talk to [Osric] . - You 're not in charge here , squire . - We shall be gone tomorrow . You 'll be gone now ! [Yelling] [Chuckles] [Yells] I might have known you 'd end up with the rest of the swillage , stable boy . - Go to the cart . Pull the ram 's head . - [Yelling_Continues] [Man] Regroup ! Regroup ! [Yelling] - [Whinnying] - Stop this at once ! Told you it was a mistake . There is no mistake . Until the comet is passed , [Kwan] and his ward will be my guests at the castle . No . We must stay with [Drake] . But I thought you said - - [Osric] [Geoff] . These people are not like you and me . What do we really know of their intentions ? This is in
zone2	All right . Um-hmm . [Man] Come on . Let 's go . You too . Now , where is [Drake] ? It 's time for him to assume his responsibilities as protector of the realm . The Tereg oths have attacked our border house . All the knights of the realm ... are needed . [Yelling] [Osric] Onward , men ! To defend the country and the old code ! Come on , you ! I 'm hot . Does the abbot know how hot it is down here ? Probably does n't care . Old bully never lets anyone do what they want . Well , I 'll talk as loud as I can ! Shh . Got to be quiet all the time . [Cackling] [Yells] I know you . Did you know your son is a girl ? They do n't allow girls in the monastery . But I wo n't tell if you do n't . I like girls . Hmm . [Growls] [Geoff] , I do n't like the looks of this . This is exactly the kind of adventure we 've been talking
zone2	Do n't let me down . [Osric] [Drake] , stay here and guard our backs . Be careful , [Geoff] . Follow me . Stay close . The Tereg oths killed our border guards . Quiet . Something 's wrong . Ambush ! [Yelling] [Geoff] ! No ! [Yelling_Continues] [Screaming] Excellent job . [Horse_Whinnying] [Geoff] ! Look out ! No ! [Breathing_Heavily] [Geoff] , tell [Drake] to give me his heart . [Growling] How bad is he hurt ? You 've got to share your heart with him . Are you sure ? - Hurry . He 's dying . - He saved your life . I 'll try . [Growling] Wait ! Stop ! - What ? - Something 's wrong . He 's not really hurt . He set us up . - [Grunts] - [Osric] Grab him ! - I would have knighted you tonight . - [Drake] Let him go ! But there 's no valor in you , stable boy . [Drake] No ! No ! Do n't hurt him ! Give me your heart , or he dies . - [Yelling] - [Drake] Come

By all the stars in heaven , I will have that heart tonight ! dd [Humming] [Burps] dd [Humming_Continues] Who are you ? How did you get in here ? I just woke up and was here . Where 's the monk and the boy and the old man ? Shh . Uh , who ? [Man] Come here ! Put your hands through the bars . [Chuckles] Come on . They need us at the front gate . [Mansel] ! Hello ? [Chuckles] Do you have the ingredients to brew an antidote ? Yes . Black lotus . He must have been to the Orient . You were right not to trust [Osric] ... and the boy . Though it was insolent of me to point it out so boldly , Highness . You have n't called me that in a long time , Master [Kwan] . Oh , you will grow accustomed to it

This is a new potion , Highness . It will clear your head . [Man_#1] Surround ' em ! [Man_#2] Take this side . You came here looking for the dragon and found him . Now , I must find him , and time grows short . Where is he ? I have been your honored guest all day . How could I possibly know ? A girl . - You look familiar . - Perhaps you met one of my relative ... while you were gathering herbs to poison your king . The amulet of the Chinese emperor , Kuo-fan . [Kwan] I understand now . - So , it is you ! - Who , Master [Kwan] ? In the flesh . Throw the amulet in the fire ! [Yelling] I thought this was destroyed . Daughter of the house of Kuo-fan . On the night of my destiny
zone2	No ! [Gasps] I have ... failed you . [Kwan] , now shh . You are my loyal servant , my wise master ... and my closest friend . [Sniffling] [Geoff] Hurry , [Drake] ! The prodigal dragon returns . You 'll be pleased to know you can keep your heart ... as the little empress here was kind enough to provide me with this . Murderer ! He killed Master [Kwan] , and he 's about -- Silence ! Kuo-fan was the murderer , as was Bowen ! Bowen was a knight of the old code . I 've shown you the true meaning of the old code . It 's a way to control people weaker than you ! No , Bowen 's real legacy was written in the blood of dragons . But one solitary dragon ... escaped Bowen 's wrath and fled to the East , a dragon who learned that the pledge to serve mankind ... was nothing more than a cruel joke ! Oh , oh , he sought his revenge , but in the end , his heart too was ... plundered ,

[People_Gasping] [Heart_Beating] - [Rumbling] - The heart of the prophecy was never [Drake] 's . It was [Griffin] 's . [Drake] , child . Come . There 's another dragon ? [Griffin] Little brother , we must teach mankind their place as our servants . Come to me , and we 'll fulfill the comet 's prophecy together . Y-You called me brother . [Griffin] Come . I 'll teach you what it really means to be a dragon . - [Drake] , do n't go ! - That 's it , brother ! [Geoff] , I 'm not alone . [Drake] , listen to me ! I know that I hurt you , and I 'm sorry , but he 's going to enslave mankind forever . Get out of [Drake] 's way ! [Geoff] ! [Drake] [Geoff] ! If it was n't for [Geoff] , I would 've given you my heart ... and lost my soul . He 's my real brother ! Poor

I offer my heart ... to make you whole , [Drake] To make you whole , [Both] its strength to purify your weakness . [Breathing_Deeply] [Gasps] [Geoff] . What happened ? My heart hurts . You mean our heart hurts , but it wo n't feel this bad forever . [Narrator] And so , evil was vanquished , and the old code restored . [Lian] returned to her royal duties for a time , while I came home to the monastery ... and was awarded guardianship of Brother Gilbert 's scrolls . A life of prayer and devotion was mine at last , but it was a great deal quieter than I remembered . As for [Geoff] and [Drake] , they finally had what they 'd really wanted from the start : a brother , a family . See the sun 's last glimmering ray Fading fast

zone2	4288799 ' If a film crew ventured back 65 million years , ' they would be among dinosaurs in their natural habitat . ' They could bring back unique images of a time ' when reptiles ruled on Earth . ' Images we thought we 'd never see . ' This is what the makers ' of the TV series " Walking With Dinosaurs " wanted to achieve . ' A portrait of a lost world - as it really was . ( Roar ) Lovely , thank you . Except just one thing . Sorry , but the chicks were n't ready . If you could go back , we 'll have you ... The aim is to bring dinosaurs alive . To get a feeling of what it was like . These creatures wandered the Earth and they were huge and fearsome , nothing like we 've got today . So it was a terribly exciting time . ' This series could only be made ' by bringing the dinosaurs back to life , ' together with the world they lived in . ' The problem being that dinosaurs today ' are very dead indeed . ' I
zone2	suppose it 's a skull . ' They quit this Earth ' leaving only faint traces of their existence . It 's that bone that goes behind the ear , it holds part of where the lower jaw articulates . We know what it is ! ' Fortunately , palaeontologists have spent 150 years ' trying to reveal the behaviour behind the bones . ' Peter Larson is one of them . ' He 's digging up a T-Rex . ' When palaeontologists started working on these animals , they were fitting the bones together and trying to classify them . Today , we 're looking more at behaviour , to reconstruct what these animals were like when they were alive . Each bone tells a story . We look at how the bones fit together . The animal 's mechanics tell us about behaviour as well . And looking at everything else found with this fossil , we find other bones , bones of other T-Rexes or their prey . Everything gives us a little more indication of their behaviour . ' Palaeontology would guide every stage ' of
zone2	the first step - building the animals . ' It was not the first time people have tried ' to physically reconstruct dinosaurs , ' but there are lessons to be learned from those who tried before . ' This is Crystal Palace Park in London . ' The statues are a reminder of past mistakes . ' Last century , there was hardly anything to go on - a few bones and teeth . From that , they built complete animals . So it 's not surprising they made mistakes . The head 's the wrong shape , we know that now . In particular , there 's this great big horn , very similar to a rhinoceros . It 's completely wrong . We now know that horn is a thumb spike which was used to defend the animal . 0ver time , ideas change , and more dinosaur skeletons were found , more complete , and ideas about the shape of dinosaurs evolved . ' By the 1920s , dinosaurs looked a bit more like this . ' At the time , such pictures were an amazing
zone2	. ' The Brontosaurus should n't bend its neck . ' The T-Rex should not stand up straight . ' Since then , a lot more skeletons have been discovered ' and as a result , museum pieces have become increasingly accurate . ' Making dinosaurs true to how they were ' meant using up-to-date skeletons . ' Sculptors then built the whole animal from the bones up . ' The basic shape of the dinosaurs reconstructed today is pretty much correct . Science has progressed enough to get the basic shape as accurate as we hoped . ' Far more than the basic shape was needed . ' The creatures needed skin , colour , eyes ... everything . ' Could a pile of bones reveal that ? ' Bones give a starting point . Take the skull of Iguanodon . With this animal , the bones give you more clues about the way you might flesh out this framework . The jaw has this distinctive prong . Markings on that show where muscles attach and how it works . So you can flesh in the skull there .
zone2	A rough surface with lots of openings for blood vessels . This shows exactly where there was a horny beak growing . If you 're lucky , you can find skin impressions . This is Iguanodon . Notice the scales , just like a lizard . The skin itself was quite flexible . ' 0ne thing , though , could only be guessed at . ' Colour is something we 're very unlikely to find . We do n't know of any pigments preserved in dinosaur skeletons . It 's reasonable to suspect that many dinosaurs were colourful and used colour in aspects of their behaviour . So there 's no harm in introducing colour . With information from other fleshy structures , you can put together a picture of the dinosaur as it might have appeared . ' 0nce the animals were built , ' the next step was to find somewhere for them to live . ' ( Squawks ) When we 're digging dinosaur bones , we 're also interested in their habitat and environment , so we collect other things as we 're working . 0ne
zone2	is still buried in the rock but at the lab , we 'll uncover it and get a good identification of it . Some of the fossil plants we find are identifiable right away . This sequoia cone , for instance , you can tell what it is . As well as sequoias , which are redwoods , we find monkey puzzle trees here . This tells us it was much warmer , it did n't freeze at night . In winter , we get down to 50 below , but it did n't do that 65 million years ago . ' So that 's what was needed , ' places where dinosaurs would feel at home . ' These days , they 're hard to find . ' It was a complete nightmare finding locations . For one reason - grass . Grass never appeared in dinosaur times , yet it 's all over this world . Even when we find wonderful trees , there 's always grass amongst them . When you want some clear area , there 's grass . ' There are still places where the
zone2	the film crew travelled far and wide ' to locations that reflect the world ' in the time of dinosaurs . ' The Triassic of 220 million years ago ' was discovered in eerie New Caledonia . ' A land of Jurassic giants was found ' in the redwood forests of California . ' And the lava fields of Chile ' were a match for the Cretaceous of 65 million years ago . ' We 're filming a mother Tyrannosaurus feeding her young . Tyrannosaurus was only around for the last two million years . And to film it , we 've come to this place in Chile , and there 's an ideal forest . There 's a low , scrubby southern beech - that came along at the end of the time of dinosaurs . Behind it is this monkey puzzle forest . Monkey puzzles have been around since before the dinosaurs so the combination is ideal . It 's on an old ash field , and there 's no grass here , so it all fits together to be the right background . - Can you reach
zone2	, um ... ' Accompanying the trips was an assortment of animatronics . ' This is a baby Tyrannosaurus puppet ' with remote control nostrils . ' Squeeze , then do the nostrils . 0K , in you come , Andy . A bit reluctant . Come closer . Sniff . Back off a bit , now come in again . ' They were used for all the close-up shots . ' The larger head represents the mother . ' Down , down - push . And out again . Let 's try that one more time . Cut a minute . Be more positive , keep that lower jaw still , Joe . And then try and be more positive . Come in with a firm movement and shove . - Ready ? Everyone set ? - Yeah . - We turning ? - Running . In you come , Andy . You have a look , sniff the air a bit and then you look up and you back off ... Good . That 's nice - and pull it out . ' The animatronics were only bit
zone2	to come to life . ' That would be next . ' Will you please stand still ! We 've got a huge task ahead . These creatures have n't walked for 60 million years . We have to bring them back so everybody believes they are walking with the dinosaurs . ' The sculptures would take on new life inside the computer . ' They had to be scanned by a laser ' which probed every nook and cranny ' to transfer the physical models to virtual one's . ' ' They would have to be taught to walk , run and swim . ' And some would even have to fly . ' In fact , a pterosaur was an unbelievable animal . ' How should it fly ? ' How would a reptile with a 12-metre wingspan , ' even get off the ground ? ' This was one of many questions palaeontologists had to answer . How could an animal this size fly ? It looks so massive , but this massive head here weighed very little indeed . The whole animal only weighed a few
zone2	the way the bones were engineered . The skeleton is exceedingly lightly constructed . The hollow bones are probably filled with air sacs and engineered in such a way that they would resist twisting and buffeting by the wind . So the whole skeleton was exceedingly light , but exceedingly strong . This meant that they were incredible flyers . The palaeontologists arrived en masse and told us what they knew about dinosaur movement , about bone lengths , about limits of motion of the skeleton . If you put the scapula onto the forearm and articulate it , the lengths are almost equal , and it opens the door . They can tell us , this dinosaur did not move its neck higher than 20 degrees . From there , it can come right round down here ... They can tell us , this animal did not run , because it would break its limbs . They 'll tend to move in a slightly ponderous way , not whizz off ... But it 's all up to the animators because there 's a lot they ca n't tell .
zone2	I think you just solved the problem . ' And so all this expertise ' was slowly put into practice ' as the characters were animated , limb by limb . ' The pterosaur was soon flying , ' tentatively at first , ' but it would soon get the hang of it . ' 0thers turned out to be more difficult . ' Animating Tyrannosaurus is tricky , because he 's basically a five-tonne bird , really . I 'm trying to get the weight into his feet , squashing and stretching to make him look heavy . This is tricky , with flippers . Nothing today swims this way , so we have to devise a system . 0ne problem with the Steg , and most dinosaurs is their long back legs . We ca n't have the little front legs shuffling along , so I 'm working on that . Diplodocus is really hard to animate because it 's so big . You can see , the tail is absolutely massive , and the neck is as well . It 's gon na be hard to get
zone2	alive today and no creatures alive today move in the same way the dinosaurs did . That skeletal structure is n't around any more . The first thing we 're going to do is look at real wild animals today . How does their way of life affect the way they move ? How does their body affect their movement ? Then we 'll look at the dinosaurs and try and make the same guesses . It 's a sort of primitive form of motion capture , really . ' For the movement of Diplodocus , ' Mike Milne 's team of animators looked at elephants . ' With them was palaeontologist and sauropod expert Kent Stevens . ' I 'm surprised how little lateral movement there is , I 'd expected more . The gait might be similar . I have a problem with the fluidity of the movement . Because it 's smaller ? No , because this is a more intelligent creature . A sauropod may be five times heavier , but their brain is the size of my fist . I do n't see the neural
zone2	So we can take the movement of the limbs but not necessarily the speed and fluidity ? It 's important to see how the weight is pulled back . When she stops , she locks her knees and the legs are very columnar , and that weight distribution stuff I could imagine . ' Armed with this knowledge , ' the animators got the Diplodocus moving . ' 0ne key thing in the finished animation ' is there are always three feet on the ground ' to distribute the giant 's weight . 0thers were more stubborn . ' Getting the pterosaurs to fly had been relatively straightforward . ' Making them walk was a puzzle . ' This , surprisingly , is a pterosaur . 0n the ground , its wings have to bend round so it can walk . It 's very odd , it does n't match anything in nature today . We parallel it as an old man on crutches . - No . - No , sorry . It does not look real . That 's nearer . I do n't think it works .

You got it . - Yeah . - Right . - That 's good . - Yeah , that 's better . Well , he 's finished , we 're happy . We tried the parallel walk , the hop , different types of moves , but this alternate back leg , forward leg , other back leg , other forward leg , worked really well . Because his front legs are shorter , I gave his shoulders loads of reach , so he kind of swaggers forward like that . The extra reach compensates for short front legs . Here 's Liopleurodon . It 's flying through the water , alternating flippers . It 's an efficient movement which saves energy because it 's so big . As the back one's go down , the front one's are pushed up and vice versa . ' 0ne by one , the statues were
zone2	the palaeontologists were learning . ' Working with the animators and designers , I saw my skeletal reconstructions changed into a dynamic animal , moving . Doing that , I had to think seriously about the dynamics of the joints , the way the bones moved . That 's the difference these animation programs provide for us and that brings them more to life than I had appreciated . The film-makers , in making computer models and physical models , taught the palaeontologists some things - what does and does n't work . I 'm delighted information 's flowing both ways . When I say action , the sauropod comes in . Keep walking . All the way through . ' Up to now , the dinosaurs had not existed , ' at least not outside the computer . ' It had required some imagination to film them . ' Cut ! ' With the dinosaurs in absentia , ' everything had to be done for them . ' All the footprints , dust clouds and splashes . ' Every contact the dinosaurs made with the world ' had to
zone2	the footsteps made for them . ' In fact , that 's what happened next . ' Here is a background plate we shot in Chile of the forest , with some wonderful shafts of light . Into this we add Tyrannosaurus , who we 've generated in a computer , and this is him . I 'm going to overlay him onto the Chile background and this is him on his initial walk . Not yet interacting , not breaking the light and has no shadow . That 's part two . It 's not as easy as slapping the two together , there 's jiggery-pokery to do with the computer . Welcome to stage two . This is the dinosaur , his colour matched to the background . A ground shadow is underneath his feet , but the end effect is still not complete and to do this , the final adjustments are to add some breaking light as he walks past the light through the tree and a disappearance behind the trees in the distance . ' So the animals were put back where they belonged .
zone2	from 65 to 220 million years old . ' ' It was all very well releasing the animals , but how would they survive ? ' The giant sauropods ' were the biggest eating machines of all time . ' People have previously assumed that these vegetarians ' had such long necks to allow them to eat ' from the tops of trees . ' But all is not as it seems with the giant Diplodocus . ' As Kent Stevens discovered when he took a close look ' at the numerous bones that make up its neck . ' I built a computer model of Diplodocus and put all the bones together in a neutral position . Two surprises , one straight off the shoulders . 0ther surprise - this is as high as Diplodocus could raise its neck . It 's not designed for rearing up in the familiar swan shapes . This tells us Diplodocus was designed to browse low to the ground , sweeping back and forth like a vacuum cleaner . ' You wo n't see our Diplodocus eating from the treetops . ' Having
zone2	give hands-on tuition ' to a juvenile Diplodocus that was n't eating well . ' Bite and then pull that way , because wear marks are on the outside of the teeth . You get anything ? Try again . 0K , that gets a good chunk . That 's pretty good . 0pen up . That wear 's on the outside , it 's still a question , How did it do it ? ( Whirring ) ( Beep ) Move forward , have his mouth really open . 0K , now pull up . That works . Let go now . Look how much it 's eaten . ( Camerawhirring ) Mouth over the horsetail and then rip up . That 's good . That 's lovely . ' There is another way palaeontologists ' can get the lowdown on dinosaur diet . ' But you have to know what you 're looking for . ' Palaeontologist Karen Chin knows what she 's looking for . ' Some people think it 's odd studying fossil dung , but it actually provides a unique perspective on the ancient world
zone2	fossilised dung , ' a massive herd of dinosaurs roamed 76 million years ago . ' The ground is littered with their bones , ' and as it happens , ' their bodily waste has been preserved . ' Here 's some coprolites , or fossil dung , from a plant-eating dinosaur . They do n't look like much but there 's lots of chopped-up plant material in here and there are very distinctive burrows made by dung beetles burying dung for their young . When I examine coprolites , I take a thin section to look at under a microscope . I found that this black material is fragments of conifer wood . These particular plant-eating dinosaurs , probably duck-billed dinosaurs , fed on conifers . That does n't mean it was their diet , only what they fed on at the time . ( Gruntingbellow ) These specimens are interesting because they give us a glimpse of dinosaur diets . But what 's more exciting is they also give us a glimpse of the interactions of dinosaurs with other organisms . ' Although there is still dinosaur dung
zone2	A recipe we 're happy to reveal . ' Sawdust , a touch of wallpaper paste , water , and a lot of elbow grease . Dinosaur poo , big time . Makes a perfect poo every time . ( Panickedsquawking ) ( Roaring ) ( Angrychirping ) ' To understand how the carnivores should feed ' required a different strategy . Their food did not grow on trees . ' So the question was , how did they hunt ? ' You have to examine their shape , so say palaeontologists . ' Meat-eating dinosaurs lived a variety of lifestyles . We can tell by their hands , feet and heads . So a great variety of designs and a great variety of styles of living and hunting . ' Some of those brought to life were the raptors , ' Cretaceous predators that came in various sizes , ' but with a basic shape that reveals how they hunted . ' These are brainy , agile predators with a wide gape , but their teeth were nothing special . What is striking about them are the long arms
zone2	So this was a special predatory design . These raptors were swift runners , cheetah-like speed brought them to their prey . Long legs let them leap onto their back , slashing with a claw on the foot and grasping with the hands , penetrating the skin , biting , biting the back , working forward , and eventually the animal was weak from blood loss , and a final bite to the throat suffocating it . Tyrannosaurus had very stout legs , it had to support six tonnes of weight , after all . But these are not athlete 's legs , it was not a long-distance chaser . The arms are puny , trifling , could barely scratch the chin . It 's hard to figure out what good they were at all . The real weaponry was there , in the head . All the killing action was concentrated here . It came in close to its prey , opened its jaws and engulfed it . These teeth could penetrate skin , strip muscle from bone . They could actually crush bone . This was a formidable
zone2	of who they ate . ' At the University of Montana a piece of Triceratops hipbone ' bears witness to who fed on it . ' Palaeontologist Greg Erickson explains all . ' What intrigued us about this specimen is it 's riddled with bite marks , approximately 80 in total . Here and here . Some along the vertebra column . A really deep one . And just based on the size of these , we suspected that Tyrannosaurus Rex had fed upon this poor Triceratops . To test this , we used dental putty , like your dentist uses to cast your teeth . You push it down into the actual bite mark we want to make a mould of . This putty sets in five minutes , so we 'll have an answer as to whodunnit . ' This hipbone inspired a scene in the programme . ' First , a Triceratops was filmed being eaten . ' The animal doing the eating would be added later . ' Here it comes . 0K , get that out . And voila , there it is . 0K
zone2	you can see , the mould we 've just taken out is a match for a Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth . The aspect ratio , now let 's look end on , the serration ridge on the back side is also preserved on the specimen we pulled out . Smoking-gun evidence that Tyrannosaurus fed on Triceratops . ' In fact , Greg Erickson has discovered even more ' to guide the feeding habits of the recreated dinosaurs . ' The specimen told us about the feeding behaviour of Tyrannosaurus . These gouges show it employed puncture-and-pull biting behaviour . The teeth plunged through flesh and bone and pulled back using its five tonne body . Using this , it removed the entire front of the Triceratops pelvis and was consuming small pieces of bone . T-Rex was basically the biggest carnivore around , so it ate whatever it wanted . We find some interesting things in T-Rex bones . This is the brain case from a T-Rex found 25 miles north of here with this hole in its head . This is top of its skull , the neck muscles were
zone2	it fits beautifully into that hole and a portion of bone has spalled off here . This hole and injury healed , so this happened while this T-Rex was alive . We found some interesting things with a T-Rex found nearby we call Steven . Steven 's vertebrae were actually cut in half , and the spine , the part that takes the T-bone steaks , those were actually bitten away and gone , and we believe this is good evidence that T-Rex not only fought each other , they killed and even ate each other . ( Roaring ) ' The vegetarians would need to be able to protect themselves . ' Some , like the armoured dinosaurs , had obvious built-in defences . ' But other vegetarians had no natural protection . ' How are they going to look after themselves ? ' The answer lies among the ripples of a fossilised beach in Colorado . ' The beach has turned on its side ' but footprints are still clearly visible . ' We see an Iguanodon walking on all fours , the hind legs here and small
zone2	a horse . It 's probably easier for it to do than me because it was a lot bigger . But we can know more about dinosaurs besides how this one walked . In fact , this whole slope is covered with tracks , the whole ground was trampled . Many of these tracks are going in the same direction . It must have been a herd , walking on this beach 100 million years ago . ' It was n't just Iguanodon . ' In fact , there 's evidence ' for many plant-eating dinosaurs forming herds . ' 0ne famous vegetarian though ' had a completely different strategy . ' In the past , it 's been assumed ' that Stegosaurus used its plates to cool itself down . ' The idea being it would pump blood up to the plates ' where the excess heat could be dissipated . ' This comes from looking closely at the plates . ' The grooves were once blood vessels , ' but some think they had another use . ' I came up with an alternative idea . By increasing
zone2	display against , perhaps , an attacker . Imagine an Allosaurus comes upon a Stegosaurus . The Stegosaurus turns its body , increases that blood flow , suddenly the plates are standing out pink . The Stegosaurus could turn and swing that tail . It looks bigger and more vicious than the Allosaurus realises . ' 0ne of the characters in the series is called Torosaurus . ' This is one of a number of dinosaurs ' who sport huge crests . ' They look like shields , so since the year dot , ' people have assumed that these were defensive structures . ' But you wo n't see our creatures using their crests ' to fend off attackers . ' Because , as Peter Dodson explains , ' that idea is just plain nonsense . ' The idea that these crests protected the animal has a certain appeal , but the design really does n't hold up very well . Look at these great holes . What kind of protection would that be ? The holes are covered in skin , but still very thin . ( Bellowing
zone2	with each other for females . The frill was a display structure , like the tail of a peacock . It was probably brightly coloured . When the dinosaur dipped its head , the expanse of brightly coloured frill was a thrilling sight for a female . Males competed with each other for breeding rights , so they joined their horns together and they fought , they struggled . The stronger bull exhausted the weaker one and the victor had the breeding rights . In the same way that deer and antelope , the males , fight for breeding rights . So this gives us a deep insight into the biology of horned dinosaurs . T-Rexes mating . We can look at crocodiles to get an idea of that . They have to touch their cloaca , the single opening they do all their business through . It 's located at the base of the tail , so the male 's tail would wrap under the females and the female 's tail turns to allow the male 's penis to enter . It was ... It must have been quite

His legs have to be splayed apart , to get into that position it 's quite athletic . Surprising they ever managed it . 0ne female we worked with , called Sue , there 's a portion of the tail that looks like it was stepped on , there 's three fused vertebrae . That easily could have happened during a passionate moment . ' Before long , the inevitable happened , ' the dinosaurs were starting to mate . ( Lowroar ) ( Howls ) ' What happened next was well known . ' Eggs have been preserved for many different dinosaurs . ' Surprisingly , they 're never much bigger than a football , ' even for dinosaurs that grew 40 metres long . ' What had to be worked out was how they laid them . ( Rumblinggroan ) ' Take Diplodocus . They were not supple animals ' and could n't get low to the ground . ' How did
zone2	to come up with a possible solution . ' In the studio , an egg-laying contraption was put to work . ' Push , push . There you go . Go on , keep going . No , fine . Push , push ! This is turning out to be a difficult birth . The egg 's getting stuck . It 's not ready yet . This is an ovipositor , or egg tube . Sauropods were large and they lay hard eggs , so they had to have some way of getting them down without them cracking . So this is one solution , a muscular tube like a turtle has , that allowed the egg to pass down , drop in , then they could bury it . It looks a bit obscene , but it 's only a guess . It 's coming - ooh , and pull up . It 's a boy . ( Laughs ) ' In the water , something very different was going on . ' This astonishing Ichthyosaur fossil was found in Germany .

You fought extremely well . And lost only to a first-class opponent . Tie her wrists . Yes , Comrade . How well-staffed is the facility at the top of this mountain ? I have no idea . Look , miss , I warn you , I can not go on being polite to an American ... when we all know that the U.S . is behind this volcano business . Do you think that I 'd be sneaking around a Mexican mountain ... if the U.S . had anything at all to do with this ? In the first place , you two would be arrested . You 're asking me to believe that the I.A.D.C ... would send a single American agent

You have a saying in your country : " All good things must come to an end . " Regretfully . If you will listen to me , I have a few simple suggestions . Hold this , my comrade . I have seen him do better in the grip of a Siberian brown bear . It 's impossible . I find it totally believable . Yes , you Americans have won . Not only do you have your own strength ... but you have the strength of that terrible weapon ... whatever it is , on the mountaintop . No . That 's what I was trying to tell you . The United States has nothing
zone2	and , apparently , the Russians who have been hit . - Not the United States . - We ca n't be sure of that . First China . Then Russia . Who 's to say where this last beam struck ? If there is a pattern , then it was probably the United States . If we can just work together ... maybe we can destroy this weapon before it destroys us . You will not destroy anyone . Drop your weapons . If you resist , you will be destroyed ... with the exception of Wonder Woman . We all know that you are indestructible . But We are not here to destroy any of you . In fact , the man We serve Welcomes you . I 'd advise you to surrender , Tobirov . Drop your weapons . I 'll be back . No ! Wonder Woman , come back !

How did Dave Pruett benefit ? He is unharmed , sleeping peacefully . Just a little tired . Yeah , sure . Who is this genius ? He is anxious to see you . By the way ... how did you get out of your rather pressing problem down at the hotel ? Wonder Woman . The lady does get around , does n't she ? Come on . Sometimes . I ca n't stand this helpless feeling . No word from Diana since she left the hotel ? Nothing . Total silence . - Just like Pruett . - Let 's not get into that . I still have n't

But if it is true ... then their embassies will be contacting us , eventually . You can bank on it . They 'll be strutting around , pointing their fingers . We know you 're behind this . What have you done with our agents ? Then we 've really got something to worry about . In the meantime ? All we can do is wait . Hope that Diana finds some way to contact us . Unless we hear from whoever 's behind it . Even that would be a relief . At least we 'd know who we 're dealing with . Arthur Chapman ? You may leave us . Do n't you have some communication to arrange ? Of course . Well , Diana ... it 's been a long time . Two years . I should have guessed it . You 've come a long way in two years .

One morning , I came out of a meeting ... and they were all there . The Joint Chiefs of Staff , the State Department ... somebody from the Bureau , the Company . I took one look at them and said : " Either they 're mad or I 'm mad . " I 'm not sure which one you decided . I told you . I changed my mind . The obedient inventor changed his mind . Millions have been made , no , billions have been made off my copyright . And all my toys ... have been used for war games . Is war a game ? That is exactly my point . Now ... there will be peace .

All ofyou , Wherever you are . I have interrupted every radio and television program ... because there is something I must speak to you about . And you must listen . I Want to speak to you ... about peace . now , every nation speaks about peace . But no one does enough to achieve it . Except me . Millions of Weapons are still being manufactured ... in the name of defense and deterrent . now , I tell you , this must stop . It Will stop . Or almost every one of you listening Will know the meaning of Armageddon . The final battle between good and evil . - It 's Arthur Chapman . - The physicist who dropped out ? I had hoped ...

He 'll use the laser beam to carry out his threat . What , Volcano Earth ? There 's no stopping him . You ca n't fight it . No one can . You do n't sound so convinced .

Calls have been made to the Chairman of the Soviet Union ... the Premier of the People 's Republic of China . The Strategic Air Command 's been alerted . The planes are already in the air . What about Diana and the others ? I guess that 's why there 's room at the top . Nobody wants to be here . Well ? No luck so far . There 's nothing she can do in the time left . I would n't be so sure about that . You still think the old I.A.D.C . will come through ? - You do n't want to hear what I think . - But of course I would . As soon as I get a clear

So that I could witness a third world disaster ? And stand by for the next ? But , no , Wonder Woman . I am doing this in the name of peace . The idea of peace is beautiful . But this is no way to accomplish it . Why do n't you ask the people ... whose lives depend on what their leaders decide ? As a matter of fact ... I really do n't have to ask anyone . Corbin , tell her how we 've suffered . Just tell her . I ca n't , Arthur . I agree with her . It wo n't work . Not your way . We have to work for peace , but not by intimidation . Fools have said that since the beginning of time . Everybody is a fool to

And the Russians ... what about them ? Our answers will be planes and submarines ... missiles and tanks . Whatever it takes to destroy you . We have always fought that Way . And the People 's Republic of China ? There are 800 million of us . If there are 10 percent left ... we will still , eventually , dominate the world . It is called " the long view . " Chapman ... you have created ... the deadliest , the most dangerous weapon the world has ever known ... in the name of peace . But you believe in peace , Wonder Woman . You always have . Yes . But it Wo n't Work your Way . I 'm sure the world 's leaders would listen to you ... once there was no more threat . Believe me , you ... " Telephonic communication has

Tell them that you 're deactivating the computer . And then they 'll know they 're right . Every government will be convinced that it was tough and it was strong . Those are your words , Jack . And anybody who yielded to me ... will be branded as a weakling , as a traitor . - No ! I tell you , I was right ! - No ! What have you done ? I have done what I had to do . I 'm sorry .

May I speak for both of us ? You may always do so , if you wish . Col . Minh , we have served you loyally and well . You have . We would be most grateful if you would accept our resignations . I do not think such a decision should be made here and now . Why not , Colonel ? They could have been lost . Officially

There may be even some little Lin Wans and Mei Lings . That is the future that you 're talking about , is n't it ? Apparently , it is out of my hands . There is some truth to the belief ... that it is easy to lose oneself in Chinatown . May I suggest that you do so ? After dinner . Of course . Thank you . It 's a shame that Prof . Chapman ... could n't have handled his problems with the same reason . He 'll have to be put away . Mr . Corbin , I think that the I.A.D.C . is gon na try and intervene . And we have Wonder Woman to thank . She has helped you in the past , I 'm told . I wish I might meet her one day . - When you do , will you cook for her , too ? - An honor

Us . We 've been on one date , Jason . You ca n't have an us after one date . You can only have a stalker situation . Am I clear on that ? That hurts me . Subtle does n't seem to cut it with you , Jason . You know , I 'm not one of your goddamn insects , Remi . You know what I 'm saying ? Bye . You'ire right about one thing . Subtle does n't cut it with me . Oh , God . I 'm a wacko magnet . Sorry . Excuse me . Mmm . Now , your common household cockroach ... takes it a step further . Not only does he use food to attract a female ... but he mounts her as soon as she dips down to eat it . Mmm .
zone2	n't find her external genitalia ... through all that body armor ... . so dinner ends up being kind of a bust ... from a biological perspective . Now , your common female bed bug ... needs no external genitalia whatsoever . The male simply impales her wherever he wants ... and if she 's lucky enough to survive the experience ... she may actually reproduce . You can always tell the number of times she 's mated ... by counting the scars . Some more wine ? Hmm . Well , sorry for goin ' off at the mouth like that . It 's ... that was getting a little bit schized . Hey , schized works for me . Mm mm Well , anyway , thanks for a really nice evening . Are you sure you do n't want to grab a night cap ?

That means you 're into bugs . I 'll ... Get that . Huh . You really like these crusty little bastards , huh ? I admire their simplicity . They are what they are no matter how you dress ' em up . Huh . Not like people , you mean . Yeah . Not like people . Uh-huh . Well , you know , I should probably ... pay a little more attention to our insect friends ... instead of whacking ' em with my shoe . If you 're serious and not just patronizing me ... there 's a book
zone2	you might find interesting . Really ? Oh , yeah ? That 's a real page-turner , huh ? It better be . I wrote it . So , what exactly are you searching for , Detective ? About right now I 'm searching for some information ... on a guy named Lincoln Trahn . I heard what happened . He was , he was a colleague of yours , right ? Colleague ? Lincoln Trahn sold endangered species ... on the black market . At least 200 species of arthropod ... are now extinct thanks to Lincoln Trahn . So he was an enemy , I mean on a professional level . I ca n't say I miss him . What are you writing ? It 's a ... grocery list . No . No , wait a minute . I did n't hate him like that . Like what ? You guys work on a quota system ? Ten bucks a suspect , something like that ? I 'm real terribly sorry ... to have troubled you , Miss Panos . Thank you . You 're wagging .
zone2	Thank you very much for your hospitality . Good night . Aah ! Yeah , I had a problem with Jason Mundy . He was a creep . Just ask my front door . You know , besides rating low on your likability list ... Jason Mundy and Lincoln Trahn ... . they had something else in common . You want to guess what that is ? No . They were both missing their faces . You know , I 'm not really a shrink ... but I 'd have to say that ... you really have to hate looking at someone ... to want to rip his face clean off . This ... this is crazy . Uh-huh . You know , one of your ... one of your close friends describes you here as ... " Pathologically unable to sustain ... " a proximate intrapersonal relationship ... " with anything that walks on two legs . " Huh ? Yeah , I had to bring home a Webster 's for that one . Am I under arrest ? No . I do n't need the ten bucks quite

Hand that over . - Fuck off . - Hey . Give me the goddamn desk . That desk weighs over 200 pounds , asshole . So did Jason Mundy . Now , if you can tell me how a 112-pound woman ... picked him up and chucked him over a fuckin ' lamppost ... I will give you a prime suspect

Of course you are ... even though you find me pathologically unable ... to sustain a proximate intrapersonal relationship ... whatever the hell that means . But you think I said that ? You 're the only pompous blow hard I know , Morrie . You 'll have my resignation in the morning ... if you do n't fire me first . Hmm . Hello ? You hurt ? You hungry ? Ugh ! Ugh . You want somethin ' else , Lou ? Nah . I got ta get back to the school . The gum is hardening under those chairs as we speak . Yeah . You want a box for that ? No , no . I got it . Yeah ?

Ok , Nicky , got a light ? - What ? - A match ! Something . Yeah . What ? What are we doin ' down here , Remi ? Remi . What the hell was that ? Are you gon na answer me , Remi ? Do you remember how not so long ago ... a lot of children were sick ... from a terrible disease spread by cockroaches ? Yeah , sort of . We created a new breed of insect ... we hoped would make the roaches die out . Well , not all of_'em
zone2	Into people ? Not really . You see , some insects ... overtime they evolve to look and act like other insects . It 's a way of confusing their natural enemies . We call them mimics . But these particular guys did n't evolve ... to just look like another bug or animal . They evolved to mimic their only real predator ... us . Looks kind of like Lou , the janitor . No , Sal . That 's not possible . They ca n't mimic specific people . I do n't know . You ask me , that 's Lou 's face . No . That 's not possible . Fuck ! Come on . Wake up . We 'll be OK , Sal . I promise . Remember , it 's not a monster . It 's an insect ... and insects , they behave in very predictable ways . It has no reason to hurt us . Understand ? I stood as close as I 'm standing to you right now ... and it did n't hurt me . What about Mr . Deaver ?
zone2	Have you ever poked a bee 's nest ... and all the bees , they fly out and try to sting you ? It 's because you disturbed their nest . They 're just acting on instinct . Are we in the nest ? In a way . In a way , yes , I think we are . Now we have to be very careful not to disturb it . Ow . Uhh ! Do we have to stay in here ? No . Not long . Just long enough to figure out the best way to leave . Ok ? It 's OK . I 'm not scared . Good . Then neither am I . Unh ! What are you doing ? I do n't know . " Lincoln . " Who ? " Lincoln Trahn . " Just do n't ! Do n't open it . Why not ? Just leave it alone . Whatever you say . - Nicky ! - I did n't do it ! It 's nothing . It 's just dirt . It 's nothing . Shit ! Shit ! Get

This is the nest . I think we just disturbed it . OK . Oh , come on . It wo n't hurt us . At least not until it finds out what went down in here . That should give us enough time ... to get back upstairs ... slip through the gap in the barricade , get to a phone . Then what ? Then we wait . No way . Running would be a big mistake . Hopefully we can stall it by closing a few doors . You call that a plan ? You got a better one ? Yeah ! Yeah ... Find a few more of these , pound ' em into spikes ... go out there and beng the motherfucker ... then we rabbit like hell ! Number one , you 'd never puncture
zone2	we 're dealing with a soldier that kills when provoked ... and number three , you are so intoxicated ... . the only damage you 're likely to inflict is with your breath . What the hell do you know , anyway ? Your only chance in hell , Nicky , is what I know . The genetics of this breed may be scrambled all to hell ... but it began as a cockroach ... so it should still basically behave like a cockroach . Like a cockroach ? Roaches are negatively phototactic ... which means they run from light . They 're also thigmotactic ... which means they like tight , confined spaces ... so keep away from walls and large clustered objects . They also have sensors ... that detect subtle variations in air movement ... so running will draw one out ... a hell of a lot faster than walking . They also demonstrate a remarkable capacity ... for insight learning . What 's that ? The ability to learn from their own mistakes ... Let 's put some head and shoulders ... above just about anybody
zone2	am I gon na be graded on this later ? No . Strictly pass-fail . See anything ? Me neither . All right , remember . Slow , stick to the center of the hall ... and stay behind me . Keep your breathing shallow . Try not to sweat . Sweat attracts ' em , too . - You through ? - Yeah . Aah ! Nicky . Sorry . Sorry . Let 's go . It 's not recharged . Let 's go anyway . Come on .

You do n't think this is an Army concern ... you take it up with whatever governing authority ... That shake out of bed at 3:00 in the morning . All right , ladies .

What do you mean ? I know , you know , like a distraction ... a decoy or something . Clothes , maybe . We 'd have to leave ' em behind in roughly the same positions , it 's ... We do n't know this 'll work . - We do n't know it won't . - That 's not bad . All right . - You and Sal go . - No . Sal , this is your best chance and you 're taking it . You understand ? Nicky and I , we 're right behind you , ok ? Please , get Sal out of here . Do whatever it takes . I 'm coming back if you 're not out that door in 60 seconds . Fair enough . OK ... ... . OK , come on ,

zone2	3300733 Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Hey let me ask you something . Thank you . Thank you . Why ? Why ? Why ? Why ? Why is it that most of the people who are against abortion are people you would n't want to fuck in the first place huh ? Huh ? Boy these conservatives are really something are n't they ? They 're all in favor of the unborn . They will do anything for the unborn but once you 're born you 're on your own . Pro-life conservatives are obsessed with the fetus from conception to nine months . After that they do n't want to know about you . They do n't want to hear from you . No nothing . No neonatal care , no daycare , no head start , no school lunch , no food stamps , no welfare , no nothing . If you 're preborn you 're fine . If you 're preschool you 're fucked . You 're fucked . Conservatives do n't give a shit about you until you reach military age . Then they think you are just fine . Just
zone2	so they can raise them to be dead soldiers . Pro-life . Pro-life . These people are n't pro-life they 're killing doctors . What kind of pro-life is that ? What they 'll do anything they can to save a fetus but if it grows up to be a doctor they just might have to kill it ? They 're not pro-life . You know what they are ? They 're anti-woman . Simple as it gets . Anti-woman . They do n't like them . They do n't like women . They believe a woman 's primary role is to function as a broodmare for the state . Pro-life . You do n't see many of these white anti-abortion women volunteering to have any black fetuses transplanted into their uteruses do you ? No you do n't see them adopting a whole lot of crack babies do you ? No that might be something Christ would do . And you wo n't see ... you wo n't see a lot of these pro-life people dousing themselves in kerosene and lighting themselves on fire . You know morally committed
zone2	Goddamn demonstration did n't they ? Huh ? Hey . They knew how to put on a fucking protest . Light yourself on fire ! Come on you moral crusaders let 's see a little smoke to match that fire in your belly . Here 's another question I have . How come when it 's us it 's an abortion and when it 's a chicken it 's an omelet ? What ? Are we so much better than chickens all of a sudden ? When did this happen that we pass chickens in goodness ? Name six ways we 're better than chickens . See nobody can do it . You know why ? Cause chickens are decent people . You do n't see chickens hanging around in drug gangs do you ? You do n't see a chicken strapping some guy to a chair and hooking up his nuts to a car battery do you ? When 's the last chicken you heard about came home from work and beat the shit out of his hen ? Does n't happen cause chickens are decent people . Well
zone2	is a fetus a human being ? This seems to be the central question . Well if a fetus is a human being how come the census does n't count them ? If a fetus is a human being how come when there 's a miscarriage they do n't have a funeral . If a fetus is a human being how come people say we have two children and one on the way instead of saying we have three children ? People say life begins at conception , I say life began about a billion years ago and it 's a continuous process . Continuous , just keeps rolling along . Rolling . Rolling . Rolling along . I said you know something ? Listen , you can go back further than that . What about the carbon atoms ? Huh ? Human life could not exist without carbon so is it just possible that maybe we should n't be burning all this coal ? Just looking for a little consistency here in these anti-abortion arguments . See the really hardcore people will tell you life begins at fertilization .
zone2	usually a few moments after the man says , " Gee honey I was going to pull out but the phone rang and it startled me . " Fertilization . But even after the egg is fertilized it 's still six or seven days before it reaches the uterus and pregnancy begins and not every egg makes it that far . 80% of a woman 's fertilized eggs are rinsed and flushed out of her body once a month during those delightful few days she has . They wind up on sanitary napkins and yet they are fertilized eggs . So basically what these anti-abortion people are telling us is that any woman who 's had more than one period is a serial killer . Consistency . Consistency . Hey , hey if they really want to get serious what about all the sperm that are wasted when the state executes a condemned man and one of these pro-life guys who 's watching comes in his pants huh ? Here 's a guy standing over there with his jockey shorts full of little Vinnie 's and Debbie 's and nobody
zone2	ejaculation deserves a name . Now speaking of consistency Catholics , which I was until I reached the age of reason , Catholics Catholics and other Christians are against abortions and they 're against homosexuals . Well who has less abortions than homosexuals ? Leave these fucking people alone for Crist sakes . Here is an entire class of people guaranteed never to have an abortion and the Catholics and Christians are just tossing them aside . You 'd think they 'd make natural allies . Go look for consistency in religion . And speaking of my friends , the Catholics , when John Cardinal O'Connor of New York and some of these other cardinals and bishops have experienced their first pregnancies and their first labor pains and they 've raised a couple of children on a minimum wage then I 'll be glad to hear what they have to say about abortion . I 'm sure it will be interesting and enlightening too but but in the meantime what they ought to be doing is telling these priests who took a vow of chastity to keep their hands off
zone2	you know ? When Jesus said , " Suffer the little children come onto me , " that 's not what he was talking about . So you know what I tell these anti-abortion people ? I say , Hey , hey if you think a fetus is more important than a woman try getting a fetus to wash the shit stains out of your underwear . For no pay and no pension . I tell them to think of an abortion as term limits , that 's all it is . Biological term limits . But you know the longer you listen to this abortion debate the more you here this phrase sanctity of life . You 've heard that , sanctity of life . You believe in it ? Personally I think it 's a bunch of shit . Well I mean life is sacred ? Who said so ? God ? Hey if you read history you realize that God is one of the leading causes of death . Has been for thousands of years . Hindus , Muslims , Jews , Christians all taking turns killing
zone2	idea . The sword of God , the blood of the Lamb , vengeance is my millions of dead motherfuckers . Millions of dead motherfuckers all because they gave the wrong answer to the God question . You believe in God ? No . Dead . You believe in God ? Yes . You believe in my God ? No . Dead . My God has a bigger dick than your God . Thousands of years ... Thousands of years and all the best wars too . The bloodiest most brutal wars fought all based on religious hatred , which is fine with me . Hey anytime a bunch of holy people want to kill each other I 'm a happy guy . But do n't be giving me all this shit about the sanctity of life . I mean even if there were such a thing I do n't think it 's something you can blame on God . No you know what the sanctity of life came from ? We made it up . You know why ? Cause were alive . Self-interest . Living people have a
zone2	sacred . You do n't see Abbott and Costello running around talking about this shit do you ? Were not hearing a whole lot from Mussolini on the subject . What 's the latest from JFK ? Not a Goddamn thing cause JFK , Mussolini and Abbott and Costello are fucking dead . They 're fucking dead . And dead people give less than a shit about the sanctity of life . Only living people care about it so the whole thing grows out of a completely biased point of view . It 's a self-serving , man-made bullshit story . It 's one of these things we tell ourselves so we 'll feel noble . Life is sacred . Makes you feel noble . But let me ask you this . If everything that ever lived is dead and everything alive is going to die where does the sacred part come in ? I 'm having trouble with that . Cause I mean even with this stuff we preach about the sanctity of life we do n't practice it . We do n't practice it . Look at what
zone2	Lions and tigers cause it 's fun . Chickens and pigs cause we 're hungry . Pheasants and quails cause it 's fun and we 're hungry . And people . We kill people cause their pests and it 's fun . And you might have noticed something else . The sanctity of life does n't seem to apply to cancer cells does it ? You rarely see a bumper sticker that says , Save the tumors or I break for advanced melanoma . Nah viruses , mold , mildew , maggots , fungus , weeds , ecoli bacteria , the crabs , nothing sacred about those things . So at best the sanctity of life is kind of a selective thing . We get to choose which forms of life we feel are sacred and we get to kill the rest . Pretty neat deal huh ? You know how we got it ? We made the whole fucking thing up . Made it up . The same way Thank you . The same way we made up the death penalty . We made them both up . Sanctity
zone2	? And you know in this country now there are a lot of people who want to expand the death penalty to include drug dealers . This is really stupid . Drug dealers are n't afraid to die . They 're already killing each other every day on the streets by the hundreds . Drive-bys , gang shootings , they 're not afraid to die . Death penalty does n't mean anything unless you use it on people who are afraid to die like the bankers who launder the drug money . The bankers who launder the drug money . Forget the dealers . You want to slow down that drug traffic you got to start executing a few of these fucking bankers . White middle class Republican bankers . And I 'm not talking I 'm not talking about soft American executions like lethal injection . I 'm talking about fucking crucifixion folks . Let 's bring back crucifixion , a form of capital punishment that Christians and Jews of America can really appreciate . And I 'd go a little further . I 'd crucify people upside down
zone2	And naked . I 'd have naked , upside down crucifixions on TV once a week at half time on the monday night football game . Monday night . The monday night crucifixions . You 'd have people tuning in do n't even care about football . Would n't you like to hear Dan Deardorf explain why the nails have to go in at a certain angle ? And I 'll guarantee you one thing you start executing , you start nailing one white banker per week to a big wooden cross on national TV you 're going to see that drug traffic begin to slow down pretty fucking quick . Pretty fucking quick . You wo n't even be able to buy drugs in schools and prisons anymore . Now I do n't care about capital punishment one way or another cause I know it does n't do anything . It does n't do anything except maybe satisfy a kind of a biblical need for revenge . You know if you read the bible you see that it 's full of retribution and revenge so really capital punishment is
zone2	rite . It 's a modern sacrament and as long as that 's true I say let 's liven it up a little . I honestly believe if you make the death penalty a little more entertaining and learn to market it correctly you just might be able to raise enough money to balance the stupid fucking budget . Balance the stupid fucking budget . And do n't forget the polls show the American people want capital punishment and they want a balanced budget and I think even in a fake democracy people ought to get what they want once in a while just to feed this illusion that there really in charge . Let 's use capital punishment the same way we use sports and television in this country to distract people and take their minds off how bad their being fucked by the upper 1% . Now unfortunately unfortunately monday night football does n't last long enough . What we really need is year round capital punishment on TV every night with sponsors . Got to have sponsors . I 'm sure as long we 're killing people
zone2	. Proud to participate . Balance the stupid fucking budget . And let me say this to you my interesting Judea Christian friends not only not only do I recommend crucifixions I 'd be in favor of bringing back beheadings . Beheadings on TV , slow motion , instant replay and maybe you could let the heads roll down a little hill and fall into one of five numbered holes . Yeah . Let the people at home gamble on which hole the head is going to fall into . And you do it in a stadium so the mob can gamble on it too . Raise a little more money and if you want to expand the violence a little longer to sell a few more commercials instead of using an axe you do the beheadings with a hand saw . Hey do n't bail out on me now God damn it . The blood is already on our hands all were talking about is a matter of degree . You want something a little more delicate ? We 'll do the beheadings with an olive fork . That
zone2	Goddamn long time . There 's a lot of good things we could be doing . When 's the last time we burned someone at the stake ? It 's been too long . Here 's another form of capital punishment comes out of a nice rich religious tradition , burning people at the stake sponsor , Bridgeford Charcoal . And you put it on TV on Sunday mornings . The Sunday morning Evangelical Send Us An Offering Praise Jesus Human Bonfire . You do n't think that would get big ratings in this sick fucking country ? Shit you 'd have people skipping church to watch this stuff . And you take the money they send in the offerings and you use it To balance the budget . What about boiling people in oil ? Boy those were the days were n't they ? You get the oil going real good , you know ? A nice high rolling boil and then slowly at the end of a rope you lower the perpetrator head first into the boiling oil huh ? You talk about fun shit . And just
zone2	stadium control the speed of the rope . Good clean , wholesome family entertainment . The kids will love it . The kids will love it and at the same time their enjoying themselves were teaching them a nice Christian moral lesson . Oiling people in oil . Sponsor , Crisco . And maybe instead of boiling all these guys every now and then you could French fry a couple of them . French fried felons . Dip a guy in egg batter just for a goof you know ? Kind of a tempura thing huh ? Jeffrey Dahmer never thought of this shit did he ? Jeffrey Dahmer eat your heart out , which is an interesting thought in of itself . All right enough nostalgia what about some modern forms of capitol punishment ? How about we throw a guy off the World Trade Center and whoever he lands on wins the Publishers Clearing House huh ? Okay something a little more sophisticated : You dip a guy in brown gravy and lock him in a small room with a wolverine who 's high on angel dust .
zone2	fucking with too many kids at the bus stop for a while huh ? Here 's something really nice you could do . You shoot a guy out of a high-speed catapult right into a brick wall . Trouble is it would be over too quick . No good for TV you know , you 'd have to do a whole bunch of guys right in a row . Rapid-fire capital punishment . Fifteen catapults while you 're shooting off one you 're loading up the others . Of course every now and then you would have to stop to clean off the wall . Cleanliness right next to Godliness . All right high tech . I sense some of you 's are waiting for high tech . I got it . You take a small tactical nuclear weapon and stick it up a guy 's ass . A thermal nuclear suppository . Preparation-H Bomb . You talk about fallout huh ? Whoa ! Or you take the bomb and you stick it just inside that little hole on the end of a guy 's dick you know ? Yeah
zone2	off the guy would n't know whether he was coming or going . Get out of here . I got you . Hey listen Hey I got a lot of good ideas . Balance the stupid fucking budget . Here 's another idea . I 'm going to save you a whole lot of money on prisons but at the same time we are still going to remove from society many of our more unannoying citizens . Four groups are going away permanently . First group violent criminals . Here 's what you do with these Emmy Award winners . You take the entire state of Kansas , you move everybody out . You give them a couple hundred dollars for their inconvenience you know ? That 'll be fair and then you move them out , you put a big ten-story electric fence around Kansas and Kansas becomes a permanent prison farm for violent criminals . No parole , no police , no supplies the only thing you give them is lethal weapons and live ammunition so they can communicate in a meaningful way . Then you put the
zone2	VNN and for a corporate sponsor you get one of those company 's that loves to smear its logo feces all over the landscape , Budweiser will jump at this shit in half a minute . All right next group , sex criminals . Completely incurable you got to lock them up . You could outlaw religion and most of these sex crimes would disappear in a couple of generations but we do n't have time for rational solutions . Much easier to fence off another rectangular state . Rectangular states are cheaper to fence , saves the taxpayers money you know ? This time Wyoming but only for true sex offenders . We 're not going to bother consenting adults who like to dress up in leather Boy Scout uniforms and smash each other in the head with ballpeen hammers while they take turns blowing their cat . There 's certainly nothing wrong with that . It 's a victimless hobby and think of how good the cat must feel . No were only going to lock up rapist and molesters , those hopeless romantics who are so full
zone2	it on you . Usually on your leg . You take all these heavy breathing fun seekers and you stick them in Wyoming and you let them suck , fuck and fondle . You let them blow , chew , sniff , lick , whip , gobble and corn hole each other until their testicles are whistling O'Come All Ye Faithful . Then you turn on the cameras and you got the Sperm Channel and do n't forget our corporate sponsor , were going to let Budweiser put little logo patches on the rapists pants right here , This Pud 's for You . All right next group , drug addicts and alcoholics . Not all of them , do n't get nervous , just the one's who are making life difficult for at least one other person . And were not going to bother first offenders . People deserve a chance to clean up . Everyone will get twelve chances to clean up . Okay . All right . Fifteen ... fifteen . That 's fine and that 's it . If you ca n't make it in fifteen
zone2	perfect place for staying loaded . Each week all of the illegal drugs confiscated in the United States that the police and DEA do n't keep for their own personal use , will be air dropped into Colorado . And were going to turn the Coors Brewery over to the beer drinking assholes and everyone can stay wasted , wired , stoned , bombed , hammered , smashed and shit-faced around the clock on another new cable channel , Shit Faced Central this is the real Rocky Mountain High ! Okay I 've saved my favorite group for last . The maniacs and crazy people . Yeah . The one's who live out where the buses do n't run . And I distinguish between maniacs and crazy people . A maniac will beat nine people to death with a steel dildo . A crazy person will beat nine people to death with a steel dildo but he 'll be wearing a Bugs Bunny suit at the time . So you ca n't put them all away . You know you got to keep some of them around just for the
zone2	King of Sweden is using his penis as a radio transmitter to send anti-Semitic lesbian meatloaf recipes to Soupy Sales and Marvin Hamlish . A guy like that you want to give him his own radio show . No the maniac farm will be reserved strictly for hopeless cases like a guy who gets a big tattoo on his chest of Liza Minnelli taking a shit . You know ? And he tells you if he wiggles a certain way it looks like she 's wiping her ass you know ? A guy like that you want to get him into custody as quickly as possible . Now for the maniac farm I think there 's no question we got to go with Utah . Utah , easy to fence ... easy to fence , right next to Wyoming and Colorado and Colorado is right next Kansas and that means all four groups of our most amusing citizens are now in one place except for the big fences and I think I have another one of my really good ideas for cable TV . Gates . Small sliding gates in
zone2	Think of what you 've got . Predators , degenerates , crack heads and fruitcakes . Nine hundred miles of fence separating them . Every fifty miles you put a small sliding gate but the gates are only ten inches wide and there only open once a month for seven seconds . And you know something fuck cable this shit has got to be on pay-per-view . Because if those gates are only open seven seconds a month you are going to have some mighty interesting people pushing and shoving to be first on line . Deeply disturbed , armed , cranky lunatics on drugs . You know the one's . A lot of tattoos , lot of teeth broken off at the gum line , the true face of America and every time you open the gates a few of the more aggressive one's are going to get through . The cr ? me da la cr ? me . The alphas . They 're going to get through . Their going to find each other and their going to cross breed and pretty soon you have a melting
zone2	and full-blown wackoloons wondering the landscape in search of truth and fun . Just like now . Everyone will have guns . Everyone will have drugs and no one will be in charge . Just like now . But at least we 'll have a balanced budget . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you very much . I appreciate it . Thank you . Thank you . Hey . Hey . Hey time for a few fart jokes . Where would a comedy show be without a few fart jokes ? Question Did you ever have to fart on a bus or an airplane or in some public place but you had n't been farting all that day so you did n't really know the nature of the beast . You only knew there was lots of it . In a situation like that what you have to do is to release a test fart . You have to arrange to release quietly and in a carefully controlled manner about ten to fifteen percent of the total fart in order to determine if those around you can handle
zone2	be about to precipitate a public health emergency . When releasing a test fart it is often good to engage in an act of subterfuge , such as reaching for a magazine . Say , is that Golf Digest ? That does n't smell too horrifying . In fact in an odd way it 's rather pleasant . I think they ought to enjoy the rest of this baby . And it turns out to be one of those farts that would strip the varnish off a footlocker . A fart that could end a marriage . And everyone around you heads for the exits . Even the people on the airplane . As you realize it is time to review your fiber intake . It might not be necessary after all each morning to eat an entire wicker swing set . I have no ending for this so I take a small bow . Thank you . I appreciate that . Thank you . Okay . And this next thing this next thing is about the English language . It 's about little expressions we use . We all
zone2	use all the time most of us and we never really seem to examine these expressions very carefully at all we just sort of say these things as if they really made sense . Like " Legally drunk . " Well if it 's legal what 's the fucking problem ? Hey , leave my friend alone officer he 's legally drunk . " You know where can stick it . " Well why do we always assume everyone knows where they can stick it ? Suppose you do n't know . Suppose you 're a new guy . You have absolutely no idea where to stick it . I think there ought to be a government booklet entitled , " Where to Stick It . " Now that I think of it I believe there is a government booklet like that . They send it to you on April 15th . " Undisputed Heavy Weight Champion . " Well if it 's undisputed what 's all the fighting about ? " It 's the quiet one's you got to watch . " You know that one huh ? Every
zone2	TV what do they do ? They bring on the neighbor and then the neighbor says , Well he was always very quiet . And someone in the room says , It 's the quiet one's you got to watch . This sounds to me like a very dangerous assumption . I will bet you anything that while you 're watching the quiet one a noisy one will fucking kill you . Suppose you 're in a bar and one guy sitting over on the side reading a book not bothering anybody , another guy standing up at the front with a machete banging on the bar saying , I 'll kill the next motherfucker who comes in here . Who you going to watch ? You 're God damn right . " Lock them up and throw away the key . " This is really stupid . Where you going to throw the key ? Right out in front of the jail ? His friends will find it . How far can you throw a key ? Fifty , sixty feet the most . Even if you lay it
zone2	what do you get an extra ten feet tops . This is a stupid idea . Needs to be completely rethought . " Down the tubes . " You hear that one alot , people say , Awe the country is going down the tubes . What tubes ? Have you seen any tubes ? Where are these tubes ? And where do they go ? And how come there 's more than one tube ? It would seem to me one country one tube . What does every state all of a sudden have to have it 's own tube now ? One tube is all you need . But a tube that big somebody would have seen it by now . Somebody would have said , Hey Joey ... Joey look at the fucking tube . Big ass fucking tube over here . You never here that . You know why ? No tubes . We do n't have tube one . We are essentially tubeless . " Takes the cake . " You know ? Say , Boy he really takes the cake . Where ? Where
zone2	know where I would take a cake down to the bakery to see the other cakes . And how come he takes the cake ? How come he do n't take the pie ? The pie is easier to carry than the cake . " Easy as pie . " Hey wait , cake is not too hard to carry either . " Piece of cake . " " The greatest thing since sliced bread . " So this is it huh folks ? A couple hundred thousand years . The fucking pyramids for Christ sakes . Panama Canal . The Great Wall of China . Even a lava lamp to me is greater than sliced bread . What 's so great about sliced bread ? You got a knife : You got a loaf of bread slice the fucking thing ! And get on with your life . " Out walking the streets . " You know guy gets a parole . They say , Now instead of being in prison this guy is out walking the streets . How do we know ? Maybe the guy 's home
zone2	is out walking the fucking streets . A lot of times they steal a car you know ? So we ought to be glad . Thank God he stole a car . At least he 's not out walking the streets . " Fine and dandy . " That 's an old fashioned one that ya hear . Say to a guy , How are ya ? Just fine and dandy . Not me . I never say that . You know how come ? Cause I 'm never both of those things at the same time . Sometimes I 'm fine not dandy . Close to dandy . Approaching dandy . In the vicinity of dandy hood not quite fully dandy . Other times I am indeed highly dandy . However , not fine . One time One time in 1965 August for about an hour I was both fine and dandy at the same time but nobody asked me how I was . And I could have told them . Could have told them . Could have told them . I could have said to the person ,
zone2	. " Walking papers . " You know ? Guy gets fired . You say , Gees poor guy . Well they give him his walking papers today . Did you ever get any walking papers ? Seriously ? Believe me in my life I got fired a lot of times . You can tell . Never got any walking papers . Never got a pink slip either . You know what I would get ? A guy would come around to my desk and say , Get the fuck out of here ! You do n't need paper for that . It 's like " The Riot Act . " " The Riot Act . " They keep telling you their going to read that to you . Have you heard this thing at all ? Especially when you 're a kid they threaten you . You wait till your father comes home . He 's going to read you the riot act . Tell him I already read it myself and I did n't like it either . I consider it wordy and poorly thought out . He
zone2	's Guide to the Golden Age of Blow Jobs . ' " More than happy . " I bet you say that sometimes do n't you ? Once in a while you say to somebody , Oh I 'd be more than happy to do that . How can you be more than happy ? To me this sounds like a dangerous mental condition . We had to put Dave in the mental home . He was more than happy . One more of these . " In your own words . " People say that to you ? You know when you hear that a lot in a classroom or in a courtroom they 'll say to you , Tell us in your own words . Do you have your own words ? Hey I 'm using the one's everybody else has been using . Next time they tell you to say something in your own words say , Nik flak flarnee kloundo floo . Thank you . Thank you . Now this next piece of material is real simple it 's called free-floating hostility . Twenty-four minor culture
zone2	. So I hope you 're ready for a little random anger . People People People who make quote marks in the air with their finger . Are you tired of these people yet ? He said he was , " Sober . " Hey lady , " Eat me . " Budda-boom budda-bing . Next guy says to me budda-boom budda-bing is getting kicked right in the fucking nuts . Budda-boom mother fucker ! You want to try budda-bing ? Bad hair day . Where did this shit come from ? What a superficial culture . Put on a hat and go to work you shallow cunt . It 's a good thing Lewis and Clark never had a bad hair day or Daniel Boone huh ? Kuster he had a really bad hair day but he had it coming that blond , blue-eyed criminal fuck . What about these guys that tell you , I heard that . I heard that . Ah you did , did you ? Well is n't this exciting . What is this a fucking hearing test ? Did I wonder into a
zone2	nimrod I 'm standing right next to ya . I 'm going to move down here . I 'm going to move a little farther away . Blow me ! By any chance did you here that ? What about these people who tell you their needs are n't being met ? You run into this stuff ? This is support group shit . Twelve steppers . My needs are n't being met . Know what I tell them ? Drop some of your needs . Life is a zero sum game . What else is troubling me ? Mickey Mouse 's birthday being announced on the television news as if it 's an actual event . I do n't give a shit . If I cared about Mickey Mouse 's birthday I 'd have memorized it years ago and I 'd send him a card . Dear Mickey , Happy Birthday . Love , George . I do n't do that why ? I do n't give a shit . Fuck Mickey Mouse . Fuck him in the asshole with a big rubber dick . Then break it off
zone2	hope Mickey dies . I do , I hope he Goddamn dies . I hope he gets a hold of some tainted cheese and dies lonely and forgotten behind the baseboard of a soiled bathroom in a poor neighborhood with his hand in Goofy 's pants . Mickey Mouse , no wonder no one in the world takes our country serious . Do we waste valuable television time informing our citizens of the age of an imaginary rodent ! Now let me ask you this , the two pandas in the zoo do you care if they fuck ? I do n't . Why do n't they stop telling me on the news the pandas did n't fuck again this year ? I 'm not concerned . I have no emotional stake in panda fucking all right ? If they want to they will . If not they 'll watch the Price is Right . Probably the only reason they 're not doing it on time is cause some jack off from the environmental movement has moved into the cage with them . Could you get a hard on if
zone2	taking your girlfriends rectal temperature ? Leave these creatures alone . And let me get a sip of water here , hold on . All right . And as long as were talking about the news I do n't want to hear anything more about sperm egg donor surrogate invetro test tube biological adoptive foster parents who want their baby back . Baby Jane , Baby Ruth , Baby This , Baby That , Baby It 's Cold Outside , I do n't give a shit . Leave me alone and keep it off my TV . Sick American shit . I 'm also tired of hearing about innocent victims . This is an outmoded idea . There are no innocent victims . If you live on this planet you 're guilty period . Fuck you . End of report next case . Next fucking case . Next case . You 're birth certificate is proof of guilt . And what happened in this country that now suddenly everyone is walking around with their own personal bottle of water ? When did we get so thirsty in America ? Is
zone2	supply of fluids with them at all times ? Get a drink before you leave the house . Another crime against society , hyphenated names . Hey lady pick a fucking name would you please ? Pick a fucking name . Hi I 'm Emily Jericho-Fordescu . Hi I 'm George Jerk-Me-Off-Fuck-You-Too . You do n't acquire personal dignity by adding a name to your name . Feminists think it 's a radical act . It 's not . Castrating a guy in a parking lot with a Coke bottle is a radical act . Hyphenating your name is pretentious bullshit . And what is going on with all these telephone-calling plans ? MCI , AT T is this shit really necessary ? When did the phone bill become life 's most critical document ? In a country where you can buy cinnamon dental floss , cheese in a spray can and eatable women 's panties are people really breaking their balls to save nine cents on a fucking phone call ? You know ? Talking to your mother once a year might not be the most pleasant thing in
zone2	critical spending decision . Something else I do n't understand motivation tapes . Motivation books . What happened here ? Suddenly everybody needs to be motivated ? It 's a fairly simple thing . Either you want to do something or you do n't ? What 's the big mystery ? Besides if you 're motivated enough to go the store to by a motivation book are n't you motivated enough to do that so you do n't need the book ? Put it back . Tell the clerk , Fuck you . I 'm motivated . I 'm going home . I 'm going home . And can anyone explain to me the need for one hour photo finishing ? You just saw the fucking thing . How can you possibly be nostalgic about a concept like a little while ago ? Another complaint , too many vehicles . There are some families in this country own entirely too many vehicles . You see them on the highway in an RV . But that 's not enough for them . RV 's not enough . Behind them they 're
zone2	bike , Jet Ski , snow mobile , parasail , hand glider , wind surfing equipment , a hot air balloon and a small two-man deep-sea diving bell . Does n't anyone just take a fucking walk anymore ? The only thing these people lack is a lunar excursion module . Too many choices America . It 's not healthy . Another abomination , white guys over ten years of age who wear their baseball hats backwards . Listen to me . White guys let me tell you something . You 're never going to be as cool as black guys . It 's not going to happen . You 're white and you 're lame . It 's a fucking law of nature . Turning your hat around and learning a complicated handshake will not make you cool . And you black guys since you started the whole thing I 'm going to let you stay with the hats a little bit longer but I think really once you qualify for social security it 's time to spin that motherfucker around to the front of you . All right
zone2	men . The earring . The thing with the earrings . It 's over . It 's been over for a long time . Does n't mean anything anymore . It was supposed to piss off the squares . The squares are wearing them now . Does n't mean anything . It 's just fucking jewelry . Unless you have an earring with a live baby hanging from it it 's just jewelry . And I want you to know I 'm in favor of self-mutilation and personal disfigurement . I 've always said there 's nothing like puncturing and perforating your skin in a dozen or so places in order to demonstrate your high self-esteem . When I see a young man decorating his scalp with a soldering iron I say , There 's a happy guy . Thinks highly of himself . And have n't we gone a little overboard with these colored ribbons for different causes ? Every cause has it 's own colored ribbon now . Red for AIDS . Blue for child abuse . Pink for breast cancer . Green for the rain forest .
zone2	. You know what it means ? Eat shit motherfucker ! Eat shit motherfucker ! And what can we do to silence these Christian athletes who thank Jesus whenever they win , never mention his name when they lose . Not a word . You never hear them say , Jesus made me drop the ball . The good Lord tripped me up behind the line of scrimmage . According to these guys Jesus is undefeated . Meanwhile , these assholes are in last place . Must be another one of those miracles . And speaking of delusional people what about a guy who hears a voice in his head tells him to kill his entire family so he does it ? Is this the only thing a voice in the head ever tells these people to do is to kill others ? Does n't a voice ever tell a guy ? Go take a shit on the salad bar at Wendy 's . Does n't a voice ... does n't a voice tell a guy to take out his dick on the merry-go-round once in a while ? Well
zone2	but usually it 's their own idea . Something else I can do without , aftershave and cologne and this disgusting shit that men put on their bodies . Just what I need in the elevator some guy standing next to me smells like a fucking pine tree . I say , Go home and wash you smelly prick . You smell like the urinal in a Portuguese cathouse . Goddamn guys are stupid . Guys are really fucking dumb . They think they 're going to get laid with stuff you know ? Oh yeah they put it on at home . Oh boy , oh boy I 'll get laid tonight . I 'll get laid tonight . You do n't get laid with green shit that comes out of a bottle okay ? The only smell that 's going to help you get laid might be your own natural scent . You have pheromones it 's a secondary sex characteristic . People in America they 're all nervous about sex . They want to cover it up and disguise it . Guys in Europe they know how
zone2	he smells like a pile of dog shit . Those people are sophisticated . Getting pretty tired of these guys walking around in cowboy hats and cowboy boots . You ever see these jack offs ? Ca n't we kill some of these motherfuckers ? Walking around in a fucking cowboy hat . Grown men . It 's not even Halloween for Christ sakes . I say , Hey Tex grow up and get yourself a wardrobe consistent with the century you 're living in . Why do certain men feel the need to dress up as mythic figures ? You do n't see anyone walking around in a pirate costume do you ? When was the last guy you ran into had on a Viking outfit ? Make believe cowboys , closest they ever got to a cow is when they stopped to take a piss at an Arby 's . And camcorders . Here is technology gone bezerk . Everywhere you go now there 's some dick , some yo-yo , some putts with a camcorder and he is going to tape everything . Does n't anyone in
zone2	Sort of take them in . Maybe even remember them . Is that such a strange notion ? Does experience have to be documented and brought home and saved on the shelf ? And do people really watch this shit ? Are people 's lives so bankrupt they sit at home looking at things they already did ? And these guys are so intense you know ? It 's always guys they wo n't let women touch the cameras . It 's a highly technical skill . Look for a hole , push on a button , big skill and there they all think there Federico Fillini you ever see Low angles , zooms and pans and it 's the same ugly three children in every Goddamn shot . All the George Lucas magic in Hollywood is not going to change the unfortunate genetic configuration on the faces of these children . Keep these unfortunate youngsters out of public view . Now a lot of these hold on a second a lot of these cultural crimes I 've been complaining about can be blamed on the baby boomers . Something
zone2	the baby boomers . Whiney , narcissistic , self-indulgent people with a simple philosophy , Give me that it 's mine . Give me that it 's mine ! These people were given everything . Everything was handed to them and they took it all . Took it all . Sex , drugs and rock-n-roll and they stayed loaded for twenty years and had a free ride but now there staring down the barrel of middle age burn out and they do n't like it . They do n't like it so they 've turned self-righteous and they want to make things hard on younger people . They tell them to abstain from sex . Say no to drugs . As for the rock-n-roll they sold to television commercials a long time ago so they could buy pasta machines and Stairmasters and soybean futures . Soybean futures . You know something ? They 're cold , bloodless people . It 's in there slogans . It 's in there rhetoric . No pain , no gain . Just do it . Life is short play hard . Shit happens deal
zone2	from do your own thing to just say no . They went from love is all you need to whoever winds up with the most toys wins . And they went from cocaine to Rogaine . And you know something they 're still counting grams only now it 's fat grams . And the worst of it is the rest of us have to watch these commercials on TV for Levi 's loose fitting jeans and fat ass Docker pants because these degenerate yuppies boomer cocksuckers could n't keep they 're hands off the croissants and the Hagendass and their big fat asses have spread all over and they have to wear fat ass Docker pants . Fuck these boomers . Fuck these yuppies and fuck everybody now that I think about of it . Well sometimes in comedy you have to generalize . Now there 's one thing you might have noticed I do n't complain about , politicians . Everybody complains about politicians . Everybody says they suck . Well where do people think these politicians come from ? They do n't fall out of the sky .
zone2	... They come from American parents and American families , American homes , American schools , American churches , American businesses and American universities and they 're elected by American citizens . This is the best we can do folks . This is what we have to offer . It 's what our system produces . Garbage in , garbage out . If you have selfish ignorant citizens if you have selfish , ignorant citizens your going to get selfish , ignorant leaders and term limits ai n't going to do you any good you 're just going to wind up with a brand new bunch of selfish , ignorant Americans . So maybe , maybe , maybe it 's not the politicians who suck . Maybe something else sucks around here like the public . Yeah the public sucks . There 's a nice campaign slogan for somebody . The public sucks , fuck hope . Fuck hope . Because if it 's really just the fault of these politicians then where are all the other bright people of conscience ? Where are all the bright honest intelligent Americans
zone2	the way ? We do n't have people like that in this country . Everybody 's at the mall scratching his ass , picking his nose , taking his credit card out of his Fannie pack and buying a pair of sneakers with lights in them . So I have solved this little political dilemma for myself in a very simple way on Election Day I stay home . I do n't vote . Fuck them . Fuck them . I do n't vote . Two reasons ... two reasons I do n't vote . First of all , it 's meaningless . This country was bought and sold and paid for a long time ago . The shit they shuffle around every four years Does n't mean a fucking thing . And secondly I do n't vote cause I believe if you vote you have no right to complain . People like to twist that around I know they say ... they say , Well if you do n't vote you have no right to complain . But where 's the logic in that . If you vote and
zone2	office and screw everything up well you are responsible for what they have done . You caused the problem . You voted them in . You have no right to complain . I on the other hand , who did not vote , who did not vote , who in fact , did not even leave the house on Election Day am in no way responsible for what these people have done and have every right to complain as loud as I want about the mess you created that I had nothing to do with . So I know that a little later on this year you 're going to have another one of those really swell presidential elections that you like so much . You 'll enjoy yourselves . It will be a lot of fun . I 'm sure as soon as the election is over you 're country will improve immediately . As for me I 'll be home on that day doing essentially the same thing as you the only difference is when I get finished masturbating I 'm going to have a little something to

What in Tartarus have you been carrying on these shoulders ? I would n't know . I try not to overanalyze my life like some people . Some people say the unexamined life is not worth living . Those people have n't lived my life . Xena ? Two men to the left , two to the right and two behind us . All right ! Get up ! Well , messenger boy , who are you and what do you want ? We 've come to bring you to justice . This is an arrest warrant ... - ... for you . - For what ? Murder . Give me that . Does the name Thelassa mean anything to you , Xena ? Perhaps you 've killed so many people since then , you do n't remember . I remember Thalassa . Just because someone wrote that on a piece of parchment does
zone2	I did it . Well , she was crazed or , she was armed , right ? There was some sort of mitigating circumstance . Gabrielle , she was innocent . She did nothing to me and I killed her because it suited my purposes . How 's that for mitigating circumstances ? Here . What are you doing ? I 'm going back with them . You said yourself that I had the weight of the world on my shoulders . Maybe it 's the weight of my guilt . This is my chance to do something about it . Take it ! You know I 'm right . Chain her up . In the time of ancient gods , warlords and kings a land in turmoil cried out for a hero . She was Xena . A mighty princess forged in the heat of battle . The power ... The passion ... The danger ... Her courage will change the world . XENA , THE WARRIOR PRINCESS Order ! Order in this court ! Quiet ! Settle down in this court ! Silence here ! Settle down in

She seemed to glow with goodness ! And when she was gone Darkness . That 's right . We all expected greatness of her . Who knows what she might have become ... Might have done for this town had she lived ? Maybe we expected too much from her but Thalassa never disappointed us . Come on , girls . Get in there ! Move ! Here 's the deal , nice and simple You give us what we want , or we kill the girls . It was an empty threat . Look , as violent as Xena was in those days there was a line even she would n't cross . That 's what we thought . - Take me , and let the others go . - Thalassa , no ! All right . Take her . Tell her nothing , nothing
zone2	. They say you do n't kill unarmed women . There 's a first time for everything , old man . Get them out of here . - Let 's go ! - Hurry up ! No , wait ! The storage cellars are in the temple of Demeter under the altar . Very good . - Now , get out ! - Wait ! We told you where the stores are . Let her go ! I will just as soon as I know you 're telling the truth . No ! You ca n't just leave her ! They 're flesh-eaters ! When we returned , Thalassa was gone . The crabs smelling the blood ... Had torn her to pieces leaving the water red with her death . Silence ! Order ! Order in this court ! Quiet ! Settle down , there ! This was a terrible waste of a life .

Do you accept the condemnation of this court for your guilt in this matter ? I do . Then I sentence you to life imprisonment on Shark Island . And may the gods have mercy on your soul . Come on , murderer . Do n't get too close , she 's a killer . - I 'd like to say goodbye to my friend . - All right . You could have said something in your defense . There 's no defense for what I did , Gabrielle . Xena , you could have argued the greater good . Come on ! Surely what you can do outside prison will outweigh ... What ? Outweigh what ? The pain that that young girl felt as she was being eaten alive ? - Do n't ! - Gabrielle , she was like you . She had your kind of spirit and I

Hey , girls This is the woman who put me behind bars . I am so glad to see you here ... Do you know what I spent the past two years asking myself ? How can that murderin ' bitch Xena send people away to be punished ? You never had to pay for your crimes . That 's always bothered me . Then we have something in common . It 's always bothered me too . I heard you let them take you without a fight . I think that being a good girl made you soft . I wonder if you 're not right . Take her , girls ! All right , I get the point . Xena ... Some of us are n't planning to die on Shark Island . Time comes for us to leave We would n't mind having someone with your fighting

Three lashes for disobedience ! - Guards ! - After her ! Stop this ! Release the guard at once Murderer . Chain her . An altar for the souls of the dead ... Or is it just for the souls of the people you 've killed , Xena ? Well , it looks like you 've miscounted . You know , it would have been far better for you , and for me if ya had killed me . Yeah That 's right , Xena . It 's me . Your victim . Thalassa . Seeing me
zone2	A wolf , if caught in a trap , will gnaw off its own leg just to get away . I was lucky . The crabs did it for me . Bring her . Chain her like a hog ready for slaughter . I 've been watching you since you came here , Xena . At first I could n't figure out what you were up to helping people , building that silly little shrine . And then I realized what I heard about you was true . You 're trying to make up for all the evil things you 've done . How pathetic ! As if any of it could make up for what you did to me . You know , Xena ... The thought of you has haunted me every moment of my life . Do you understand what that 's like ? Yes ... I do . Throw her into the pit . You finally have the punishment you sought but it 's for a murder you did n't even commit . Do n't you just love the irony ? A healer has arrived along
zone2	him in . A girl ? Come in . Can you heal the pain or are you just a fraud like all the others ? Where does it hurt ? The fingers . This was n't removed by a healer 's knife . A healers ' knife ? No . Many knives . Many hungry , little knives . That 's enough ! Do you hear me ? That 's enough ! Get off ! Get off ! You 'll need to put the salve on twice a day . Will you do it for me ? When I come in for treatments , yes . Shall I ? This wound is so old . It should get more attention . Why do I feel like it 's still there ? Maybe you have n't accepted the loss . What would you know about loss ? A few things . You have such warmth and beauty ... I had that once , too . If you give yourself a chance you may rediscover your soul . That 's sentimental nonsense . Whatever beauty I had inside me was crushed the
zone2	evil . She took my beauty , and she mutilated my soul . What 's the matter ? I I think that I should I should probably visit the prisoners Check to make sure that their state of health is all right . You ca n't wait to serve , can you ? You should be careful . Enthusiasm like that can be dangerous for your health . I gotcha good that time . All right . Do you have to follow me around everywhere ? Commandant 's orders ! Would n't want anything to happen to her pet healer now , would we ? No , we would n't want that . Excuse me . May I borrow your broom ? Gon na sweep up a little dirt ?

Y'all be careful . Okay . The girls are gone . Now it 's time to implement the 10-day program . Now pay attention , it 's gon na go fast . First thing you do : Check your answering machine . If he has n't called yet he just has n't figured out an approach . Cardinal rule no . 1 : Do not call him . Whoever calls first loses ground . She has n't called . How come she ai n't calling ? She 's playing it cool . How can she play cool at this time ? Look here , dog . She calls , she gives you the upper hand . She do n't want that . - Go on . Make the call . - No , then I 'll lose ground
zone2	that messed up . The person who messes up calls first . That 's the rules . You can call today or be a player and call tomorrow . That way she 's had time to calm down . Right . And then when I do call she 'll know I know I was wrong . And that I cared enough to be that vulnerable . Your right , women love that shit . Vulnerability 's the big dick of emotions . - They like the big dick . - They do . He did n't call tonight . I did n't think it would happen this way . Or that my life 'd be the example for today 's lesson . Anyways y'all ready ? Here it goes . Day one . He 'll call , unless he 's a fool . If he is , you do n't want him . If he 's a good man , you 'll get a call . Miss Smith 's office . Oh , hi , Mr . Fenton . Can you hold on ? I 'll see if she is
zone2	Keith on line one . Never take the first call . Everything must be done on your time . Make him wait . Tell him I just got out of a meeting and to call back in 10 minutes . - She told me to call back . - Do n't even worry about that . She stalling for time . She disheveled . She do n't know what to do . Okay , 10 minutes . Play the game with her , you know ? Does the back of my neck look like this ? It 's now nine minutes . If he 's late , be in another meeting . Miss Smith , Keith on line one . Hello ? Fine . Discuss nothing over the phone . Be brief . Your job is to just listen . Now , remember , dog . Do n't rush in . Take your time . I got this , bro . So , how 's your day been so far ? Fine . If he takes time to feel you out , rush him . - So how 's that
zone2	do n't we meet tonight at the bistro ? - Okay , but ... - The client 's coming in . - Tonight , 7:30 , the bistro . - No , wait , hold on . I just ... She rushed me off the phone . She rushed me off the phone . You know what ? I think she did that deliberately . Did she set a date ? - How 'd you know ? - That 's the mack move . That 's definitely the mack move . - That lets me know one thing . - What ? She ai n't no amateur . Yeah , well , neither am I . - Thank you . - Sure . Arrive 15 minutes late . Keep him waiting . Waiting builds anxiety , and that 's a good thing . Remember : Your objective is to listen . Be polite and charming . This confuses them . - Hey , Keith . - Hey . Calm down , man . Look , let me ask you something first . Was she talking a lot ? If she
zone2	didn't . - She was talking , right ? Yeah . She seemed normal . If that 's talking , yes . - She seemed normal ? - Yeah , she did . She got an angle . Do this : Admit you 're wrong . - Let 's see what she 's got . - You sure ? - Have I steered you wrong ? - Yeah . One time , but you got your hair back . All right , Shant ? , I was wrong . I should n't have been with Julie . But we were working late , I got hungry she asked me if I wanted to go eat , and I was ... It does n't matter what his ass says . He should 've known better . But now that he 's offered some form of an explanation you step to the plate , girl . Be a woman . Do the right thing . Gut- punch that ass . After two drinks we were dancing , and that 's when you came in . Keith , it 's okay . You
zone2	. All right . Good . You know what ? I think we need some time apart . See what else is out there . Test the waters . " Test the waters " ? ! What the hell ? - Keith , calm down , bro . - I am calm ! You getting swollen up in the chest . Sit down , relax . Test the waters ? - I do n't want you to feel restricted . - Restricted ? And lately , I 've been feeling a little trapped myself , so maybe it 's the best thing . Is that cool with you ? Yeah , I was gon na suggest the same thing . Cool . Good . Waiter , check , please . Would you like me to take care of this ? No , I 'll pick this one up . - Are you sure ? - I 'm sure . - Thanks for dinner . - Yeah . Rule no . 3 : Break up with him before he breaks up with you . Whoever breaks up with the person first
zone2	that 's interesting . She sat there and let me humiliate myself by making me go through how sorry I was . Then she broke up with me . I should 've made her pay . - She offered to pay ? - Why ? - She 's good . - Because she picked up a check ? No , it 's about a psychological advantage . - But I paid , bro . - But she offered . - She has before . - But never after breaking up . Look , in order to grasp this , you got to think like them to read between the lines . You got to ask yourself , " When she offered to pay did she want to come up out of the pocket ? " Think about it . On a date , what woman wants to pay for the meal ? None ! Zero . I 'm 29 years old . I have n't met a woman who does . So you can safely conclude this is not about the money . So what is this about ? She
zone2	if she wanted to . This is a demonstration of her independence to you . She 's trying to tell you that you ca n't do nothing for her . You ca n't even buy her damn dinner ! She 'd starve before you come out the pocket . That 's deep . That 's some really deep shit right there . Now we know his crime . He went out to dinner with a coworker after working late had dinner , did a little dancing , got caught and now he feels bad . Actually , that 's not too bad . However if your case is worse , determine if you want your man back . If you do n't , to hell with him . Keep on stepping . But if you want him back , punish him . Cardinal rule no . 2 : When your man messes up , no matter how small it is you gots to punish him . Punish him hard . Day two . What you all think ? Prommy . - Yeah , too prommy . - No , too
zone2	right , okay . What we thinking ? Better . You need something with a little green . Like a money-green . - And spandex . - Karen ! - She know I 'm playing with her . - Stop it . - All right . What about this one ? - Better . What ? Now , see , this is a size 12 . Why did you bring me in this skinny-ass store ? - What you gon na do ? - You see that there ? I 'll sew them together , and pack all this up in there . This the front , this the back . Work it . I 'm big , beautiful and loving it . Day two and three for you are a breeze . For him , it 's hell . Keith ! Are you watching the game ? I 'm hearing , and what God says is : I 'm hearing , and what God says is : " When I show you the truth ... " If I stay out late Saturday , I attend church via TV Sunday
zone2	up ? This is Shant ? . At the beep , do your thing . This is Keith . I called you yesterday . You did n't return my call . If you 're there , pick up . If you 're there , pick up . Cool . Call me when you get in . In love and war , maintain military silence . Do n't speak or consort with the enemy . Silence is golden . You can do more with silence than speaking . What up ? This is Shant ? . At the beep , do your thing . I 'm picking up some tickets to the Lauryn Hill concert . So just let me know if you wan na go . See ? He think he 's slick . You know I love Lauryn Hill . That 's okay . I 'm going to church anyway . Like Mama said , better to get there late than not at all . Lauryn Hill . No , you did n't . No , I ca n't call . I 'm not gon na call . Called
zone2	Oh , no . Okay , all right . No . It 's you , man . Who else are you expecting , dog ? Come on , you 're not even ready . I forgot I had these briefs to prepare , so I ca n't make it today . - You 're not thinking about Shant ? ? - Come on , man . No , man . I 'm not thinking about that girl . All right . I see you later , man . Tell them I 'm sorry I could n't make it . I 'm about to be Tiger Woods . He 's still playing it cool . He 's upset , but he has things under control . His ego wo n't let him go far . So what do you do ? You break him . Push his buttons . To do this , you need a PR agent and a flunky . Okay , who 's the PR agent , and who 's the flunky ? - Hey , Trent . - Shant ? . - How you doing ? -
zone2	- Good to see you . - What 's all this ? Your PR agent should be watching you . He must be a friend of your man 's . Do n't do anything sleazy . Just be a little too friendly . You do this by holding your flunky too long and hugging him too tight . Damn ! That sure was one hell of a hug . I 'm just happy to see a Christian brother . - It 's good to see you . - I ca n't wait to holler out . Have a blessed week . - I sure will . - My brother . - Bless on , baby . - Bless . Contrary to popular belief , men are big gossipers too . They love to talk about something they done seen or know . You wo n't believe what we saw at church . What y'all see ? Trent and Shant ? was all hugged up . - Keith 's Shant ? ? - Hell , yeah . - What are you talking about ? - I know what I saw .
zone2	. That was just a Christian hug . Sometime she just feels the spirit , and she wan na spread the word . " Christian hug " , my ass . I know what a Christian hug is . When girls give you a little hug with their asses out so you got that space in case you get a little excited . You do n't want them to feel your man-man in church . But there was no gap . They was hugged up tight . Why she hugged up on him like that anyway knowing he 's the major player ? - Trent 's a player ? He go to church ! - All the players go to church . Why ? Because all the freaks go to church . I ai n't lying . Patrick , am I lying ? Am I lying ? Go to a club Saturday night . Go to church Sunday morning . I guarantee you the same hos you see on the dance floor you see Sunday morning singing in the choir . That 's real . You got the deaconess you
zone2	a player hang out in church ? Club on Saturday , how much is it to get in ? - Fifteen dollars . - Fifteen dollars . You go to church Sunday , how much ? Nigga , that shit is free ! Trust me , bro . A whole gang of players be going to church . - You might be right . - I 'm right ! Tell you right now , Trent fixing to wax that ass . When you 're gossiped about , there 's always backlash involved . But trust me , the tradeoff is worth it . Shant ? , pick up . It 's Keith . Give me a call , okay ? You 're still not in , so just give me a call . It 's me again . I 've called you eight times . I do n't know where you are . Where you at ? Where you be ? What 's up ? It 's me again . It 's 6:00 . Yeah , yeah , 6:00 . Just waiting for your call . I know you 're
zone2	. Yeah , yeah , it 's 6:00 . This is the last time I 'm calling your ass . Peace . What does she think this is ? Please . Okay , I decided to call you back . Do n't know where you are . Just call me , all right ? Shant ? , it 's 11:00 . All right . Bye-bye . It 's called tough love . Day four . The buying power of African-Americans is up 12 percent in groceries . The buying power of African-Americans is up 12 percent in groceries . It 's tapering off in alcohol largely due to special interest groups . I think we can improve if we limit our marketing and focus on after- school projects thereby helping the community . People will see us still targeting African-Americans and providing a community service . - So we 're redirecting our energies . - Exactly , Bill . We 're turning it into a positive relationship . - That 's very good . - Thanks . Well done . Look at these people . Notice anything different ? Moi
zone2	made partner . Keith should be calling any second now . - Hello ? - Keith is on line two . Good . Tell him I 'm busy . - You 've been waiting for his call . - Tell him I 'm busy . - Women . - I 'm a stinker , ai n't I ? I 'm sorry . Mr . Fenton , she 's still busy . Come on , Keith ! I know you 're in there , man . Keith ! I know you can see me , ' cause I can see you ! Come on , man . Do n't give me that look . Look into the light , Keith ! Look into the light ! I 'm coming around ! I must admit I feel sorry for Keith . I hate to see people suffer . But you know what ? You ca n't show weakness . Men only understand strength . If they do n't feel pain , there 'll be no gain . No pain , no gain . What the hell is wrong with you ? You
zone2	like you washed your ass . - Keith , what 's wrong ? - No , man . I 'm ... I think I 'm sick . - You ai n't sick , man . - No , man . I mean , I 'm sick , bro . You wan na feel my head ? I think I got the flu . You ai n't got no damn flu . No , I got ... I 'm telling you . I feel woozy . Woozy ? No , dog . You whipped . She got you laid out like a $2 crack ho . You look like you waiting on a hit . It 's sad , bro . This sad . Look at you . I 'll go call your mama . They 'll take your player card for this . I 'll see to it . You have 11 messages . That 's what I 'm talking about . By this time , he gets advice from his boys , which can get sticky . So whatever you do , do n't talk to him . Phone
zone2	be careful , he might pull a fast one on you and just come over . And then you 're in trouble . Keith . What 's going on ? Doing all right ? Okay . - I heard you were sick . - You know better . - How you feeling ? - I 'm feeling real good right now . - Did you do what I said ? - Relax . - Did you do what I said ? - Have a seat . I 'll break it down . I wo n't until you tell me if you did what I told you . I did exactly what you said . - Exactly what you told me . - Damn . I got over there about 10:00 all dressed up , looking good and suave and debonair . - Like Denzel ? - Better than Denzel . Shit , let me sit down then . Come in . So she invited me in . Walked in there all calm , cool and collected . Started to dim the lights all over . Got some soft music playing
zone2	. Sat down on the couch , looking good like chocolate H ? agen-Dazs ice cream . - With the nuts . - With the nuts . Looking all luscious and lickety . I was there to seduce . Gave her that Denzel eye thing then a little L . L . lip action . - lt was about to be on ! - So , did you hit ? - Relax , relax . - No , did you hit ? - Relax , all right ? - Come on . You hit it , right ? - Started moving in for the kill . - And then ? - She too smart for that . - Told you that . But plan B . So you had plan B ? Started an argument . Did n't matter about what . I got her yelling at me . I drew her into me emotionally . After it was over , I just ... - ... I felt so good , like jogging . - See , that 's it . The transfer of frustration from one party to the
zone2	course . - You take physics ? - Yeah . What 's the law of thermodynamic energy by Newton ? - Energy is neither lost nor destroyed . - I remember . It is transferred from one party to the next . - Right . - We all experience it . - Feeling good ? - Feeling real good now . Somebody full of negative energy leaves you feeling completely drained . - Sucks it out of you . - Transference of energy . That 's what you did . You transferred your negative energy and emotions onto her . You flipped the script . - Was I flipping it ? - You flipped it . - Women , they emotional creatures . - Preach . Once you tap into their emotions , you 're halfway there . Testify ! It does n't matter what type of emotion . I 'll beat a drum . Once those emotional floodgates are open ... - ... you 're home free . - Home free ! - They get confused . - Confused . - Bewildered . - Bewildered ! - Lethargic .
zone2	baby ! - Yeah , amen ! Hallelujah ! Hallelujah ! Will somebody please cut that damn music ? Day five is a bad day . That 's all I got ta say . Day six is a bad day , but not as bad as five . So he turned the tables on you with the transfer-of-emotion shit . I ai n't gon na lie . That shit does work . So now you got to turn the tables back on him . But until you do that , what must you do ? Occupy your damn time . Stay busy . Y'all know what I mean . So in times like these , this is what I do , ladies . I break out the old black book . While you 're thinking about him he 's having a good time not thinking about you . Tyrone . Call Tyrone . Come down low . Put it in my face . I want it to be funky . - How you doing ? - You were right , man . - I feel like my old self again
zone2	big man could move like this . How do you like that ? What 's going on ? Spin it around on me , baby . Spin it . You my own little spinning top . - What going on ? - I 'm enjoying myself . - I see you . - You see me ? - What 's going on down there ? - Turn around . I 'm glad you made it to my promotion . It 's nice to mix business with pleasure . - That 's the nipple . - I know . Business with pleasure . - Always like the pleasure of business . - I hear it . At events like this , it 's nice to have your lawyer close to you . I 'm a little tired . I 'm gon na go rest . - Tony , can I see you ? - ln a minute , baby . - Bring your ass over here . - I 'll be right back . - What 's up , dog ? - She 's trying to rape me . You say
zone2	that . Look at her . - She is fine . - I know she 's fine , man . But putting her titties on my back , grabbing my stuff ... ? Do you know how much I 'd pay to have her grab my stuff ? Plus , dog , if she was ugly I would 've told you to step off . But look at that . Dog , she bad ! Look at them titties . Nice , big old breastices . They 're just wanting you to suck on them . They 're staring . That small waist leading down to that plump ass . She shaking that ass for you , saying " , Keith , come eat me " . Put it on your chin . Plus , she got a good job , and on top of that , she a freak . You can hit that from the back . Oh , shit . Look at her . What more do you want , man ? I do n't know , man . I do n't know . If you want
zone2	other people . Why not start with that ? I 'm gon na go smack ass . I suggest you let her smack your ass . Shant ? , I really thought you forgot about me . I 'm glad you called . Day six is a real drag . You 're on a date and start to think : " What the hell am I doing here ? " Stick through it . Go on many dates . It 's all part of the 10-day process . I thought you were n't concerned about me . - I thought ... ... you avoided me . - But now I know you ca n't ... ... do without Big Papa . - Ray-Ray . - Your Pooh Bear . Day seven . - I got an announcement . - What , baby ? - I finished my 10-day program . - Oh , Lord . Bam ! - lt works ! Michael proposed , guys ! - I 'm so happy for you . - Congratulations ! - You worked it out . It 's not that I 'm not
zone2	. You ca n't be happy until you get your stuff together . So on day seven there are a few things you must do . One : Pay a visit to Victoria 's Secret . Two : Get your nails and hair done . Three : Take a long , hot bubble bath . Four : Pull out that dress that hugs and accentuates your curves . All women are beautiful and have something that works . Oh , and do n't forget about these . There 'll be no pantylines tonight . After you 've applied your makeup then you do the unthinkable : You take an unannounced trip to your man 's house . Without trust you do n't have anything . Your objective is to get in the house . Make up some excuse to bait him . - Keith . - Hey . Here 's the rest of your stuff . I 've had it in my car and wanted to drop it off . I 'm sorry it 's so late . I just needed some closure . Wan na come in so we
zone2	. - I wo n't hurt you . I mean , just a second . - I 'm gon na go . - Shant ? . Just for a second , all right ? Just ... Please . Got him . Before you know it , you 'll be with him on the couch . Allow him to caress your soft body and kiss you . Do not resist when his strong hands grab your ample behind and squeeze tight . Anything to get him where he has to have you . - Then make up an excuse and leave . - I got ta go . - Really . I got ta go . I got ta go . - No . Hell , no . I 'm sorry , I did n't mean to lead you on . I 'm not ready for this . Shant ? ! Shant ? ! Oh , shit . And that 's day seven . You 've turned the tables . Never let a woman come over your house unannounced , dog . And if you not sure you 'll hit it
zone2	a woman let you hit it , and you hit it you got the power . But if you start , and she says no , then she got the power . This is what this is about : Power . Power ? It 's about power ? You set us back . She flipped the script . I do n't care about this " flipping the script " . I 'll call her , have a conversation , start making up . No , no , no , dog . You ca n't call her . This is getting personal now . - She beginning to piss me off . - Piss you off ? This is not about a mental game between you and her . It 's about my relationship , my life . Will you stop thinking about yourself for once ? You think this is about you . Oh , no , this stopped being about you a long time ago . You 're doing this for all men in the country . You 're doing this for men around the world . Around the
zone2	every woman will think they can pull this trick . - You know how woman talk . - How ? Women are gon na be pulling these head trips . We 'll be the one's cooking dinner . We 'll be the one's changing the diapers , washing the dishes . You know what they 'll do ? Sit on our couch watching football . That 's what 's gon na happen . This is much bigger than you . Way bigger than you . You make it sound like women are like the ClA . That 's funny , though . Funny . The ClA ai n't got shit on a woman with a plan . Remember that . A turning point was actually on day seven . I went over to his house , turned him on , then left . Left him in the bed with a hard-on . You left your man with a hard-on ? Dick was hard as a rock . Just ... Damn , I do n't know if I could 've did that . See , I love dick far too much
zone2	, you do n't do it all the time . I have a policy . As many times as he can get it up , you get it back down . Girl , can I keep it real ? - Teach . - But there is a " but " . When your man 's been bad , you give him two options . Blue balls or choke that chicken . She know . She know . - Crab cakes were a hit . - Crab cakes were , were n't they ? I got ta say this . Hold up . - Showing up unannounced is a risk . - True . What if his boys were there ? Or another girl ? You want me to handle it ? Come on , Shant ? , Jr . All right . You must know your man 's cycle . All men have a sex cycle . Most men need to have sex at least once every seven days . What man she fucking ? My man is 2 , 3 , 4 times a day . So if his
zone2	tell them to leave because he 'll wan na get busy . But you 've got to get him the day before he thinks about another girl . And if he 's a good man , hello he 'll wait a week before seeing somebody else . - Right ? - Right . How did I do ? My car . I got ta run a few errands before work . - See you later . - Call me . - A week ? - What kind ... I 'm talking about maybe a day or two . Your man is weak . He 's a punk . On day eight , stock up on groceries . Pick out a bottle of wine . Once you make up with your man you may be inside for a few days . Listen up , everyone . New development . Our competitor is launching new events for their clients . Last Wednesday they had a hump day for Coca-Cola . This weekend , a pool party for Miller Genuine Draft . Normally I do n't impose weekend work , but I think
zone2	is the break that we needed . Conny invited you as her escort , right ? Go . No , go . This will be your chance to shine , your chance to emerge as the true player you really are . No , I do n't like playing games , man . I do n't ... Can I ask you something ? - Has Shant ? even called you today ? - No . Has she even thought to say : - " Just calling to see if you alive " . - No . You think she 's moping after she walked out on you ? - What are you waiting for ? - I do n't know . Pick up this phone , call Conny . Call her . Tell her you wan na go to that party . Because Shant ? , she half-stepping . And you got other options . It 's time for a man to do what a man 's got to do . Stop pining over this woman . Show her who 's the man ! Show her who 's wearing the
zone2	over her for too long . - I need get back to being the player . - Play on . I need to break out my old mack moves and show her who she dealing with . Time to show her who wears the drawers . Oh , suki-suki now . Call her . What ? What ? This is Lala . We 're partying at the Miller Draft extravaganza . How you ladies doing ? Hey ! Oh , my God , this is so nice . Thanks for inviting us . Looks like it may be worth my while . Please be on your best behavior . My boss is here . We wo n't embarrass you . I did n't mean that . This is work . Got ta check out the competition . Let 's get some drinks . Free drinks . Come on . That 's right , y'all . Here we go now . This extravaganza thing is quite a success . It 's not a bad tool . We should 've thought of it . Meet the representative of the man who did
zone2	Parker . - How are you ? Hi , Shant ? . Tell Jim I send my congratulations on this success . Will do . Oh , no , he did n't . He did n't just walk in and act like he does n't know me . This is wrong . On day nine , you 're supposed to be kicking back waiting for him to beg for forgiveness . I did n't know you knew Conny Spalding . She 's lovely . She reminds me of you . She does . Bill , could you excuse me for a second ? - Sure . - Thank you . - Thank you . - Enjoy . So , ca n't speak ? - What 's happening ? - What 's happening ? What are you doing here with Conny ? I had n't heard from you , so I took matters into my own hands . You said test the waters . Let 's just say brother 's swimming tonight . So you showed up with her knowing that I would be here ? I did n't know you
zone2	tired of your bullshit . I 'm a good man . It 's time for me to explore my options . - Keith , hon , let 's dance . - Option no . 1 . " Hon " ? Conny , may I speak to you for a second ? - Sure . - Thanks . - What are you doing ? - What do you mean ? What are you doing with Keith ? He 's my man . He 's not acting like your man . He would if did n't have a little hooch running behind him . I do n't appreciate that . Why are you calling me names ? It 's a little junior high . Keith is here because he wants to be . I did n't force him . It 's his decision , so do n't take your man frustrations out on me . Okay ? No , she did n't . No , this trick-ass bitch did not just go there . But you know what ? She 's right . When your man messes up , deal with him
zone2	two women fighting over a man . Not ladylike . But you know what ? I do n't like this bitch . That 's what I 'm talking about . Work it out . Okay , I admit . That 's not how you handle it . Back it up . This is how you really handle it . Keith is here because he wants to be . I did n't force him . It 's his decision , so do n't take your man frustrations out on me . Okay ? Get it together . - We need you over here . - I 'll be right there . Come here for a minute . Can you keep him occupied till I get back ? - How you ladies doing ? - Fine . - Tony ? - Yeah ? - Give me a hand with this . - Yeah . These are Miller girls . My man , Tony . - Which one you want ? - Give me Snowflake . Then I 'm Frosty . Snowflake , do n't get too close . You might melt .
zone2	us you were having problems ? You let him act a fool in front of you like that ? Yo , Keith . Spotlight 's on you , dog . - She looking ? - Check it out . - You want me to handle this ? - Breaking it down . I 'm breaking her down ? Want me to handle this for you ? - I 'd just break down and cry . - You want me to yank his ass ? I do n't care . I 'll straight yank his ass . You want me to ? - What are you gon na do ? - What you doing , bitch ? See why you do n't tell your girlfriends ? They 'll heighten the situation by panicking , and you will too . You want me to yank his ass ? No , Diedre . It 's okay . I will pull jack moves on that fool . I done fought fools way bigger . No , Diedre , it 's okay . I 'll handle it . I got the situation under control .
zone2	fun . No , we 'll have none of that . No ! They do n't know Diedre fear . Once again , if you do n't want your man back to hell with him . Keep on stepping . But if you want him back and behaved you must do some strange things . Excuse me , ladies . I 'll be right back . Pay attention , this 'll go fast . One : lntensify your game by finding a man . A fine one . But you need to recruit him quickly . Where is it ? Oh , right here . Great . Desperate times call for desperate measures . Yes . The old damsel-in-distress trick . Works every time .

Does n't matter what he 's doing . Direct your attention to him . Does n't matter what he says . Be attentive . Laugh at his jokes . Act like you are having a ball . I said " , Who do you think I am

If you walk out that door with him I 'm going home with Conny . If you feel you have to control me by going home with Conny go right ahead . Do what you got ta do . But no matter what you decide , I 'm walking out that door . Got ta go . You 're taking a gamble . He might sleep with Conny . But my guess is he wo n't .

I was just putting the moves on this fine-ass man . And he did not even

You think so ? Yes . Do you like basketball ? Yes . Do you find me attractive ? - Yes . - Do you think I find you attractive ? Yes . Can I just ask you one more ? Think a woman who thought she 'd control her man with rules could get him to come back ? No . Unless he really loves her . Like to dance ? You did n't answer my question . I had to cut loose for a second . Gon na tear it up . Come on , cheer up ! Call . Damn ! Work the chocolate . Michael ! You like that . - That 's right . - Loser . Memories ! Can you smack ass on film ? - She sleep with you the first night ? - Yes . That was different ,
zone2	Do n't think God gave me this gap for nothing . Why you stare at my face ? I know about women . I got a mama , nine sisters , and a cat . - I got that man . - The plan works . You ca n't even put the finger in the ass , make her holler . You ca n't make her drop it .

They think they may have been eaten off ... by a human . - Where in New Jersey ? - Just outside Atlantic City . Not an uncommon place to lose a body part . They think it 's the Mob ? He was a homeless man . There 's no motive . You feeling lucky , Scully ? Relative to whom ? It 's not our case , Mulder . The local police are handling it . An X-File ? Ever hear of something called the Jersey Devil ? A beast that 's supposed to come out of the woods and attack cars , like an East Coast Bigfoot . Read the file about the case in 1947 . Save me the trouble . 1947 . Family watches Dad get dragged off into the woods . Cops find Dad with a few appendages gnawed off . Cops corner a large , naked man in

The original disappeared from the files after the incident . - There is a statement from the pathologist . - l 've heard this story since I was a kid . - lt 's a folk tale , a myth . - l heard the same story when I was a kid , too . Funny thing is , I believed it . Thanks , Doreen . Fact is , we 've got a cannibalised body in New Jersey . Someone or something out there is hungry . They say animals can develop an appetite for human flesh , but ... this is no animal . See the teeth marks , just below the clavicle ? They 're human . - Who found the body ? - A park ranger . Was he alive when it happened ? It 's hard to tell . There 's no sign of a struggle . His blood alcohol level was up . - Probably never knew what

I do n't remember anybody calling the fbi in on this . We 're not here officially . Agent Scully is a medical doctor . We heard about your victim and thought we 'd look . I 'm sorry . I 'm going to ask you to leave . - We have an investigation . - Tommy , this is no time to get pissy . - We have jurisdiction here . - Any suspects yet ? I do n't work for you , sir . Unless you hear from the attorney general , this is a local matter . - Agent Mulder , we should go . - No need to get bent out of shape ! On the contrary , I think I 've been exceedingly polite . - So what 's eating that guy ? - He was perfectly in his rights . The fbi has
zone2	feel the same if someone horned in on your work . Chances are , he 'll be scratching his head when they bring the next body in . You could have really humiliated him and told him who the perpetrator was . The Jersey Devil . What do you say we grab a hotel , take in a floor show , drop quarters in the slot , do a little digging on this case . - You 're kidding ? - OK , skip the floor show . - Mulder , I have to be back in DC . - Have you got a date ? No . I have my godson 's birthday party at 6.30 . - What are you doing ? - A little poking around . - Maybe make a weekend out of it . - lt 's a three-hour drive back by myself . In Friday night traffic . Change of fifty . I found the body just over there , lying face down on the rocks . 32 years with the Parks Service , I 've seen some weird stuff , but never anything
zone2	You get many wandering around ? Well , occasionally , you 'll see some , but ... most are scared of the woods . Scared ? Of what ? I do n't know . The devil . - People say that 's just a myth . - Depends on who you talk to . What do you think ? Well , like I said , 32 years , I see a lot of weird stuff . Like one time , a little over four years ago , I saw what I thought was a large man come out of a copse of birch trees . Not a stitch of clothing . He was about sixty yards away . And he starts sniffing the air , you know , like a dog . And then he looked straight at me , and I swear he smelled me , because he took off into the woods so fast you 'd swear he was n't human . Really ? - You never saw him again ? - No . But I feel him . And ... I 've found things . Some scat
zone2	human . Found a half-eaten rabbit with what looked like a human cuspid tooth , and deer bones , looked like they 'd been sharpened into tools . You think it 's responsible for the body you found ? Well ... I got a pension coming up in a few years . You know , you say the wrong thing ... I 'll tell you one thing . I do n't ever come out here without my weapon any more . How far is it into town from here ? About a mile , a mile and a half .

I do n't think I 'm cut out for this , El . You went to the fbi Academy . What better training for motherhood ? Seriously . You 're great with kids . What do you mean ? - When do I find the time ? - First you have to get a life . Of course , it helps if you can find a man . - Know of any ? - They 're disappearing faster than the Brazilian rainforest . - What about that guy you work with ? - Mulder ? - l thought you said he was cute . - He 's ajerk . He 's not ajerk . He 's ... He 's obsessed with his work . Hi . I 'm Rob . Scott 's dad . - Oh ! Come in . - Thanks .

Did you know Roger Crockett ? Did you hear how he died ? Yeah . Any ideas who might have done it ? You a cop ? No , I 'm fbi . I 'll show you something . OK . I need some money . - What is this ? - Stuck in the pocket of ajacket I found . Does it mean anything to you ? - l 've seen it . - Where ? - Right here , digging in the trash . - Here ? Are you hustling me ? Swear to God . - What do you think it is ? - l do n't know .

Sir ? - You got a man up on that roof . - Nothing to be afraid of . - We can give you a warm place to sleep it off . - Hey ! Back off ! - There 's a man up on that roof ! - Get in the car ! Now ! - What the hell are you doing ? ! - Enjoying the nightlife here in Atlantic City . I 'll go right to the DA 's office if I have to . - Obstructing an investigation . Misconduct . - Let 's go see her together . - We could add " withholding evidence " . - What are you talking about ? Statements given to you describing something stalking the city . This is the fishing trip they get me up at three in the morning for ? Unbelievable ! Why else would you be sweeping the streets tonight ? You know it 's out there . I got a perpetrator out there
zone2	, I 've got ajob to protect people . is that your_job ? Or is it to keep the dice rolling ? The tour buses rolling in ? You ca n't fill those casinos , this town disappears like a quarter down the slot . I 've seen it . Seen what ? You 've been spending too much time in supermarket checkout lines . That story 's as old as the hills . Who 's gon na be responsible when you lose your first tourist , Detective ? - You are . - No , you are , sir . Because you 're wasting my time and impeding the solution of this case . You wan na go on a safari , go to Africa . In the meantime , enjoy the rest of your weekend . Agent Scully ! Agent Mulder , line three . Where are you ? - Not far from where you left me . - You 're still in Atlantic City ? Scully , you got anything happening this morning ? What 's that noise in the background ? - That 's a guy
zone2	The drunk tank ? It 's not hard to see why they mistook you for a vagrant . Are you gon na rag on me or take me to get something to eat ? Am I buying ? Or did you manage to panhandle some change while you were at it ? It moved like a cat . Quick and graceful . There 's no way a human could 've gotten up on the roof that fast . - Mulder ... - What ? What happens when word gets back to the Bureau ? They dropped the charges . Thompson did it to spite me . - l 'm talking about this Jersey Devil . - lt 's exactly like the ranger described . The way it moved , sniffed the air ... - lt 's probably in search of food . - Yeah , I 'll say ! It was in the garbage . If it was a man-eater , why did n't it go for me ? - lt probably felt threatened . - You 've already given it a motive and alibi . It chewed somebody 's
zone2	do believe I saw something ? - You saw something , I 'll give you that . But I 'm not about to go in and sell a sighting in a dark alley . - l 've still got a hotel room I 'm paying for . - l have to get back to Washington by 7.30 . - Got another birthday party ? - No . I have a date . Can you cancel ? Unlike you , Mulder ... I would like to have a life . I have a life . Come on . I have somebody I want you to meet on the way home . Come on . Hold on . Just about every culture has one . Yeti , Sasquatch , Just about every culture has one . Yeti , Sasquatch , Russian almas , sonnequat . - Why is that ? - lt 's a universal wild-man myth . A fear of our dual natures as humans , as creators of life and destroyers of it . - What 's this chart ? - lt shows the historic entry of man onto each
zone2	which , as you see , has been disastrous . - Why ? We humans have retained hereditary traits that have proven to be extremely destructive . We tend to be tribal , aggressively territorial , oriented by selfish sexual and reproductive drives that make co-operation beyond the family or tribe extremely hard for us . We kill other species in order to survive ? Humans sit at the top of the food chain , and we reduce other species ' chances of survival . I 'm glad Dana left here with more than a degree ! What if something entered the food chain above us ? It wo n't happen . Our intelligence virtually ensures that , barring the introduction of alien life , we will live our days as rulers of the world . But what if , by some fluke of nature , a human was born who reverted to its most animal instincts ? A carnivorous Neanderthal . Would n't he be above us on the food chain ? Sure . All he 'd have to do is wait outside any fast-food restaurant and eat us
zone2	of men raised in the wilderness by animals who have no language and hunt like predators ? Several . But cannibalism is rare . - Even among the lower mammals . - When faced with extinction ? Maybe in the jungles of New Guinea ... lt 's highly unlikely that what you 're suggesting could have survived in the woods of New Jersey . Highly unlikely , but not outside the realm of extreme possibility ? Well , it would be an amazing discovery . The hard thing was when my wife remarried . I felt very competitive for my son 's attention . - lt was weird . - l 'm sure . I became a superdad on the weekends with Scott . I had this unconscious fear of being replaced . I had dreams where l was running over his stepfather with my car . You 'll understand when you have kids . They change everything . That 's what they say . Maybe some weekend we could take the kids to the beach . - Yeah ! - Great . Thank you . Can I ask about
zone2	say ? I do n't think it 's a case we should discuss over dinner . I do n't suppose you want to hear about the finer points of estate planning and taxation ? Mulder . This is Peter Brullet of the Jersey Parks Department . Oh , yeah . Hi . I found a body out in the woods today , looks like it 's been dead six to eight months . A long-haired male , missing the same tooth I found in that rabbit . - Could be your devil . - Where 's the body now ? - With the coroner 's office . - You 're sure it was a male ? It had all the plumbing . Excuse me . I 'm sorry . Excuse me . - Scully . - Mulder . - Sorry to interrupt your evening . - That 's OK . What 's up ? I just had an amazing thought . Maybe it is n't a beast man we 're looking for , after all . If they picked it up , nobody logged the body on the chart .
zone2	they have done with it ? We may have called you for nothing . - They 're trying to sweep it under the carpet . - Why ? Any publicity , and the streets are crawling with people who are n't playing crap tables . Word gets out it 's on the loose , forget it . - You said it was a female ? - The body was a male . There 's a chance there was a mate . We have to find out . What are the chances of capturing it alive ? If it is a primate , it would have a natural fear of heights . It would also want to stay close to its food source . This thing has no fear of heights . We 'll stay together and start with the lower floors . - How much time will that dart give us ? - lt 'll put down a bear for an hour . If I hit it . - What 's a park-ranger vehicle doing here ? - l do n't know . Check it out . Run a check
zone2	blood . She could be bringing her killing here . She could be injured . Roger . Zebra Team in position . What if it is a female , Scully ? How close is she to you or me ? Does she feel emotion ? Or are her days just spent ... looking for food ? Maybe she spends her day shopping . Eight million years out of Africa . We 're not all that different . We 've put men into space . Built computers that work faster than the human mind . While we overpopulate the world and create new technologies to kill each other with . Maybe we 're just beasts with big brains . What ? No , I was just ... thinking about my godson 's birthday party . Eight little six-year-old boys running around . Talk about primitive behaviour ! Mulder . He 's a federal agent . Ever hear of him ? No . - You know him ? - No . - What are you doing here ? - l 'm a professor of anthropology . Mulder . That sound familiar ?
zone2	. I want this place searched top to bottom . Move ! Move ! Mulder ! Mulder , where are you ? Mulder ? ! Scully ! Lay back . Mulder , you 're hurt ! You should have seen her . She was beautiful . She just about ripped your lungs out . She could have torn my head off , but she did n't cos she sensed I was n't a threat . I need federal jurisdiction on this case . Mulder ! - How old would you say she was ? - The assistant DA 's on the phone . - He wants to know what the hell is going on . - Tell him he 's got a Neanderthal on the loose . - She was young . - The Crime Unit has filed a complaint that we 're endangering a murder investigation . - That is such crap . - They 've got her cornered in a building . - Can you see it ? - lt crawled into the wall . - Can you get a man in there ? - Affirmative . -
zone2	alive ! What 's going on in there ? I 've got a man down ! A naked woman jumped from the second storey ! Suspect is headed south into the woods on foot ! I know these woods . She 'll be down by the rocks . Look . Can you reach her from here ? I can try . It tried to take my arm off . Why did you have to kill her ? Same reason you kill a rabid animal . Hi . This just came through . It 's a posthumous medical exam of the woman 's body . They found fragments of human bones still in her digestive tract . They estimated her age to be 25 to 30 years . Now , they allowed Dr Diamond to do a medical exam of the body , but he found nothing that suggested prehistoric bone structure or physiology . Now , the ACPD has her listed as a Jane Doe . A search for her identity in state psychiatric records has begun in earnest . - Good luck . - They have also released the
zone2	His age is estimated to be about 40 years . There would have been offspring . The medical exam of the woman 's uterus does indicate that she may have given birth . She was just protecting her children . It all makes sense . The male dies and she comes out in search of food . Mulder , do me a favour . Go and have a beer . Take the day off . I 'll cover for you . Just take some time for yourself . I 've got an appointment at the Smithsonian with an ethno-biologist . Mulder . Yeah , just a second . lt 's for you . - Hello ? - Hi , Dana . lt 's Rob . Oh , hi . Sorry to call you at work , but I have Scott for the night and we have tickets for Cirque de Soleil . We thought you and Trent could join us . Requisition for a car , please . Thank you . Who was that on the phone ? - A guy . - A guy ? Same guy you had
zone2	gon na have dinner with him again ? - l do n't think so . - No interest ? - Not at this time . - Thanks , Fran . - What are you doing ? - Going with you to the Smithsonian . - Do n't you have a life , Scully ? - l 'll hurt you like that beast woman . Eight million years out of Africa . And look who 's holding the door . - Dad , did you just see something ? - Where ? - Over there . - l 'm sure it was nothing . - No , I saw something . - Ever hear the story of the Jersey Devil ? When I was a kid , my dad used to tell this story about a creature who lived out in the woods . It was half-man , half-animal . I used to believe that story .

I declare [Ned] the winner ! Bets are in . So , are we square ? Course we are , you mad bugger . Come here ! Thank Christ for that ! Could it be possible that the Kellys were finally getting ahead ? That I could actually better meself ? Steady . Excuse me . You there . - Would you mind coming and holding my horse 's thing ? - [All] right . Steady . Now , what thing are you talkin ' about , ma'am ? Are you gon na help me or not ? I 've been riding him pretty hard the last two days . Poor thing 's been holding on since Saturday . His bladder 's paralyzed with the colic . - Good God . - Have you got that ? - Right there . Good . Good . - Just hold it there

A waste of damn money . Fetch my rifle , please . What ? You ca n't just shoot a horse ' cause it 's wild . - What else can we do ? We ca n't keep it here . - Why do n't you set it free ? I could break that horse for you if you like . I 've broken horses before . You can ask around . I 'd like to give it a try , at least . We know there 's not much point . The

He said what a lucky fellow I am to be with such a beauty as you . Too lucky , if you ask me . Oh , hello , [Kate] . I did n't see you there . - Fancy seeing you here . - I 'm just having a swift pint after work . It 's not like I 'm a regular or anything . A man needs to relax after a hard day 's work . What would you know about a hard day 's work ? Sleeping and drinking and beating ' up yellow fellows is all you ever seem to do . That 's not fair , now . I 'm only doing me job . I get along with everybody . Everybody gets along with me . - Can I buy you a drink ? - No , thank you . I

[Kate] . Right . This one 's a request from [Ned] Kelly . Right . Follow me , lads . One , two . The nerve of the bloody knacker . Look at him . Acts as if he owns the place . Come here and dance with your sister ! Come on ! That fella needs taking down a peg or two , that 's for sure .
zone2	? The biggest thieves and liars the sun ever shone on . The Victorian police . Well , I 'm telling you something now , boys . I 'm not gon na let these bloody maggots put one over on me . To change a horse 's brand is easy , easier than you 'd think . You just pluck the little hairs and prick the skin with iodine . A " C " or an " O " can become a " Q . " " Q " for " Quinn " ... me mother 's maiden name . Who 's that at this hour of the night ? - [Dan] , is [Kate] in ? - Yeah , she is . Well , would you mind telling her I 'd like a word , please ? In private , like . No , I wo n't . She wants nothing to do with you . You know that full well . Well , I 'd like to hear that from her , if you do n't mind . Fitzpatrick , you 've already heard that from her many

I know it was , and I have a warrant for you . [Ned] and all . I 've warrants for both of ya . I do n't suppose I could see them warrants , could I ? There 's your warrants . Hmm ? There 's your warrants . Oh , hello . I just came down to find my riding jacket . I thought I left it here somewhere . I have n't seen it . I was sure it was here . If I find it , I 'll be sure to bring it up to the house for ya . - [All] right then . - Right . - You 're from England ? - Yes . Surrey , actually . You 're Irish ? Yeah . Me da was from Tipperary , but I was born here . I 've never

Yeah . - How are you tonight ? - Fine . Till you showed up . Drink , boys ? - [Steve] ? - I do n't drink with coppers . Aye . There 's no need for that . So I 'm leaving here tomorrow . The work here for me is finished now . Yes . I know . So I wo n't be seeing you any more . You sure you do n't want to have a better look for that riding jacket ? No . I ... I must have left it in the house somewhere . Well , it was nice to have met you . I really should go . I think you 're the most beautiful woman I 've ever seen . - You do n't have any warrants at all , do you ? - Oh , I do
zone2	believe this . You just plain thick or what ? Come on , [Kate] . I 'm just having a bit of fun , you know . Now , let 's see those bloody warrants . I 've split me head open ! You bastards ! - It 's your hand , you bloody idiot . - Hey , Fitzpatrick . - Bottom rung on top now , huh ? - Shoot him . - Do n't , [Dan] . - Give him back his bloody gun . Go on ! Get ! I 'll be back for ya , ya bastards . Can you believe the brass neck on that idiot ? Trying to be all friendly with the grog . Yeah . He seemed sobered up when you pointed the gun at him . - See his face ? - I 'm glad you think this is all very funny . - Where have you been ? - Never mind where I 've been . - What 's happened ? - Fitzpatrick could n't hold his brandy and lemonade . - What are you talking about ? -
zone2	? Why ? - He said he had warrants for me and you . - What warrants ? - Horse stealing , but there was a load of shite in it . - Whether it was or was n't , there 's trouble now either way . - You ca n't take that seriously . How can you stand there and act like this is one big joke , after all the trouble ... we 've had with coppers in this family ? - What are you thinking , [Joe] ? - You and [Dan] ought a clear out for a day or two ... just to be safe . God willing , it 'll all blow over . What the hell happened to you ? - [Ned] Kelly shot me . - He what ? Take your rotten hands off me , you bastard ! - Get off her ! - You 're under arrest ! I 'm taking you to the cells ! You filthy bastards ! [Ned] ! [Ned] ! - [Ned] . Jesus , [Ned] , they 've arrested [Ma] . - They what ? Yeah
zone2	her with attempted murder . - Attempted murder ? - And Fitzpatrick 's saying you took a shot at him . - I was n't even there . - We know that , but it 's your word against his . Take the word of a drunken liar and arrest an innocent woman ? Is that right ? I wo n't take this injustice ! I 'm gon na kill him ! I swear I 'll scatter his blood and brains like rain ! - [Ned] ! [Ned] ! No ! - Stand aside ! - No , [Ned] ! Do n't make this worse for [Ma] ! - Stop it , [Ned] ! Take the children inside , please . - What are you doing here ? - They arrested me ma . - What for ? - The copper says I tried to kill him . Why ? ' Cause he 's a bastard liar , like all coppers . That 's why . The thing is , I was n't even there . I was here with you . You could tell the truth , show the
zone2	And then they 'd have to release me ma . - That 's impossible . I could n't . Do you realize what that would mean ? Yes . I ca n't . I 'd be disgraced . He 'd take away my children , and ... It 's all right . I understand . - [Ned] . - Go ahead . Go ahead . Right . I made them an offer at the outset : Charge me and let me mother go . The answer came back : " We do n't bargain with outlaws . We 'll catch you anyway . " You see those stretchers ? You know what they 're for ? The bastards ai n't plannin ' on takin ' prisoners , that 's for sure . There 's another party down past the neck of Bullock Creek . Four of_'em . They 've hemmed us in on either side , whether they know it or not . We 'll come back at dawn , hold up these two , take their guns and horses . At least then we 'll have a chance of
zone2	arms ! Christ , it 's Lonigan , [Ned] . You 've killed Lonigan . Do you want marmalade , [Ned] ? Are you gon na kill me or what ? I 'll leave the force first thing tomorrow morning . I swear it on me mother 's life . [Ned] . - Jesus Christ . - Do as I said , and no one will get shot . Sergeant , you 'd better surrender . You 're surrounded . You been into the whisky again , you old sod ? - Get some toast on , Lonigan . - Lonigan 's gone , and you two 'll be next ... If you do n't get off them damn horses . Oh , Christ ! Give it up , man ! It 's over ! Will you stop running ? I wo n't shoot you . I swear . Why did n't you surrender ? I would n't have shot ya . I ca n't breathe ! - No ! I ca n't breathe ! - Right , right , right . Listen . It 's okay . I ca

I 'm sorry I shot you . I do n't wan na ... I got a wife and two children . What are they gon na do without me ? What are they gon na do without ... - No ! - Look at me . Look at me . God forgive me ! God forgive me . I do n't know why I took his watch . It was something to do with him not needing it . Later , I thought about sending it to his family . But by then , the papers had me down as some sort of monster ... so I thought , " No point now . I 'm damned anyway . " Is it true what they 've been saying about the three coppers ? Yeah , it 's true
zone2	, [Ma] . Better them than [Ned] . They 'll kill him now . They 'll kill him for sure . Do n't shoot , lad . I 'm unarmed . Come on . Put that away . There are n't any troops . Aw . - You 're bloody chirpy for this hour of the morning . - Got ta keep your voice down . - I 've a visitor . - Who ? - Mary Hegarty . - Mary Hegarty ! - Mm . - Jesus . She can be only 13 . I 'm not superstitious . Well , well , well , well , well . I 've never met a man whose lies are worth ? 2,000 before , especially not Irishmen . - It 's ? 6,000 . - Is that what it 's up to ? My cock alone 's worth more than that . I could do with the money meself . I 'd build a shed out the back , buy a few horses . In fact , I could buy half of Beechworth with all that . - That 's

They said I 'd lost what it meant to be human . Maybe I never had it in the first place . But was n't this about protecting the one's I loved ... the one's who gave me food and shelter , even the clothes on me back . And therefore , was n't it now a war ? [Dan] , you see that wooden gate ? Around the back there is their living quarters . If anyone 's there , you keep ' em there . - Can I help you ? - Yes , you can . Me name 's Edward Kelly . - His mates call him [Ned] . - [Ned] Kelly ? - I 'm sure I 've heard that name somewhere bef ... - I 'm sure you have , sir . Stay where you are . What do you think you 're doing ? Who are you ? Going to a

Me and Fanny used to go to school together . [Steve] . Hello , kiddies . - You 're [Ned] Kelly . - That 's right . What are you going to do with us ? You 're coming with us to Faithfulls Creek . We ca n't leave anyone behind ... to raise the alarm , now , can we ? Mr Kelly , we are supposed to be attending a funeral today . As you can see , I 'm dressed in mourning wear . Obviously unsuitable for a woman travelling in the countryside , hostage or not . - Even a blackguard like yourself ... - Susan ! I do apologize for my wife 's behaviour . There is no need to apologize on my account , Charles . The man is wearing a magenta cravat ,
zone2	arrived from Melbourne . L'eau du Nil silk . Well , you 'd better put it on then . Go on . [Joe] , you should follow her , make sure she does n't signal from the windows with her bloomers . - How dare you ! - Sure . I 'm doing no harm . What are these , these skulls ? - I collect them . - Hello . So you 're [Joe] Byrne ? The papers say you have the facial features of a creature born to crime . I 'm the handsome one in the bunch . They also said you married a Spanish housemaid in Diniliquin with the exotic name of Madela . We were just good friends . Mm . I suppose you have a lot of good friends . I 'm sure there 's no harm in being friendly . No , I do n't suppose there is . Oh , you 're a beast ... an absolute beast . She 's taking an awfully long time . He just fell off the other side right into a puddle . - You 'll

That 's like one kid every year . Hey , [Ned] . Look at this . Mortgages . One of_'em 's for old man Wick 's place . - I recognize a couple of the others too . - They 're of no use to you . They 're the only records I have of the bank 's debtors . Can I have them back , please ? No . So I killed their policeman , and I robbed their bank ... but burning their mortgages ... well , that was destroying Crown property . It was like slappin ' Queen Victoria herself across the face . So they send in [Hare] , Superintendent Francis [Hare] ... late of Cape Town , South Africa . And was n't this the challenge of your whole life , Superintendent ? A feather in your cap . You ca n't catch me .
zone2	so you take my friends instead . Over a hundred men arrested , stuck in stinkin'cells without trial ... while their crops perish in the fields . And guess what . Not one of_'em caves in and tries to claim the reward ... not one of_'em . They loved mejust the same and hated you all the more , did n't they ? Did you really think I was gon na let ' em all rot ? Two and a half thousand pounds . There 's enough to pay rent on the leaseholds for lads in jail . Thomas , you can take what you need for your mother to pay off her debt to McTeague . - Thanks , [Ned] . - And there 's some for McKinleys and Bill Skilling ... whatever he needs for his da . Have you heard anything about me ma ? They set a trial at the end of last month . She 's been given three years hard labour . I 'm sorry , [Ned] . I say , give me that back . That blackguard just stole my watch . -
zone2	- Give him back his watch . - What ? - You heard what I said . I said , give him back his damn watch . Have you gone simple all of a sudden ? We 're robbing the bank . Listen here , kid . This is the last time I tell ya ... Give him back his damn watch . You 're not innocent men . You 're a bunch of common criminals . Did you hear that ? If we act like common thieves , that 's just what they 'll call us . My mother is rotting away in a prison cell ... because of the lies of a policeman named Fitzpatrick . She 's an innocent woman , and so are these boys here . My Irish brethren have been unlawfully imprisoned ... and blacklisted from their selections . How do you expect me to behave other than to stand up against this treatment ? Any one of you here can take a shot at me and not be charged for it . There 's me gun . Any of you feeling brave enough
zone2	thought . So if I can beg your patience , this is my statement ... to the Premier of Victoria , Graham Berry ... and you here are my witnesses . [Joe] , take out a pen and paper . We 'll write ourselves a letter . Dear Sir ... Dear Sir ... " Dear Sir ... " I wish to acquaint you with some of the occurrences ... " of the present , past and future . It will pay government to give those people who are suffering ... " ... justice and liberty . " ... justice and liberty . " I seek revenge for the evil name given me and my relations . By the light that shines , this is my warning . " My brother and sisters and mother ... have to put up with the brutal and cowardly conduct of a parcel of ... - " ... big , ugly ...

This section here you might find less amusing , Superintendent . I give fair warning to all those who have reason to fear me ... not to attempt to reside in Victoria . Neglect this and abide by the consequences ... which shall be worse than than the rust in the wheat . I do not wish to give this order full force without timely warning ... but I am a widow 's son outlawed ... and my orders must be obeyed . Hey ! Look ! It 's [Ned] Kelly . - Look ! - Oh , my God . It 's [Ned] Kelly and [Joe] Byrne . Can I get a kiss then ? Of course you can . And a ladies ' man , eh ? Where will you go , [Ned] ? The country belongs to us . And we 'll go wherever we like . I hear you 're planning on getting married , starting a family .
zone2	Lack of cooperation will make it very hard for me ... to get you out of here and back to that girl of yours . I got nothing to tell you . I do n't need to tell you about the reward out . It 's a lot of money . You could put it to good use . You 're a friend of Joseph Byrne , are n't you ? You 've known each other since childhood ... served time together , is n't that right ? Aaron , it 's the Kellys we want . We do n't care about [Joe] . If we let this run its course ... he 'll be shot down like the others . The only chance your friend will have ... depends on you . If you 'll help me with this ... I 'll guarantee his safety . [Ned] ! Jesus Christ . Come on . Let 's go . Sir . They 've poisoned it . Lying low , living in caves , you get to learn sometimes . Eventually , you can read soils and rocks like books .

Can you help ... to scrub my back ? I ca n't reach . Where 's your husband ? Out looking for you , like the rest of the country . You took a risk coming here . Well , turn me in so . - You think God 'll forgive us for what we 've done , [Ned] ? - I do n't know . I suppose we 're all gon na find out one day . Just thinking of [Ma] rotting ' away in that cell . Where do you think Da is , heaven or hell ? No . He would n't be in hell , you know . He was n't such a bad fella . He ...

Of course we are , you little gorn , you . You 're just gon na keep running , are n't you ? They 'll catch you eventually ... or shoot you down . Did you know they pardoned Frank Gardiner in New South Wales ? On condition he left the colony . - He gave himself in . - He was n't an Irishman . Then why do n't you just leave the county now , try for a new life somewhere in Queensland ? No . I ca n't . It 's not about me . You know there 's more to it than that . What would it take to make you save yourself , [Ned] ? Hmm ? My husband 's best stallion ? Take it . It 's yours . Forget the mares . - More than that . Much more . - What then ? The
zone2	you atop of it , beside me . For that you 'd save yourself , leave your friends behind ? And you your children . Look . You and me had no business with one another in the first place , did we ? Was n't that the whole point of it ? Do n't make me grieve for you . I ai n't dead yet . Rebel ! - [Kate] . It 's all right ! It 's us ! - Oh ... Oh , you bloody swine ! It 's [Ned] . I know . Come here . - Oh , my God . - Now , Gracie , look at you . You 've grown too much . Give us a cuddle . Come on . Rebel , come on . Come on . So ... I saw that rascal Aaron Sherritt the other night . Oh , yeah ? And what did you give him ? Nothing , you little scoundrel . - Hmm . - The thing is , I saw him talking to this fella ... all friendly like on the way out .
zone2	all sorts of questions about you . Such as ? When did I see you last and where you were now ... that sorta thing . - Is he a copper , do you think ? - I do n't know . Well , it could 've been nothing . I just thought you ought to know , like . Thanks , Maggie . Hello , Aaron . [Joe] ? [Ned] . So how 's things , Aaron ? Not so bad . Well ... not too bad . I 've been reading a lot about you , [Ned] . You 're a real terror altogether , are n't you ? We 've been meaning to talk to you , Aaron . We were wondering if you 'd consider acting as a scout for us . We 're heading into Beechworth to rob a bank there . A scout ? Well , I 'm flattered you 'd think of me , lads , but , uh ... - You 're not interested ? - No . I-I 'd love to . If it was just up to me , I

Oh , thanks . Thanks . - How are [Dan] and [Steve] ? - They 're fine . Say hello to them for me , will you ? We will . Well , I 'd best get back to the party . Mary will be wondering where I got to .

They have outrun us before , gentlemen . Do not allow them to do so again . Do n't you worry , sir . We 'll show the bloody animals . We 'll blow ' em all to kingdom come . These are not animals , Constable . These are men who have been glorified as the leaders of a movement ... a movement that threatens the stability of an entire country . Underestimate them , and it will be you who will be blown to kingdom come . They say the trouble with the Irish ... is that they rely too much on dreams ... and not enough on gunpowder .

zone2	3265140 THE GOLDEN COMPASS There are many universes and many earths , parallel to each other . Worlds like yours , where peoples souls live inside their bodies . And worlds like mine , where they walk beside us , as animal spirits we call , daemons . Are we going to see the child ? I should think so . So many worlds , but connecting them all , is Dust . Dust was here before the witches of the air , the Gyptians of the water , and the bears of the ice . In my world , scholars invented an Alethiometer . A golden compass . And it showed them all that was hidden . But the ruling power , fearing any truth but their own , destroyed these devices , And forbade the very mention of " Dust " . One compass remains however , and only one who can read it . Ahhh , you 'll never get me ! Lets go get him Lyra . I 'll get you ! - I 'll get you first ! Billy ! You come back here ! Run , Roger ! .. , will do what ever
zone2	" gobble " you . Hurry Up . Stop ! If you value your lives , come no further . Why ? We gobbled him fair and square . This ai n't no game , Billy Costa . Do n't you know what gate that is ? It 's the back door to your stupid college . So ? - There 's a curse on this gate . You Gypsians ought to know that . Crossing this gate , is worse than touching someone 's daemon with your bare hands . Why ai n't nothing happened to you , then ? ' Cause we live here . We got safe passage , see ? And anyway , my mother 's one who put the curse on this place in the first place . What mother ? I heard you was an orphan . And your uncle only left you here cause ' nobody wanted you . Come here and say that . Do n't Billy ! You should listen to your mate . The scholars got this special room where they deal with trespassers . They got this poison gown
zone2	Hand him over . It ai n't rubbish . I 'll prove it , I 'll steal it ! You can have Roger , as long as you try it on . Alright . Bring it with you tonight . Or else ... War ; Billy , do n't ! See you later then . - Ok . Were you really gon na hand me over to them ? Of course not . I 'll steal any old scholar 's gown . He 'll never try it on anyway . Lord Asriel ? - Morning , Hunt . Well the Master we be relieved that you 've arrived safely . Sure he will . I wish you 'd listen to me once in a while . - Stop being such a coward . If I were n't such a coward , where would you be ? In the retiring room already . Come on , quick ! Let 's find a robe and get out of here . Do n't be silly . I want to look around . You do know that if you get a smack , I
zone2	caught . Oh no ! I told you ! Lord Asriel is an eminent fellow of the colleagues . And as master of Jordan ... you must force him to abandon his plan . They 're talking about uncle Asriel . I speak for the Magisterium . The Magisterium has no authorities within these walls . My dear fellow , The Magisterium has authority everywhere . And Asriel will be silenced ... one way or another . That may be ... But while he 's at Jordan , his proposal will be heard . I 'm not dispensed with centuries of intolerance , free enquiry ... And that 's my final word on the matter . Now , if you 'll excuse me ... I shall call the council to order . I guess we lost that bet . - Hush , Pan . Lyra ! He 's leaving , let 's go . Lyra ! Oh no , Stelmaria . The Master asked me to decant a bottle of bourbon 1995 for you , Lord Asriel . He remember you were partial to it . Thank You . Lyra
zone2	ai n't nonsense . I saw that man from the Magisterium poured some powder into the wine . Go back in there , keep your eyes open and your mouth shut ... go on . Ahh , Lord Asriel this a rare pleasure ... May I introduce Fra Pavel of the Magisterium . We 've never met , but I follow your exploits ... closely , Lord Asriel . That 's what the smell is ... Master , Gentlemen , I shall gget straight to the point . Hunt , the lights . This photogram was taken at the magnetic north pole . in Svalbard , Kingdom of the Ice bears . Lord Asriel , is that light rising up from the man 's body or coming down . No , that 's coming down from the sky , but that 's not light . It 's Dust . What 's Dust ? - I do n't know , it ca n't be the normal sort , they got plenty of that here . Mirabile dictu , gentlemen , allow Lord Asriel to explain . Perhaps , you 've made
zone2	some kind . No it no aboration . The behaviour of these particles is quite unmistakable . Dust is flowing in to this man , through his daemon , from a city in another world . A world much like ours in a parallel universe . co-existing with our own , invisible , intangible , inaccessible , until now . From there , and from a billion other worlds Dust flows . Worlds of infinite possibilities , somewhere men have no daemons , somewhere daemons have no men ... People without daemons . That 's impossible . And even some who have no Magisterium . And no authority . That is heresy . That is the truth . I would n't recommend the Tokay , gentlemen , it 's caught . To discover the source of Dust , I intend to travel to these worlds . With the sufficient source of energy . And ... Well ... a sufficient source of funds . I can affect the crossing . I humbly beg the college council to fund such a journey . It was n't my fault , she would n't

Yes , I would . - Well , I do n't see why . Apparently you are impossible to educate , a miscreant , and a liar . What will the Magisterium do to you now ? The Magisterium 's day are numbered . What does that mean ? - Trouble , with a bit of luck . Did you get the money you needed ? Are you going North again ? The college counsel has defied The Magisterium . I 'm leaving immediately . Can I come with you ? I wan na see the Ice bears , and glaciers , and learn about Dust and everything . What do you know about dust ? Nothing . - Good . Keep it that way . Now be a good girl and do what you 're told . But you do n't do what you 're told ! You do n't
zone2	and look at the welcome I got ! Hush Pan . - I see your daemon still changes shape . Has n't settled yet ? - Yeah . That 's to do with Dust , does n't it . Why kids ' daemons can change shape but grown-up 's deamons ca n't . Lyra , Dust is none of your business . Now you try and behave . My uncle Asriel said he 'd take me to the north the next time he goes . He swore it . ' Cause he needs my help , see . - What for ? Fighting probably . Or spying . He uses me as a spy sometimes . Like now for instance . I 'm supposed to be keepin ' an eye on them Gobblers . ' Cause they took them Gypsian kids out Boundry Ray . Billy Costa told me . I heard them Gobblers take them down to hell . Of course they do n't ! . You 're afraid of them , ai n't you ? - No I ai n't . But the adults are . Because kids
zone2	, you see ? . The orphans ... and the servant kids as well . Roger , I promise , If you was taken by the Gobblers , I 'd come and rescue you . You 'd come get me too would n't you ? Of course . It 's everybody who would come looking for you , if you was gobbled . You 're a lady . - Says Who ? Cook . He says that 's why you are the only one who live here . To make you a lady . Nobody can make me a lady ! Not the master and the scholars and porces combined . Right ! Take it back , or we ai n't best mates no more . Alright , alright you ai n't a lady ! Lyra ! Lyra Belaqua get down off them roofs ! The Master wants you at High Table . The state of your knees , and your hair . Well ... It 's not surprising . Roger and me 's been hunting Gobblers . It 's dirty work . Do n't you make jokes about them
zone2	go missing . Lyra , my dear , the tutor of Metaphysics tells me that you 've missed your lesson again . Now , I know you do not always understand our need to educate you , but sometimes you must do , what others think best . But I disagree , Master . - Mrs . Coulter . When I was a young woman i knew that no one could ever truly understand me . Except of course my daemon . And that it would be best if we were to do as we pleased . Sit down , Gentlemen . Who 's she ? - Do n't know , but she shut up the Master , alright . Mrs . Coulter , this is our Lyra , Lyra Belaqua , Lord Asriel 's niece . Lyra , this is Mrs . Coulter , a friend of the college . Lovely to meet you . - Lovely to meet you , too . Do you know , I 've met Lord Asriel ? It was at the Royal Arctic Institute . We discussed the political structure of the Ice
zone2	? As the matter of fact , I have had an audience with the Bear king himself , Ragnar Stursson . And I 'll tell you something I probably should n't : . King Ragnar is desperate to have a daemon of his own . Bears do n't have them you see ... and Ragnar , he likes to think of himself as a person , And he will stop at nothing to get one . But you must n't repeat that . - Oh , I 'd never ! I feel I can trust you . I have to go back to the north very soon . I 'm going to need an assistant . Me ? Go to the North ? - North ? It 's cold up there . We 'd better get the Master 's permission . Master , I was wondering if I might borrow dear Lyra ? Only for a while , of course . I 'm not sure that would be consistant with Lord Asriels wishes for her education . I 'll deal with Asriel . You must n't deny me this little
zone2	A bet 's a bet . Lyra was supposed to show up with the gown . I told you they would n't let her out of the college . Which one 's her room ? What are you gon na do ? - Give her a fright , that 's all . We get caught , I 'll be skinned alive . Night 's patrol is bound to be doing his rounds . Ratter , check if the coast is clear . It 's all clear . Billy ! Billy ! The scholars still refuse to hand over the last alethiomether . And now they 've given Asriel all the funds he needs . If he succeeds in proving the existence of these other worlds it will contradict centuries of teaching . There will always be free thinkers , and heretics . Unless we deal with the root of the problem . That is why Mrs . Coulter 's work is so important . What progress has she made ? - The doctors at Bolvanger , are close to perfecting the inoculation against the effects of Dust . I am
zone2	children from the corrupting influence of Dust , before their daemon settle , we will nurture a generation at peace with itself . One that will never question our authority again . We owe it to the young . Do we not ? I fear , our defiance will not go unpunished and I shall be drawn into it - We 've failed her . - We 've protected her as long as we could , Master . She 's still a child . She ca n't possibly be a threat to them . She is . She is meant to play a major part in what is to come . How could you know such things ? The Witches . Could you , could you stay by the door ? Mrs . Longsdale , it is important that I know if I was followed . Yes , Master . It 's for you Lyra . - What is this ? An Alethiometer . Also known as a Golden Compass . It was given to the college by Lord Asriel , years ago . And now , I 'm giving
zone2	to have it . What 's it for ? - It tells the truth . We 've always tried to acquaint you with the truth but the secrets of the heart and things , elude scholars and authorities . But this lets you glimpse things as they are . But Lyra , keep the alethiometer to yourself . It is of the utmost importance , that Mrs . Coulter does not know that you have it , Do you understand me ? Of the utmost importance . Lyra ! Are you ready ? There 's someone missing . I want to say goodbye to Roger . - Roger ? Who 's Roger ? My friend . He works in the kitchens . We must go . The ferry 's about to take off . Why do n't you write him a letter ? You can tell him all about the journey and you can even send him a photograph . What do you think ? - Yeah , I suppose . Mrs . Coulter , what 's that ? That is the Magisterial seat , Lyra . Oh , what
zone2	00:23:21,932 The Magisterium is what people need to keep things working by telling people what to do . But you told the Master you did whatever you pleased . That 's Right , clever girl . Well ... some people know what 's good for them , and some people do n't . Besides , they do n't people what to do in a mean , petty way . They tell them what to do in a kindly way . To keep them out of danger . Sugar ? SVALBARD Look Pan , it 's got loads of pictures around the edge . What do they all mean ? - Do n't know . The needle keep stopping at the same symbols . Lady , lightning bolt and a baby . Then it goes back , and does it again , see ? What do you think makes the needle move ? I do n't know . Maybe Uncle Asriel knows . Maybe we 're supposed to take it to him . All washed , and ready for bed ? We have a busy few weeks . Well it was
zone2	offer more ice with their drinks , I shall never understand . I 'll only be a moment , darling . Official business . What ? - She likes to show off her new pet , does n't she ? She 's never taking us to the North . We 're like prisoners in this house . All these rules , and rooms that we are n't allowed in to . Perhaps we should n't have invited Professor Docker . He 's such a bore is n't he ? And he had sauce in his beard . But he is one of the foremost experts on particle Metaphysics . Have I told you what a particle is ? - Oh I know about particles . Like Dust . That 's a particle , is n't it . - Dust ? I mean the Dust from space . That Dust . Like in the north . Oh , where did you hear about that ? It must have been one of the scholars at Jordan . A wise person knows Lyra , there are some thing we best ignore . Subjects
zone2	... - Yes , You did n't know , so I forgive you . Just do n't mention it again . Now darling , will you take off that childish shoulder bag . I do n't like seeing you wearing it indoors . Please Mrs . Coulter . I do love it . - But I do not . Put it away . Lyra , put it away now . - I do n't want to . If you do not obey me , we will have an argument which I will win . Now put it away at once ! It 's absurd to be carrying around a shoulder bag in your own home . Jordan is my home . Lyra ! Do n't ! Please , it hurts ! - Lyra ! Do as I tell you . - I promise . Lyra . - Thank you . And while you 're at it , you must learn to control your daemon . He is much too wild . Now , kiss me . I hate her ! I hate them . And look , they 're spying
zone2	Why are we here ? Did you see her daemon ? He went to shock when you mentioned Dust . And what does she keep in that room ? Let 's go find out . Maybe this is n't such a good idea . Over here . That 's just one of her stupid guest lists . - No it is n't . Look at it . " Intercision " . What does it mean , Pan ? And that ? General Oblation Board . G.O.B . - Gobblers . From the letters . G.O.B . Workman , Edwards , Parslow , Costa . Billy and Roger ! Pan , it 's her . She is running the Gobblers ! - Lyra , where are you ? We have to get out of here . Lyra ! Lyra , what have you been doing ? - Nothing . Well we must find something for you to do . Shall you help me arrange our passage to the Noroway ? Oh you do want to come to the north with me , do n't you ? Where is he ? I
zone2	Quick , Lyra ! Lyra ! What are we gon na do , Pan ? We got to save Roger , and Billy . We 've got ta save ourselves first . Where are we gon na go ? Anywhere is better than here . Come on , this way ! Alright then , split up , the girl ca n't be far . Spread out . Search all the buildings . - Gobblers ! You , cover the canal . She 's got ta be here somewhere . Get her ! Pan ! - Run , Lyra ! Lyra ! Pan ! Lyra ! - Pan ! Gyptians . Do n't threaten on , Lyra . Come here . You 're save with us . - You 're Ma Costa , Billy 's Mum . But , what are you doing here ? - We 've been in your shadow ever since you left Jordan College , watching over you . An a good thing too . You best come with us . Where are we going ? - To see Lord Faa , King of the Gypsians ..
zone2	looking at ? So now all the clans are here and we 'll head north on the next tide Ma Costa ! This is the child . It 's alright . How do you do , Lord Faa ? Hello Lyra , you come and sit by my side . This is Farder Coram . And these are the chiefs of the gypsian families . You 're are our guest here and you are under our protection . Lord Faa , I want to thank you . For keeping watch with me and all ... But why did you do it ? Lord Asriel has been a good friend to the Gypsians this many a year and ... This many a year it has been our charge to bring him news of you , as we traveled along our ways . But you did n't know that , did you ? And when Mrs . Coulter got a hold of you , well ... we suspected that she had something to do with the Gobblers . And she did . She and them Gobblers took my little boy , Billy
zone2	ran away the Costas found you . But ss there anything else you can tell us ? Is there anything you may have forgot ? Do n't show it to them . The Master of Jordan gave me this . I thought they was all taken by the Magisterium . It 's an alethiometer . It 's a truth measurer . A Golden compass . It enables you to see , what others wish to hide . You 've got three hands that you can control . By pointing at three symbols , you can ask any sort of question you can imagine . Once you 've got your question framed , this blue needle points to more symbols , that give you the answer . - Could it be used to find the missing children ? Not by me . The art was jealously guarded . - Can I try ? Alright . - What are you doing , Lyra ? You do n't know how to read it . - Hush Pan ! Well , the serpent is cunning , like the Gobblers . And the Pot could
zone2	That means kids . One thing I do know , Lyra , you must n't grasp at the answer . Hold the question in your mind but lightly , like it was something alive . It 's an hourglass . But it came around to it on the second time . The first time it only stopped there a moment . On top of the hourglass , is a scull . Thank you children . Finish your letters now . Billy Costa , why did n't you write anything ? Your mother must be missing you terribly . I do n't know what to put in the letter , Miss . They have n't told us what we 're here for . You 're here to help us . And just as soon as you 've helped us , we 'll send you back home . That 's what you should write . Or do n't they teach gypsian children to write ? They teach us to write the truth , miss . Billy , just write the letter . Well , as I 'll be posting these straight away
zone2	I confess I am puzzled by your interest in the Belaqua-girl . For one thing , she is in possession of the alethiometer . How ... ah yes , the Master . Can she read it ? - Of course not . Mrs . Coulter , are you familiar with the prophecies of the witches ? You think she is that child ? Impossible . Nonetheless , she must be found . They 'll seek her out , like bees to honey . Svalbard . Kingdom of the Ice bears . We shall have to watch ourselves Stelmaria You can bet that Coulter-woman has hired every Samoyed-bandit from here to the pole to hunt us down . Do n't be so hasty . We can work this out like gentlemen . Do n't worry Lyra . We 'll find Roger . I 'm alright . What is it ? - It 's a spy fly . Is it dangerous ? The one that got away is . If you was to crack it open , you find no living thing in there . No animal or insect at any rate
zone2	of it is a bad spirit with and a sleeping poison in its sting . We 'll keep him safe , in here . What was it after ? - You , Lyra .. Why me ? Why are they doing this ? We do n't know . But we Gypsians are being hurt worse than most by these Gobblers . These child thieves , They 're taking our children up North . The land of cold and dark . What they are doing with them there , we do n't know . But we have heard terrible rumor . Our aim is first to go north and to rescue these children . Both gypsian and landlubber alike . But if they have been harmed ... I promise you , if they have been harmed there is not a place , nor on land , nor on sea for these Gobblers . And when the time comes to punish , we will strike such a blow , as will make their hearts faint and fearful . We will strike the strength out of them . We will leave them broken
zone2	- Scared ? A little . It 's all bigger and scarier than we ever thought . Maybe we should n't be doing this . - But we 've got to , ai n't we ? Go on I mean . Who are you ? My name is Serafina Pekkala . Clan queen of the witches of Lake Enara . A witch . Where 's your daemon ? - Kaisa can fly a long way from me . Are you the girl the Magisterium seeks ? The one with the symbol reader ? Let me see you read it . I want to know if you can tell me .. which of the men on this ship was once my lover . Farder Coram ... but ... He was young and beautiful once and we witches live for hundreds of years . Farder Coram wishes to know where the child-cutters take their prey . It is a place they call Bolvangar . The place of fear . A regiment of Tartars with wolf-daemons guards it . Birds do not fly above . Animals have fled . Even the Samoyeds fear
zone2	the coast of Noroway . You will find something to help you in Trollesund . You will need all your courage . I 'm glad I 've lived long enough to see you , child . Who 's going to help us ? Can you see anything ? Lyra , you 're not listening to me ! That 's a mighty fancy clockwork you got there . It 's just a toy . - Uhuh . Hell then it 's a mighty fancy toy . How did you come by something like that ? Oh Lord , Lee when are you gon na learn to mind your own business ? I do beg pardon . Lee Scoresby , and this old gal is Hester . I 'm Lyra . This is Pan . Pantalaimon . Howdy ? Mighty pleased , Miss Lyra . You rode in with them Gypsian fellows , am I right ? Oh , boy . Here I go again . Do n't answer that . What are you doing in Trollesund , Mr . Scoresby ? Oh , a friend of mine got himself into a
zone2	do about it . - Me too . Of course , that ai n't my normal occupation . Most of the time I plan my trade up in the sky . You 're an aeronaut ! Can I go up in your ship ? - I 'd be honored . Just as soon as I get her out of hawk . Miss Lyra , I 'd like to give you a word of advice , though you ai n't asked for none . If I was on the kinda scout , that I reckon you 're on , I 'd hire myself an aeronaut , and an armored bear . An armored bear ? - There 's one in town . Iorek Byrnison 's his name . Works at the sled depot behind Arson 's Bar . Good one to to have on your side in a scrap . Not that you 're looking for that . Iorek Byrnison , Iorek Byrnison , may I speak to you ? What ? - We want to offer you employment . I am employed by the town 's people . I mend
zone2	of work is that for a panserbjorne ? Paid work ! Is that what they pay you ? Whisky ? Iorek Byrnison , you are the first Ice bear I have ever met . I was ever so excited and scared . But now I 'm just disappointed . I heard that bears lived to hunt and to fight . Why are you wasting your time here , drinking whisky ? I stay because the people of this town gave me spirits and let me drink till I was asleep , and they took my armor away . And without my armour , I can not go to war . And I am an armoured bear . War is the sea I swim in , the I breath , without my armour I am nothing ! But ... Ca n't you make new armor ? I thought bears were good at that . There 's all this metal around . - Worthless ! My Armour is made of sky iron , from the falling stars that land in Svalbard . A bear 's Armour is his soul , as your
zone2	well take him away and replace him with a doll . It must have been terrible to lose your armor . I was no less than I deserved . I am in exile . I was sent away from Svalbard because I was unworthy . I fought another bear in single combat and was defeated . Come child . We ca n't involve ourselves . He was prince . He would have been the king if the other bear had n't defeated him . He lost everything . Oh Pan , they 've really hurt him . Iorek Byrnison . Iorek Byrnison . Be careful . - I know where your armour is . They tricked you out of it . They should n't have done that , Iorek Byrnison . It 's in the District Office of the Magisterium , right here , in Trollesund . What 's your name child ? - Lyra Belaqua . Then , Lyra Belaqua , I owe you a debt . I will serve you in your campaign , until I am dead or you have a victory . Iorek ! Iorek Byrnison
zone2	What they 've done ai n't right , I know . If you fight you 'll kill them , there 'll be more fighting and we 'll never get away to rescue those kids . Just not be too hasty . Way I see it , there 's no need for a dust-up . Howdy Iorek . I was down south heard you ran in to a little local trouble . Did n't have the first notion on how to spring ya . Fortunately little girls come in real resourceful up in these parts . Well look at here , reinforcements . What do you say you fellow just call it a day . Just been hired on by these gentlemen of the Gypsian persuasion . You figuring on joining this turkey shoot ? Yes . I have a contract with the child . That 's some pretty fast work Miss Lyra . My Lord ... Rise , Fra Pavel ! I have received your news about the Gypsian party heading to the North . The matter is of the first importance . They must be eliminated , and Bolvangar
zone2	. Which is why it must be taken out of the hands of the Coulter woman . Oh . - It was Mrs . Coulter who and then let her slip away . Yes , that is the most troubling of all . No matter . One way or another , it is better that I 've sent Mrs . Coulter after the child . You 've sent her ? - Yes . She is to demonstrate the improvements to the intercision-process upon the Belaqua-girl . I 'm sorry . I would never hurt you . Oh , Lyra . I 'll find you . I will find you . Careful now boys , airship machinery is kind of finicky . I wan na die in a rocket chair not a hydrogen fire . ... but she was ever so clever , Mrs . Coulter . But she was always telling me what to do . I do n't like people telling me what to do . I bet you do n't like it either . I can tell . You 're like my Uncle Asriel . He 's a

What can you see ? Where are we going ? - Hush Pan Iorek ? - What is it child ? The alethiometer keeps telling me something . In the next valley there 's a lake with a house by , And it is troubled by a ghost . It 's something to do with the Gobblers and Roger . You could take me there , could n't you . You could carry me there and back before anyone knew , could n't you ? You wish to ride me ? - Yeah . We will travel faster without armor . Are those birds ? - Witches . More than I have ever seen . - Where are they going ? Flying to war . If they are flying to the aid of your enemies you should all be afraid . Are you afraid ? - No . When I
zone2	make sure the way is clear . No , stay here . Lyra no . Please do n't ! Something 's wrong . - Hush , Pan . Something terrible . I 'm eh ... I 'm afraid . We 've got to master our fear . Hello ? Hello ? Billy . - Where is his daemon ? He does n't have a daemon . That 's ... intercision . That 's what the Gobblers do . Cutting away kids ' daemons . Where 's my Ratter ? Have you seen her ? Billy , it 's me , Lyra . Let me take you back to your mum . I need Ratter . - Billy come on with me . We 'll take you some place safe . We 'll find Ratter . Gracious God what 's this ? Lyra child , what have you found ? Billy . Billy Costa . Oh Billy , You 're alright Billy . You 're safe now . We 'll find your deamon , we 'll bring her back . Here , take Lyra ! Defence ! To arms ! Protect

The Samoyedes wo n't lay a hand on her , she 's worth more in one piece . I 'll find her . I 'll bring her back . I can bargain with Ragnar . ... drop you to border , pick you up on the way out . No . I will not leave her . If you show up in Svalbard , Ragnar and the rest of them will tear you to pieces , you know that . I know that I would feel ashamed to show less courage than that child . That kind of courage can get you killed . I will not live in shame any longer , Scoresby . I reckon not . Let me take her down . Pick up the trail . Do n't worry , Iorek will come . That 's just it Pan . There
zone2	We 've got to do something . Do you remember what Mrs . Coulter said back at Jordan ? About the King of the bears wanting a Daemon . Pan , I need you to hide . Do n't let them see you . That 's fine with me . We can beat him , Pan . What is this little thing ? - All greetings to you , Great King . Or rather , my greetings and not his . Not whose ? - Iorek Byrnison 's , Your Majesty . What have you to do with Iorek Byrnison ? I 'm Iorek Byrnison 's daemon . How has he , exile , the unworthy Iorek Byrnison obtained a daemon ! ? Iorek Byrnison was the first bear to receive a daemon , but it should have been you . They gave me to him at Bolvangar . Mrs . Coulter did . How can you be so far from him . I 'm like a witch 's daemon , Great King . I can go as far from him as I please . Well ... If you are
zone2	and be free of an enemy ! If you do that , I can never be your daemon . My daemon ? That 's why I come here , see . Cause I want to be your daemon , not his . He 's just an exile , nothing . But you - you 're powerful , and clever , and rich , and ... and better in every way . He 's on his way here now to fight you . What ? He 's mad . We shall destroy him ! No . No . If you defeat him I will become your daemon . But you must defeat him in single combat . Then all his strength will flow into yours . And my mind will flow into your mind . You and me together . Have him killed any other way , I 'll just go out like a light and you 'll never have deamon . Prove it . Prove to me that you are a daemon . Ask me something only you know . How did I become king ? What is that ?
zone2	We daemons use it to see the truth in our own eyes . Truly you are great and powerful , Ragnar . You poisoned the old king , then challenged the heir to the throne , and beat him in single combat . Iorek Byrnison . Oh Pan , what have I done ? Ragnar is too strong . Here he is ... What if the coward dare not fight me . Great king , let me speak to him . If I do he will not suspect . - Very well . You go to him . Give him courage . Bring him to his death . Soon you 'll be mine . Oh Iorek , Iorek dear , I 've done a terrible thing . What terrible thing ? Told the king I was your daemon , and that he must fight you . If not , they would never let you fight . The would burn you before you got up close . But you 've been fighting and running all this way . Lyra , Lyra Belaqua ... No , I shall call you , Lyra
zone2	I want . Come , little daemon . Fight well , Iorek my dear . You 're the real king , and he ai n't nothing . Lyra , if I am killed , Scoresby will find you . Is that all , whimpering cob ? Is that all ? Soon to die ? Is that all ? Ha ? Is that all ! ? Yes , that is all , that is all ! Bears ! Who 's your king ! ? Iorek , Iorek I thought I 'd lost you . - Why ? You 're still own my contract . And now I will take you to Bolvangar . We 've got to stop them Iorek , the alethiometer says they 'll hurt Roger . There . It may not hold us both . You cross on your own , I will follow . I 'm right here , step quickly , do n't look down . Do n't look back , you 're almost there ! Run Lyra , run ! Run ! Lyra , I will get Scoresby and the Gypsians . Wait for me
zone2	the look of this place . Bolvanger ! - Hello there . I ... I got lost in the snow . Where am I ? No need to worry my child . You 're safe now . You better come inside . It 's warm and comfortable in here . What 's your name . - Do n't tell him who we are . Lizzie . Lizzie Brooks . What were you doing so far north Lizzie , that must be an interesting story . My dad and uncles , they took me north . they 're traders . Well , you 're very lucky to have found us when you got lost . What is this place ? - Oh , you 'll like it . It 's called the experimental station . - What do you do here ? We help children grow up . - Liar . You must be hungry Lizzie . Lucky you , just in time for dinner . Can you see him ? Is he here ? Lyra , it 's them ! - Pan , you found us ! You kept your
zone2	promised , did n't I ? Roger , do you know what they do to the kids here ? Well they say they 're gon na give us this operation , right ? Then they 'll send us home , and we wo n't have to worry about Dust . But once they call a kid in , you 'll never see them again . They took Billy Costa away last week , and he 's still gone . Do n't worry . I 've got a plan , alright ? Tell the kids to have their warm clothes ready . I need to be alone somewhere . But not here . They hardly ever use this one . But be quick . Ask it how we are gon na get out of here . But why would it ... - Oh no , it 's them . ... that may be so , but I 'm interested in discovering how several children managed to wander free from the station . Mrs . Coulter , I hope you understand , that the question is moot . Any child who escapes
zone2	cold . We have already recovered 2 out of the 3 missing children . Where they alive ? Well that is unfortunate ... But enough of that for now . I , at least , have some good news . We need n't be concerned with Lord Asriel any longer . He has bribed his captors and set up a secret laboratory in the further reaches of the North . The Magistiriums soldiers are on their way . He will be arrested for heresy , and sentenced to death . Put him to death ? Dear me . I think I will retire for the evening . Oh well , yes , of course the orders will show you to your chambers . I would n't get on the wrong side of her I 'll tell you that . She 's positively girlish . You remember the first experiments ? When she was so keen to see them pulled apart . Her and the hood of a daemon . What was that ? - Down there , under the table . You ca n't ! You 're not allowed .
zone2	. Straight into the chamber . Let me go ! Iorek Byrnison 's gon na kill you . Do n't be afraid , my dear . It 's only a little cut . - You 'll never keep us apart ! You wan na grow up , do n't you . Well , this is how you grow up . Stay away from me ! You 'll never keep us apart ! Never ! Never ! No stop ! Lyra ! - Pan ! Lyra ! Do n't ! Do n't you touch ! No one is going to hurt you . No one is ever , ever going to hurt you . They did it to Billy , and to those other kids . They cut their deamons away . Why ? Why are they doing that ? I know it 's difficult to understand , but it 's for their own good . It 's just a little cut . You listen , listen to me . A long long time ago , some of our ancestors made , made a terrible mistake . They disobeyed the Authority
zone2	the world . And ever since then , we 've been sick with it . We 've been sick with Dust . But there is a way out . You see , Dust does n't settle on innocent children . It 's later . When your daemon begins to settle . The Dust begins to swarm all around us , trying to work its mischief . And that is how children begin to have all sorts of nasty thoughts and unhappy feelings . But there is a way to stop it . A little cut . and gone forever . Well if it 's so good , then why do n't you do it yourself . Why did n't you let them do it to me ? I 'm going to tell you something . Something very important , something you do n't know . Intercision is n't perfect yet , and you 're not just anyone , Lyra . Your mother did n't die in an airship accident as you were told . She was n't married to your father and even though and even though she loved you
zone2	It was n't allowed . So you were taken from her , and it was n't until things changed and she was free to do as she wanted , that that she went to Jordan College and spoke to the Master . No ! You ca n't be ! Yes , Lyra . You 're mine . And you 're safe with me . You 'll always be safe with me . Who 's my father ? Lord Asriel ? He 's my father , is n't he ? Yes . Yes . Now I almost forgot . The Master of Jordan gave you something , did n't he ? He gave you an alethiometer , did n't he ? But you see , it was n't really his to give , well he did must have seemed like a puzzle , what a silly old thing like that was any good for . Alright . Here it is . Thank you . What a funny old tin . Did you put it in here to keep it safe ? Run ! Lyra , let 's go ! Go !
zone2	! Run child ! Let 's go ! Better not touch me . I 'm warning you . Serafina Pekkala . Mrs . Coulter ! Get her out ! Go ! Well come on ! Charge ! Mr . Scoresby , help Iorek ! Come on ! Gyptians to me ! We 're going home ! Lyra , we 've got to go ! It 's time to go home . I ca n't Roger . I 've got to go to my father and bring him the alethiometer . Your father ? - Lord Asriel . Mrs . Coulter and them , they 're gon na kill him . Then I 'm going too . You said you was gon na come get me . You got me . Miss Lyra ! Are you ready to fly ? I know where she 's going . Well , they 're all tugged in back there . That little girl 's something , huh ? There 's a prophecy about that child , Mr . Scoresby . She will decide the war which is to come . - War ? I
zone2	You will . It is your war too , whether you know it or not . What would the quarrel be about ? - Nothing less than free will . The Magisterium not only seeks to control everyone in this world , but every world , in every universe . They 've been unable to extend their power until now , but if Asriel finds a way to travel between worlds , nothing will stop them from trying to take over . Nothing but us , and that child . What 's it telling you ? It 's telling me about my father . It says I 'm bringing him what he needs ! We 're going home , are n't we Lyra ? After we save your father ? Of course . Except first we got to sort out some things that needs sorted . Like Billy and another kids who lost their daemons . We 've got to help them . And it is n't like The Magisterium 's just gon na let us go home to Jordan just like that . And Dust . I want to
zone2	go to that other world with my father , and find out . That 's an awful lot to sort out . - Well who else is gon na do it ? Besides , we 're in this together now . - Yeah . Suppose we are . You reckon it would do any harm to get some sleep now ? Go on then . We 'll set things right . We will . You , and me , and Iorek and Serafina Pekkala and Mr . Scoresby . And my father . We 'll set it right , Pan . Just let them try to stop us .

It 's Caesar , from the house of Julia . Arrest him . No please no ! Are you Julius Caesar ? - Yes . This way ... This way . That is not negotiable . Who is he ? Julius Caesar . Nephew to Marius ... You have unfortunate ancestry . If you
zone2	. Which God is that ? - The Julia descendent from Aeneas , Who was ... - The son of Venus , yes yes . I recall Marius making such claims . There are many people these days who claim to be descendents from the Gods . We have a crest which proves it .. I believe you can have them fashioned in the market place for a couple of dinars . Why did you ask to see me ? Your mother ... She came to see me . Did she ask you to spare my life ? And what you agreed ? Well I promised that I would consider it . And I 'm supposed to be grateful to you ? - No . To you we are old friends . - You killed a lot of old friends ... True , true true . Old friends of the day become fresh enemies at night . What do you want in exchange for my life ? Why do you think I want anything in Exchange ? And like you do n't give things away for free . I 'm

He escaped my soldiers only to be killed by one of his servants . My wife ? - She 's well . I leave women to their health . And since you are only the son of Cinna by marriage , I intend to leave you to yours . If ... ? If you divorce your wife . Well ? No I refuse . - You refuse to divorce your wife Even though it may cost you your life ? My wife is my teacher . She 's more clever than I am , She 's more honest than I am , She 's a more compelling argument than I am or you are . Or your office is . I wo n't divorce her . That is my answer . - Ah , Pompey ... What can we do with men such as this ? I do n't know weather to embrace him or strangle
zone2	- What ? His uncle Marius was my greatest enemy . He 's got ten Marius inside him . Look at his eyes . You want to let him go ? It 's the one's who smile and flatter you should worry about . He speaks plainly . You speak plainly do n't you ? Always . Tell me ... Would you kill me if you could ? In an instant . You can go . I said you are free to go . What a big heart that boy has . Bring it to me in the morning . Was this Sulla 's plan to slaughter me outside so I would n't foul the carpet with my blood ? I came to warn you . - Why ? Because if you do n't leave Rome I 'll have to do as he asks . And ? And I do n't want to see men like you die young .. What do you know about me ? - You refuse Sulla . I 'll tell you more some day when there is time . But now you must leave Rome
zone2	. Go east to Bythinia . Show this ring to Nicomedias , it will keep you safe in his service . How do I know I can trust you ? - You do n't . I 'll not hand my fate over to that man . So you 'd let him kill you ? He can try if he wants , I 'm not leaving Rome . Why must you be so stubborn ! Pompey himself offers you help . Why do n't you accept it ? He 's Sulla 's man , it could be a trick . Do n't you trust anybody at all ? - yes . I trust you . - Then listen to me . You 're not the heaven and the earth . You 're just a man . And some things are bigger than you are . When you were in jail I thought you were dead . I started to grieve your death . I 'm asking you to spare me that , Caesar . How can I live with myself if I knew I had one chance to save your life
zone2	- How much will you give me for it ? Ten dinars . - That 's good money for a swine . He requires carving . Julius Caesar . We will feed it to my dogs . That 's the coast of Crete . The ruler there used to make up laws and hang them so high that people could n't read them . And if they broke the law he 'd show then no mercy . Today the shores are infected by pirates . We need to anchor for the night . Where has father gone ? The other side of the water . How long does it take to cross the water ? It depends on the wind . Sometimes you can cross it in days . Sometimes if the air is still you may not move at all . Easy on the ropes , we could use nails . Its the Roman way is n't it ? What kind of ransom do you get for a Roman these days ? Two talents . But I 'll pay three to watch a roman drowned . You 'd get
zone2	? They would . If your men do n't return before dawn , you die . Your time is up , Roman . I 'll fight one of you for another day . That 's another day . Nobody is coming back for this Roman . Throw him in the sea . Ship ! Fifty talents . And the money just happened to find it 's way into your purse ? Sir I never stole a coin from you . And I suppose it was the goldsmiths who just happened to rob me again . Sir they 've been convicted for it . I know how these things work . You share the profits with these men . You pay me well I would never risk my life for a gold coin . This is the magistrate 's testament the goldsmiths have confessed . Flavius had nothing to do with it . Are you trying to tell me that a man who handles so much gold . never put a piece into his pocket ? He 's been proven innocent . This needs your signature . Strangle him . -
zone2	, just disapprove of the verdict . Sulla ... He 's a good man , and he 's here on my introduction . Allow me to vouch for him and protect him . You can vouch for him all you like . But protect him you can't . the penalty protests strangulation . Strangle him . - There seems to be an error of judgment . My judgment ? Pompey ... You 're becoming very critical . You want to rise above me . Just waiting for your chance . Those men worship the rising sun and not the setting sun . That 's how the saying goes is n't it ? But I am not the setting sun not yet but in the meantime I expect you to subordinate yourself to my wishes weather you understand them or not . Strangle him ! No ... You ... You strangle him . No . Taije did you hear him say no ? Ah , my dear general . I asked you to strangle Flavius and strangle Flavius you will . And you will do it with your own bare hands
zone2	strangled . Strangle him ! Strangle him now ! I will not have my orders disobeyed ! I swear to ... Father ... Who are your friends ? Portia and Marcus . Do n't you remember them ? Of course Cato 's children . Just do n't grow them so much . That 's our cousin . Brutus ... What you reading ? - " Ethics " . Aristotle ? - My uncle Cato gave it to me . How is he ? - He 's as grumpy as ever . Has n't changed a bit . - Mother . Caesar ! Do n't get up . - I 'm not ill . Let me get dressed . I 'm well , I just got up too fast . You do n't have to get dressed . Lets lie down together . No wait . Just ... Cornelia ... I never stopped waiting for you . I never stopped missing you . and now ... Here ... This is not supposed to happen . I 'm back now , my love . Two years is just too long . There
zone2	those of you who worked against him . But not all that worked with him agreed with his laws . I therefore propose that the rights of the tribunes be restored So that once again the people can be fairly represented . I propose a thorough reform of the courts . And an unqualified reinstatement of the senate As the principal body of government . Caesar ! It 's good to see you fresh from another victory . Oh he let 's me win . It makes me feel old . I 'm Glad to see you made it back safely . I hear you met with a number of obstacles . Yes . Fortunately your friend Nicomedias has proven to be a great ally . I never had a chance to thank you for saving my life . You defied Sulla . He told you to divorce your wife and you said no even though it meant sudden death . That impressed me . And it ... reminded me of something . You see my friend , Sulla once told me to divorce my wife . And unlike you
zone2	loved . Life is full of lessons . So we thought each other a thing of two . Tell me how to get where you are now . Do n't tell me I was wrong to hope you were spared . I have something to give to Rome . But I have no voice . If you want a voice in Rome , Win the people , speak from your heart ... And when you make a promise , keep it ! Pompey ... I promise you if you ever need my help just give me a sign , I 'll come to your aid . My name is Julius Caesar . I 'm here to honor my wife , Cornelia publicly and for the last time . She was a good woman . She gave no thought to her own wellbeing . Only to the wellbeing of others . Rome was her first and greatest love . We shared that love . We dreamt of a Rome without dictators . Where sons never raise their hands against their fathers . Where brothers never raise their swords against brothers .
zone2	side . I ask you now to join with me , In honoring not only the memory of my good wife , But in memory of all the good men and women who have died fighting for a better Rome . People of Rome , I , Julius Caesar , make you this promise on the body of my beloved wife I will not rest until the Rome she dreamed of is the Rome we live in . Join me . By not only the nephew to our beloved Marius , Who fought against the evils of Sulla who took his life from him . But I 'm also a son of the Julia , Who are descendents of the goddess Venus herself . I offer you my hand . A power supreme amongst mortal men , Granted by the gods superior to kings . Let us work together comrades , in our quest for an empire , that is boundless , united ... and free . We shall have to watch him . Or use him . Good morning to you , Caesar ... Hail Caesar . Greetings ,
zone2	Now then ... Ah here it is . And I hope it will make you smile . That 's the first I seen you smile in weeks . Stop it all of you ! There is nothing he can do about it . What happened ? - The price of bread has tripled . There is no grain in Rome . - Why ? Because the grain supply from Egypt was cut off by pirates . Half of Rome is without bread . The city is close to panic . Only the very rich can afford bread . We must fight the pirates now or Rome will be crippled forever . So I propose that Pompey be given legions to attack this problem once and for all . It 's not a question of weather or not we fight pirates , It 's a matter of how . I propose we equip ten small armies to fight the pirates at different parts of the coast . So the pirates can destroy Rome one two by the time ? The pirates are a bunch of uneducated hoodlums . I hardly think
zone2	. Lets talk about things are gentlemen . Not the way we would like then to be . I can attest to the threat posed by these scavengers . I was a victim of one of their assaults myself . Then perhaps you will regale us with your sea stories Gaius Julius In the tavern after the work of the senate is done . The work of the senate is rarely done . You see there are not thousands of pirates in our waters . But hundreds of thousands . Enough for all the rogue bands preying on single vessels . There are pirate admirals seeking , With thousands of ships and troops more skilled in naval combat even than our own . Pretty speeches like this wo n't even cook our lunch . No speeches do as little work as the senate . How dare this arrogant newcomer insult this Auguste body ? Auguste and plump , Bibulus , like your own body . Apparent from ardent chatter and inactivity . Enough , ... enough , ... enough ! We have a man in our company who can resolve
zone2	him with that duty ? No . I 'm with Caesar , we have no bread . Now are we a great empire or are we going to be ruled by outlaws ? To perform this commission , Pompey will have to be given an army twice the size of the one Sulla used to take Rome Have we learned nothing from the past ? I see Rome should go Hungary because Cato ca n't find a single man he can trust . Not any man with an army would take the state . Not every man is a Sulla . some men are ruled by circumstances but men of character bend circumstances to their will . They make nature behave in such a way that their will is carried out on this earth . They defy the elements . And sometimes defy their own base of nature . In order to see their ideals come alive before their eyes . Pompey is such a man . Those of you who have lived know one thing to keep the nation small . Civil strife . Tribes fighting tribes rather than
zone2	as we fight in this room seeking personal victories , enacting petty revenges , Rome will stay small ! I propose we put our opinions aside and let one feeling rule us for a time The love of Rome . I propose we put our strengths together and become a force The world has never seen . I propose you let a man a single man , lead us out of the dark . I propose Pompey . All those in favor . Marcus ... - Julia . Julia ... look at you . Brutus , wake up and tell Julia how beautiful she looks . Beautiful . - You like it ? All dressed for Pompey 's triumph ... Who 's going with me ? None of you wants to join the counsel of Rome ? No offense , father , but do you really think we 're going to trail around with your lecters around . Rome 's greatest general has returned . And we want to be free to run and follow him ... Run yes , ... run ... run Go and enjoy yourselves . Come
zone2	n't you going with them ? I want to return this to Apollonius . - What is this ? ' Ah yes the Plato 's law ... Did you read it ? - Yes . And ? Plato thinks that democracy is doomed to failure . He thinks that a state should be run by a dictator . A dictator who 's become enlightened through experience and learning . I do n't think Plato would get along with your uncle Cato . Brutus ! Hurry up ! - Come on ! Hurry and catch up with your friends or you 'll have to come along with me . See you at the ceremony . Goodbye , father . See , See ... Do you know what I want ? Thank you for your kindness . Let me take care of my son now .. Mother ... - Shh ... rest . Something happened to me there . It 's an affliction no more no less . Your grandfather suffered the same spells and lived into old age . Name something else . For happened those watching Pompey . He 's
zone2	like brothers . Yet we could n't be more different . He 's a great army leader . His province has made him the richest and most powerful man in Rome . Your father wanted you to be a statesman and now you are a counsel of Rome . That would have been beyond his dreams . I need an army . To turn yourself into a Pompey ? How would you pay and feed such an army ? Your counsel ship already costs a fortune . Yes , I am counsel and I am broke . Your attack today was stronger than usual . There was something else mother , this attack was different in other ways . How ? I saw something . I saw something at that moment . Not just about myself . But about the whole humankind . How we keep ourselves small . Then I realized I had not been inspired . And as I watched Pompey I saw that he was not inspired . And he would never be inspired . And I realized the difference between Pompey and me . Pompey has
zone2	. I need legions . Pompey has them . He will lend them to me . Why would Pompey do that diminishing his own power . What could you offer him in return to equal the value of an army ? We trust in the wisdom of our fathers And in their laws . and I , Cato , trust in him . Hail Pompey ! Cato , you flatter me . But let us give credit to another man . For I could not have fought a war across the sea Without knowledge that Rome was in safe hands here at home . For that we owe a debt of gratitude to my friend and fellow council , Gaius Julius Caesar ! Hail Caesar ! This is my daughter , Julia . - Yes I know we 've met . It would honor my house if you would give us a recitation . Not in front of so many people ? - You 've done it in larger groups than this . Father I assure you that I 'm not prepared for it . Come ... The daughter of
zone2	me and prays with me A man dear to me and dear to the gods . Mightier in victory than the kings of Myc ? nea With their golden haired horses . And stronger more than the battle ghosts That ride the shores of Troy . Hear me , Sons of gold headed men . Hear me sing the victory Of a man dear to me and to the Gods . Its really nothing . - No , Its not your fault . I 'm not sure who 's fault it is but I assure you I will find out and he will be punished severely . Thank you , councilor . What is your name ? - Calpurnia . From which house ? - Lucius Piso . I 'm sorry for staring , I thought perhaps we met somewhere before . Would you like to eat together ? - I 'd be delighted . What hour do you call this ? I think it 's known as the fifth hour . - Yes , The sun is coming up . You 're right , I was out with him
zone2	cares for me . - Ah yes , he 's twice your age . And your friend remember . Yes , he is my friend . I just want to know if he treats you with respect . I like him ... I do . I do n't love him not yet but , ... that may come Why are you behaving in such a manner ? He is council . He 's the first man in Rome . He has legions . The price is high . What price ? It 's customary for the father to offer a dowry . You know I have nothing to give you . I accept . I want a commission . Gaul . - Gaul ? It 's taken . By Cassius . - I need a victory in battle . Your not experienced enough in warfare and you need legions . Your legions ... She 's all I got , ... I want 50 thousand for her . 50,000 talents ? Soldiers . How could you do it ? How could you take my commission away ? Because I think Caesar
zone2	put my staff to considerable expense preparing my men . And you 'll be re-embursed . - What ? And I 'll propose that you will look after the garrison . The garrison ? - This wo n't do , Pompey . We should put this before the senate ... - Let 's not talk business At my wedding . It may tempt bad luck . I have a confession to make . What 's that ? We did meet before . or rather I met you but you did n't meet me . It was at the Pompey 's triumph . You fell . Nobody saw it but me . I held you to make sure you would n't hurt yourself . - Thank you . It shames me . I never know when its going to happen . Many believe those who have the condition are holy Blessed by the Gods . Perhaps . What do you suppose a child of both our faces blended together would look like ? I think that it would look rather beautiful . Do you ? Is it something you 'd like
zone2	? I am less sure about my own name than I am about this . I am terrible to have to ask . - We have servants . And if I want to go to bed early ? I 'll follow you . Caesar ... You must make me a promise . - Anything you like . Come back from this war alive . I promise you . And hurry . - That 's two promises . And win it . - That 's three promises . Now it is your turn to promise me one thing . Will you marry me before I leave . How many dead ? - In the region of 23,000 Celts . And Romans ? - 112 . I 'll have to prepare the burial back in Rome . We 're not returning to Rome . We 're going farther north . There 's a lot more of Rome out there . Just has n't called Rome yet . The Romans ! We must tell Caesar to retreat . What I gave to Caesar , I will not revoke . Wait ! Put down
zone2	land is ours , you have no right to be here . What is your name ? Vercing ? torix . You stayed to fight alone ? - This is my house . I built it with my own hands . And you 'll burn it down . You 're free to go . Give me a horse . You heard him . Give him a horse . My dear Caesar , The people speak of you with admiration . Some call you the great as they called Pompey . In the market people sometimes bow to me as they pass . You will also be delighted to know The marriage that began as an advantage , has blossomed into romance . Watching Julia and Pompey together delights me and saddens me . That you 're not here . No one could be prouder to be your wife , Caesar . But after so long without you , I fear I 'm getting used to my solitude . Come home soon my darling . Until then I will be waiting . Caesar has killed 300,000 Celts . He attacked peaceful
zone2	. Its beyond toleration ! This is how you thank a great Roman general ? Caesar sent 100,000 slaves back to Rome . Are you saying you have n't taken any of them ? Then if any come from him I would have got them from somewhere else . Pompey , you have to be worry . He 's been away three years fighting with your legions . He 's doubled their salary . They are totally devoted to him . My lords , As Cicero has put it so well : Strain every nerve for the preservation of the state . Look in every corner for the storms . They will burst upon you if you do not see them in time . I just remembered who he is ! What are you talking about ? - That man . Mark Antony ? Running from his debtors in Rome to find wealth in the provinces . Like all of us . - not me ! I still fight for the glory of Rome . My cavalry has been attacked . - By who ? Gaul tribesmen . 14,000 dead
zone2	acted under one leader . His name is Vercing ? torix . Where could we find him ? - In Alesia . How long is the march ? - Eight days . Vercing ? torix is in there With 18,000 of his men . Its the most invincible stronghold in Gaul . We 'll never break it . - We wo n't have to break it . We 'll build a wall around their city . We 'll trap them inside and starve them . Nobody has ever built a fortification of that length . Then we will be the first . Let 's not waste time . What do you want ? I 'm here to see Pompey . - Come here . Cato ... - Pompey . Julia ... What brings you to Pisa ? I 've come to speak with you . Your absence in Rome has been .. criticized . As you can see , my wife needs me here . Can we speak privately ? What 's the matter , Cato ? Did your conversation depend on speaking ill of my father ? Sit ,
zone2	to take the last stronghold in Gaul . Vercing ? torix has called for every tribe from the mountains to the sea . They are on the move toward Alesia . How many men ? Two hundred and fifty thousand . And my husband ? - Forty thousand . He 'll survive . He has survived these many years . He 's never been up against so much . Is this true ? Will my husband lose this time ? No one knows the outcome of war . You are consul , Pompey . Do something . If Caesar wins this battle ... - He will become the next Sulla . That 's what you were going to say was n't it ? That if he wins he will become the next Sulla ... Why are you worried , Cato ? You said he did n't stand a chance against the Gaul 's . Why call him back ? Why not leave him there to fight this battle to his own death ? If you leave him there your next Sulla will extinguish himself . You 're waiting for my
zone2	are you . To arms ! This is it . Soldiers at the gate ! He 's trying to fool us into gathering our troops here . How do you know what he 'll do ? Because that 's what I would do I will wait here for Vercing ? torix to make his move . His men are to weak to attack our main camp . He will move his cavalry here and try to break through the main wall While his allies attack from the outside . We can not let these two forces join together . If they do , We will not survive . Retreat ! Caesar your men are asking for you . It is with great sadness that I write this letter to you my dear husband . Your Julia gave birth early and she suffered some pain in doing so . The doctors were there and did what they could to ease her suffering . The child was a boy but frail their efforts could not save him . He looked like you Caesar , there was nobility in his face . Your
zone2	the end she could not . Pompey has kept himself from the senate , preferring instead to pass time in no company . He walks around the graveyard again and again , Keeping fresh garlands on her tomb . We take Alesia in the morning Open the gate . I know your only enemy is one man and he is standing before you now .. I 'm giving myself to you , Caesar . Our women died for us . I give you my own life so that you may let my men live . If my men die there will be nothing left of the Gauls , and no one left to worship our gods . I beg you . Enslave my people if you need to . But let them live . Your men will live . My dear wife , You 'll have to wait a bit more before we 're together again . You see there are those in Rome who would have me branded an outlaw . So I have sent Mark Antony to talk to the senate on my behalf . Since there has
zone2	who would return to Rome without taking her by force , I too must be planning such an assault , .. but my crime is worse Because I return not in dishonor , but in triumph . And this the senate can not tolerate . How long ago did Sulla ride into town with his army , Breaking the sacred Roman law stating no man ! Must bring armed men past the Rubicon into Rome . How fresh in your memories does bloodshed have to be ? For you to show caution . Caesar has done more for Rome than any other general in its history . How do you respond ... You strip him of his councilship in his absence without explanation . He 's more than doubled the size of Rome in the last eight years and what do you ask him to do . Lay down his arms . It 's not Caesar , who is the criminal . It is this senate ! This senate represents the people of Rome . This senate , represents its own interests . Sulla said the very same thing .
zone2	the difference between Sulla and Caesar is The people feared Sulla , Caesar they love .. You know nothing of people 's feelings . Your right I do n't . Let me ask them . People of Rome , I come to you with questions from Caesar . He needs to know what you want so he can better serve your need . The senate says they represents the people . But the senate wants Caesar to lay down his arms , and return to Rome as a man , Not as a soldier . And when he arrives , the senate will find him guilty of crimes against the state . Caesar 's crime is spending eight years in battle , outside of Rome , With none of the comforts we take for granted with a daily treat to his life . Why ? So he can bring wealth to the Roman people . Temples , libraries , holidays and games ... are all funded by Cesars levies in Gaul . Yet what do they think in the senate ? They think he 's doing this for personal gains
zone2	private gain , Why does he stay in Gaul ? Why does he live in a tent ? I , know why he does it . He does it so we , Romans , can live well . What are you going to do about this ? Whatever these men may think , some of whom have never been up on a horse 's back , I have never known a man tougher on the enemies of Rome nor gentler to his friends . When I call myself a Roman , The thing that makes me most proud , Is to share that title with one other man . A man who it has been my privilege to fight beside . A man that has shown time and again That he loves his own life less than he loves yours . His name is Gaius Julius Caesar ! We must do something , Pompey . Caesar could march on Rome any time . I 'm not going to wait for him to come to us , I 'll gather our troops . And attack him before he sets foot in
zone2	legions off the face of the earth . Men , we have two choices . We can be slaughtered by the army Pompey is massing against us . Or we can fight for our lives , Just as we have done every day for eight years . I 've made my decision . I 'm going to Rome . I 'm going to cross the Rubicon . Will anyone be coming with me ? To Rome ! Let the dice fly . My legions from Spain should bear up to Austria from the west . The Thracians will come to us from the north . and from the east the Macedonians . Caesar is on his way to Rome . How far is he ? - Four days from here . That 's impossible ! - I heard it from Bibulus himself . Caesar has passed the Rubicon . We must leave Rome . We can not defend it without troops . We 'll go to Greece . We 'll amass what strength we can , And then we 'll take him in Rome itself . I only hope we
zone2	our friends on the senate steps . It has been decreed by the new senate That the title of dictator is bestowed on Gaius Julius Caesar . It is decreed there will be fifty days of thanksgiving in his honor . He is given the courts and elected consol for life . Hail Caesar ! You treat me as a king . Though I assure that is one role I shall never adopt . I am Caesar , and only Caesar . It is for this crown alone I conquered Gaul . Caesar ... Caesar ! Beware the Ides of March . The Ides of March . Beware . The men and women of Rome are crying out for your head . For a moment , I saw them as you do . You do n't know how I see them . I was disgusted with them . How do you keep your purpose clear in your mind ? When I met you in your village , I could see you had your purpose clear in your mind . And it was pure . I can see that it has
zone2	? You want to know ? Yes . I only fight my enemies . You think we are similar , Do n't you ? That 's why it pains you to see me die . We are very different , you and me . I know when its over . And what 's left is n't worth having . Give me the honor of dying alone , by my own hand . Instead of in a public spectacle of your Roman mob . I have to do what the people want , I have no choice . I thought power gave you more choice , not less . Listen to them . Do you hear that ? For pity sake , give me a sword . Hail Caesar . The ranks here are depleted . My men will be joining you . How shall we explain to the people That these men have become senators ? They have n't been selected by the provisional leaders The law is changed . And keep in mind the people trust my judgment . You will be joined by my finest men . I
zone2	must leave for Greece to fight Pompey . I 'm leaving Rome in Mark Antony 's capable charge . - Do we have no say in this ? I do n't want to distract you with bureaucracy . I 'd rather leave you free to argue matters of the state . You think there will be black lists ... There wo n't be any lists . Sulla killed his enemies , I forgive mine . Good day to you , gentlemen . They left in a hurry . Attention Caesar ! I did not cross the Rubicon to kill old friends . I did it to protect myself against my enemies . I hope we can secure ourselves through mercy and not vengefulness . Your all free to go . - We owe , all our lives to Caesar . Did you say something , my old friend ? I thought I heard you speak . I 'm grateful for your clemency . Brutus , come dine with me . Caesar ... make peace with Pompey . For years , His only hope was that one day , You would
zone2	Julia , uniting you both . He tolerated me , Because he loved Julia so much . Caesar he loved Julia because he saw you in her . He told me that Julia 's death made life unbearable . And add to that the end of your friendship . He counted his life as finished . I 'll make peace with him if peace is what you want . I want to establish some sanity in Rome . The people had enough of fighting . Will you help me ? - How can I help you ? I want you to go back to Rome and be my pr ? teur . If peace is what you want , Then it will be my honor to serve you . Pompey has gone to Egypt . The king died , leaving throne to be squabbled over by a twelve year old boy and eighteen year old girl . Ptolemy and Cleopatra ? I do n't know which one I trust less . Help me ready the ships . I 'll follow him in the morning . You do n't need to
zone2	alone . the troops went to Utica . With your uncle Cato ? - Yes . Trust me , Brutus . Whoever wants peace , will have it . He was most cruelly murdered on the palace steps by his own men . It 's rumored that they were bribed by Pothinus . By Caesar . There 's only one enemy left . I am Pothinus , chief of the ruling counsel . In the name of king Ptolemy , I welcome you , Caesar . Your king is very generous , But as you can see , we have n't brought any horses . This grain is for your men sir . My men will eat indoors , Pothinus . I 'm sure you will put us up very comfortably , in your palace . I 'll tell you the truth , Caesar . Ptolemy fears for his life . There 's been a great deal of discord in Egypt . So he has forbidden all visitors . You , of course , are very welcome in the palace . And my men . And your men . Pothinus
zone2	the king make his decisions ? Would you ? - The king is a boy sir . Forgive him , and forgive me . We are your allies and your servants great Caesar . We only have the interests of Rome in our hearts . Bring out the gift . This is Pompey 's ring ... Where is he ? We thought you 'd be pleased . Excuse me , Caesar . There is a servant with an urgent message from Cleopatra . Bring her . If you want to hear the message you 'll have to dismiss your guard . What word from Cleopatra is of such importance ? Cleopatra asks for your protection . Protection , why ? Pothinus plans to kill her , as he did Pompey . Is that why you are disguised as your own servant Cleopatra ? I came to you , Caesar , Because you are the only man I can trust . Why does Pothinus want to kill you ? My father wanted me to rule Egypt , he wrote it in his will . But Pothinus banished me with a price
zone2	and be rewarded for it . Caesar ... You and I , are alike . You are the son of Venus , and I , am the daughter of Isis . You and I , live by the same divine heart beat . That 's why we must help each other . - Are you trying to seduce me ? I do n't try . I seduce or I do n't . I do not have to seduce with my body . I have something much better than that . My country It is the richest land in the world . Egypt and Rome are different . Rome is masculine . Egypt is feminine . Rome , is sunlight , Egypt is twilight . But its not part of Rome not yet . Make me queen , and the east and west will be united . We will be god and goddess ruling the world . You kiss me with the tongue of a serpent . I must test you to see if you are poison . And am I ? - No , but I can taste Gaul .
zone2	What does Egypt have to offer That Rome does not ? - Have you heard of the fertile crescent ? Is it the region down below ? - It is it is ! What grows there ? I believe the region fertile . When you return to Rome , you must be fateful to me . But I 'm married , I 'm , already being unfaithful . - ... with you ! - Let 's go . Demand you give yourself to a woman . In politics you lie you 're unfaithful . - We 'll bury him with honors . I 'll bury him myself Let the state celebrate his life . - Which state ? Rome ? The Rome of Caesar ? To accept your honors would defile my name . And on behalf of my father and my family , I decline . Now I 'm asking you to leave this room . There is no peace in the world like in my house . Calpurnia
zone2	Dismiss them . Ca n't a man return to his home and expect a warmer mood from his wife ? How could you bring her to Rome ? It was for the good of the state . Cleopatra rules a large part of Africa . And all of you . No one rules me Calpurnia . Not Cleopatra , not even you . But what I want is the love that you promised me when we married . You ca n't have it . You can have my obedience , you can have my loyalty . But I ca n't love those who dishonor me . No one can dishonored you . - You 're right I dishonored myself When I gave my vows to you in marriage . - You made a good marriage you 're Caesar 's wife ! I should have married a man other than Caesar , That would have been a good marriage . So I would n't have to watch my husband perform for Egypt every night , in order to keep the riches of that land flowing into Rome . Between you and
zone2	! Retain your dignity there 's a limit to what I 'll hear from you . I have no dignity left . Perhaps I ought to buy some . Maybe I should learn like you have , that you can be bought and sold . What 's the price ? What 's the price of consulship these days ? What 's the price of being king ? When did your hope leave and vision for the people become this lust for power itself ? Was it when Julia died ? I have nowhere else to go so I 'll stay here . But I 'll live apart from you , not as man and wife . May the gods forgive me for breaking my marriage vows . But I pray they forgive you for breaking yours . You 're an early riser , Brutus . So are you . Lately I am . I could n't sleep last night worrying about the honor of your name . You know something about these ? I know the writing , but do n't ask me who wrote them . Minds change quickly
zone2	whoever doubt these men . Oh Brutus I did my best to persuade them that you are a man of honor , Though you would n't pledge to keep Caesar from becoming king . I gave you my pledge that I 'd oppose him in the senate . But some of us feel that to oppose a man like Caesar with words is the same thing as handing him the crown . I try to use words before the sword , Cassius . Just as I try to use reason before passion . People say , calling on reason before passion can lead to idleness . And sometimes action is required . But I know that you 're a decent man And that your meek and gentle nature is how you feel you best serve the good . I 'm not gentle in defending my beliefs . But you have given me no proof that Caesar will demand the crown . Do you plan to be at the senate at the calendes of March ? No , I will be here . They say that on that day Caesar will
zone2	if I am sent for . - Ha ha ! This is what they mean . People say that this is weakness to come when you are summoned and at no other time . To accept the favors of a tyrant like Caesar . He spared my life . - But he took the life of Cato , Your wife 's father , who treated you as a son . Has she ceased her mourning ? No , and neither have I . So you 're grieving over Cato 's death ... - Cassius , yes I 'm grieving . But private affection and public duty are not the same thing . And yet they say that in your grief , you just weep and say prayers and fill your wife 's drinking cup and go to bed . And when Caesar comes to you tonight you 'll be like his boy and fill his cup as well ... Who is saying this ? Who ? I do n't act for Caesar . I act for Rome , ... always for Rome . Brutus I 've done everything to convince
zone2	Rome . I 've spoken in your behalf many times singing your praise , condemning those who speak against you . But ... some men have ideas . They think highly of those who gave their lives to expel the kings from Rome . Your ancestors ! And they were only men , not gods . Please do n't stay . - I am staying . Why do you want to torment yourself ? - I wo n't be tormented . Will he ? Is n't that what you wanted to do ? It will be the best thing for all . I do n't trust that you or any other man knows what 's best for Rome . I will take my seat . A woman has a right to see varity , does n't she ? Calpurnia ... Portia ... Romans we 're here to celebrate the return of Caesar ! His return , not only with her majesty Cleopatra , But with Egypt itself . Where he has transformed the richest land in all the world . It is now not only Egypt , . It is
zone2	and I will say again ... I will not be king of Rome . I an only Caesar . I need no crown to act on your behalf . Do you still believe that ours is not just cause ? I 'm with you . We have to act soon . We will wait when Caesar brings the senate to order . Lepide will call for the elections . Casca , you will ask Caesar to consider the petitions . You , Cassius , will step behind Caesar . No man should go for his blade until we 're all in reach of Caesar . Every knife must enter Caesar 's body at least once . And if , .. we fail , our plot is discovered before we even begin , we turn our knives on ourselves , ... without hesitation . We all agreed ? For the senate . I will meet with Caesar at Cleopatra 's house . Go . Brutus ... Why are you pacing like that ? - I 'm concerned we will be late . Caesar ! Calpurnia , What are you doing here
zone2	n't go out today . I 'll come to you later , at our home . I saw you slaughtered , in your own blood . It was horrible . Well I can not let dreams or flights of birds direct my actions . I ca n't let you go . I swallow my pride today to come to you , Because your life is more important to me than my pride . Now you listen to me ... The senate is conviened for the consul . They ca n't conduct one day of business without their Caesar ? There are matters on the agenda which can only be dealt with by you Caesar . They can wait a day . - And what should I tell the senate ? That their consul is at home , because his wife had a bad dream ... As your friend Caesar , I have to advise you on this . You called the senate together . Show them you 're a man of intention . Meet with your senate . They are waiting for your guidance . I 'll be with him
zone2	'll come to you later . Hail Caesar ! Portia ... I 'm not fit to be alone today . Sit down . Bring us some wine . - Yes , let 's have some wine . What business do we have today ? Two legal briefings , And election for a questeur , and the petitions from the senate . Let 's get the election out of the way . - The election I move we take the petitions , first . I called for the election the election will commence . But a ... Marcus Octavius , who is running for the office , is not yet here . Petitioners , then . Approach . I 'm glad Caesar is with Brutus today . Why ? Last night I dreamt , He was stabbed to death . Brutus ... Caesar , I ask mercy for my exiled brother . Why are you petitioning what so recently has been denied ? Who is the next petitioner ? I want to ask mercy for my father who has been put in jail . I ruled your father be in prison

Well then , would you mind changing me back before you go ? Remember ? I used to be taller . I 'm afraid only the Sugarplum Princess can reverse the Mouse King 's spell . The Sugarplum Princess ? Yes . I 've been trying to find her since the Mouse King turned me into a nutcracker . You mean , you used to be ... Not a nutcracker . Perhaps I can help . You will find the Sugarplum Princess on an island , across the Sea of Storms . But it 's impossible to cross the Sea of Storms . It 's dangerous , yes , but not impossible . - Well ,

But , yes . - Where are we ? - Must 've taken a wrong turn back there . - Where did my sword go ? - Here , let me give you a hand . - Uh ... - Sorry . That happens a lot . - A firefly ? - No .

Soon it 'll all be a memory if the Mouse King has his way . And you 're sure the Sugarplum Princess can help ? She 's our only hope of defeating him . Hm ! Interesting . Well ? What news do you bring ? I wish I could remember , but I 'm so hungry . I feel weak , no faint ... You insolent little bat ! I should turn you into a ceiling fan ! That would be a shame . Then I could n't tell you the juicy bit of gossip I overheard . Thank you very much , Your Most Royal Majesty . May I say you 're looking specially regal this evening , Sire . Er , right . Well for starters , Nutcracker 's back . What ? Here ? And he 's got some girl with him . Do n't know where she came from . I do . Now
zone2	a Sugarplum Princess who can , supposedly , defeat ... you . Err ... according to the Nutcracker . Sugarplum Princess ? I 've never heard of a Sugarplum Princess . Bring me the royal registery . And bring me the Nutcracker . It 's what 's left of the Gingerbread Village . Mouse King 's work , no doubt . I did n't know things had gotten this bad . Steady ! We wo n't hurt you . It 's an ambush ! Take cover ! It 's alright . They 're just children . With very good aim . Wait ! We found this . Is she yours ? Patty ! What happened here ? We went out with Marzipan to gather candle berries . - We came back and everything ... - ... and everyone ... - ... were gone ! It was the Mouse King 's Army . This is all Prince Eric 's fault . Who 's Prince Eric ? The son of the King who ruled before the Mouse took over . Yeah , but he was n't much of a Prince . The
zone2	Royal Advisor . The Mouse . Until the Price could prove himself worthy . Let me guess . The Mouse decided he liked being King . But what happened to Prince Eric ? - Do n't know , do n't care . - We 're better off without him . It 's dangerous here . We 'll travel together until we can find you a safe home . The Mouse King 's Army . Carrying what 's left of our village . There they are ! Come on ! Come on , into the woods ! They 're getting closer ! Up here ! Get ' em ! Is everyone alright ? I 'm not really sure . Well , what have we here ? A wooden spy ? Some new kind of Mouse King trap ? - Kidnappers , as well . - No ! They helped us ! If you have nothing to hide , you wo n't mind answering a few questions . Come , children . Masha will take care of you . Let 's start with who you are and what you 're doing here
zone2	're both victims of the Mouse King 's magic . We 're trying to find the only one who can defeat him : the Sugarplum Princess . The Sugarplum Princess ? I 've never heard such a ridiculous story ! It 's the truth . Told to me by Prince Eric himself . Ha ! Prince Eric ! He 's the reason we 're in the mess . If it were n't for that reckless boy , the Mouse King would n't be turning everyone into knick-knacks . You make the Prince sound pretty awful . Awful ? That 's a compliment . He was useless , lazy , and irresponsible ... Major Mint , you 're forgetting that Prince Eric was my friend . Captain Candy , you 're forgetting that I am your superior . I had high hopes for that boy . Oh , no matter . I 've got more important things to think about , like ... keeping what 's left of our subjects safe from the Mouse King ! Then perhaps you should be looking for the Princess too . I do n't have
zone2	whatever . - Sugarplum . - Imaginary Princess . Wait , Major ! They may be telling the truth . I once overheard the King telling Prince Eric about this powerful Princess . The King Himself believed in her magic . And we 've tried everything else to defeat the Mouse . Do you know where she is ? We 've learned she 's on an island , across the Sea of Storms . Oh , very well . We 'll all go looking for the Sugarplum Princess . But I 'll be in charge of the expedition ! Of course . - Do you know what became of Prince Eric ? - The Mouse King destroyed him . So , you 're telling me that the Nutcracker , a wooden utensil , managed to escape a well-armed fighting squadron unharmed ? And instead of fleeing into the hills , you chose to return to me and report your incompetence . Yeah-huh . ( Gulp ) Why do n't you just blast ' em with your scepter , Sire ? I suppose I could . But I find its power
zone2	is : making you useful . Pimm . - How are we doing with statuary ? - Eh , full up , your Lordiness . - Lawn ornaments ? - Too much ornament , not enough lawn . - Paperweights ? - Covered . What does one create for the palace that has everything ? - How ' bout bookends since there 's two of ' em . - Wonderful idea , Pimm . I do believe I 'm starting to rub off on you . " Since other tasks posed a challenge to thee , you shall be bookends for eternity ! " Here it is . " The Sugarplum Princess : Kind , clever , and brave . " ! That 's it ? ! Where is she ? I suppose I 'll just have to reduce the Nutcracker to a pile of splinters before he can find her . " Rock that will walk , destroy whom I seek , carnage and havoc will be yours to wreak ! " Find the wooden man and crush him ! Follow him , Pimm . He 's a bit
zone2	You want me to babysit a rock ? Alright , alright ! Better than being a rock . What about Marzipan ? I 'm sure she 'll be fine . And you 'll be staying here with Masha until we get back . - Okay ? - Okay . - Goodnight . - Goodnight , Clara ! Ca n't sleep ? I 'm a nutcracker . Sleep seems kind of pointless . You 're more than a nutcracker , Prince Eric . Why have n't you told anyone ? I-I did n't want to be the price when I had the chance . Now I do n't deserve to be . That 's not true ! You 're risking your life to save your kingdom . Is n't that what Princes do ? But my subjects think less of me than they do the Mouse King . My only hope is to find the Sugarplum Princess so she can help me restore my peoples ' happiness . I owe them that . Aha ! There 's our bridge . Perhaps we should find a safer place to cross . Perhaps
zone2	. Heh heh ! Right-o . No problem at all . Heh heh , come along . Tricky . Help ! Please , hurry ! I 'll be gobstrack . Hurry ! Sorry . Did n't have any rope . - Are you sure you 're alright to travel ? - I 'm fine . Please , do n't worry about me . Bad luck about your knapsack . Now we 'll be needing more supplies ! Supplies ? Thanks to you , I almost fell into the ravine ! Do n't blame me for your sloppy footwork , General Clumsiness . Clumsy ? I 'm clumsy ? - You 're the bundling clod-hopper ! - Who was dangling from a branch ? Whose leadership skills put me there ? - That was very noble of you . - Least I could do for an old friend . The Captain and I will make a boat sea worthy , while you two gather supplies . Clara , come with me . The well used to be over there . Here it is . Well , somebody must 've capped it
zone2	destroyed this valley and trapped them in the well . What ? They say you 're beautiful . Supplies ! Run ! Major ! Captain ! What 's she carrying on about now ? Probably saw a snake or a spider or a ... Rock giant ! Great googly ! There he is ! Right there ! Blimey , I 'm blind as a bat and even I can see him ! Major , Captain , over here ! I worked on that sail a good half hour ! You cheeky blighter ! Why do n't you invite him over for tea and cakes while you 're at it ! Look ! It 's Marzipan ! Come on , before the Snow Fairies disappear ! Ah , he 'll break right through that ice ! It seems the Snow Fairies did their job too well . A sword 's not going to do you any good , lad . You 'll be pulverized ! - Be careful ! - Do n't worry , wood floats ... rock does n't ! - Hurry ! Hurry ! - Put some zing in
zone2	'll never find the Princess 's island . And if we do n't ? You battled the Mouse Army , rescued Captain Candy , and saved us from a vicious pile of rock ! All without the Sugarplum Princess . The Mouse King is too powerful to take on alone . Besides , we 've got ta find the Princess if you 're to return home your true size . - That is what you want , is n't it ? - Of course . Nutcracker destroyed rock ? And sent him to the bottom of the sea . Of course he had some help . Major Mint and Captain Candy have joined up . Proving they 're gullible idiots . I 've combed through every page of every book in the Royal Library , and there 's no other mention of a Sugarplum Princess . I do n't know . They were pretty keen on finding her island . She 's a fantasy ! But if Nutcracker wants to believe in fairy tales , he 's about to find out this one does n't have a happy ending .
zone2	. Wait ! It 's too dangerous ! There 's been no sign of this mysterious island . Not to mention what 's going to happen when this ice starts to melt . Marzipan saw something . I 'm sure of it . No time to enjoy the scenery . Let 's find this Princess . I believe the Nutcracker has earned the right to lead us . But-but ... he 's wood ! And the reason we 've made it this far . I 'm only half the reason . Handing the reigns to a-a stump ! I never heard of such a thing ! - Are you coming ? - Oh , yes . - Gotcha mates ! Off to the palace ! - No ! Wait a minute . Where 's the girl ? Do n't matter . No way off this island . Unless she 's part mermaid . I should never have come . What was I thinking ? That I was going to find a magical Princess ? I could always go back home . I 'm sure I 've got some doll clothes
zone2	ca n't leave . I 'm their only hope . If I could just get off this island . Hello ! Are you sure about this ? Okay then . Let 's go-ooo ! Thank you . They 're right . It 's time we stood up to the Mouse . More wood . I want this to be an unforgettable show . Pimm , all is right with the world . I got the Nutcracker and soon my worries will be over . Well , that ai n't really so true , Sire . Oh ? - It seems your subjects are planning an uh ... uprising . - What ? ! I want every last villager , fairy , and general trouble-maker rounded up to witness this display of my absolute power ! I 'll get right on it , Sire . Ah , Sire ? I ca n't feel my toes . Oh , there you are ! The King needs you right away in the courtyard . And he said if you did n't hurry , you 'd spend the rest of your lives as houseflies
zone2	's wrong with the girl ? - We can see her , but she ca n't see us . Or hear us , apparently . Why would the Mouse King post guards on an empty room ? Clara . We 've got to get out of here . The Mouse King 's building a bonfire . I doubt it 's to warm up the palace . Sugarplum Princess or no Sugarplum Princess , that rat 's got to be stopped ! - Is this any way to run a Kingdom , Mouse ? - Ahh . You 're just in time for your party . There 's more to being a King than having a crown ! Suddenly you 're an expert . You 'll never gain their loyalty until you 've earned their respect ! I do n't need their loyalty . I do n't even need them . " Those peasants who do challenge me , living statuary be ! " Clara ! Scrappy little Nutcracker . I 'm afraid I 've underestimated you . " With the brawn of twenty and six I 'll smash my enemy
zone2	a choice , Nutcracker , dismemberment or barbeque . No ! You 're nothing but a coward , hiding behind a magic wand ! I obviously did n't shrink you small enough . Your mouth is still much too big . But that is about to change . " To the one who vexes me , smaller , smaller you will be ! " Nooo ! What ? Ahh ! Back to where he belongs - The sewer ! Oh ! My poor Nutcracker . Do n't worry , Clara , I 'm just wood . Remember ? You and I know you 're much more than that . Prince Eric . - It 's Prince Eric ! - The Prince ? ! The Prince . - Of course . The Princess has been with us all along ! - What ? - Clara , it 's you ! You are the Sugarplum Princess ! - Me ? I could n't be . It all makes sense . You saved me from the Mouse King in your parlor . You rescued us from his dungeon , your bravery led to
zone2	. - You are the Sugarplum Princess ! - Look ! You 've broken all the Mouse King 's evil enchantments . And now you 're free to take your rightful place as King . Well , that 's for the people to decide . - Three cheers for Prince Eric ! - Hip hip , hurray ! Hip hip , hurray ! Hip hip , hurray ! Thank you , friends . As your King , I will let the wise leadership of my Father be my guide . None of this would 've been possible without you , Clara . Will you stay ... and be my Queen ? This locket was supposed to take me home , but in my heart , I feel I 'm already there . I absolutely despise happy endings ! - No ! - No ! He 's not gon na get away with that ! Pimm ! Flap , you fool ! - Clara ! No ! - Eric ! - Clara ! I love you ! Nutcracker ? It 's about time you got up . I see the mice
zone2	was n't a party . It was a war . The Nutcracker was fighting the Mouse King , who shrunk me with his golden scepter . I 've never heard such a story , even from your Aunt ! It 's not a story ! It really happened ! - Time to open presents ! - Tommy , did you take my Nutcracker ? - Why would I want him ? He 's just a hunck of wood . - You 're wrong ! He 's really a King . An evil mouse was ruling his land . - The mouse had a bat . - What 's all this foolishness ? Perhaps I should send for a doctor . And this is where I grew up . Aunt Elizabeth , have you seen my ... Nutcracker ? Look who I ran into while I was taking my morning stroll . Uncle Drosselmayer , Clara , Tommy . This is Eric , the son of a dear friend of mine . I 'm very happy to ... meet you . Such familiarity ! In my day we would never have
zone2	stay for Christmas dinner . But this is a most ... wonderful idea . I suppose it would n't hurt to have the young man stay for supper . But what about the presents ? May I have this dance ? I could n't say no to the King . So , if Clara had n't been brave , she never would 've found out she was a Princess . That 's right . Can you help me practice until I know all the steps ? Of course . - I did it ! - I always knew you could . English script typed in by WordFaery

We have been runners-up before , but first is first , and second is nowhere . I want you to train the team , use your professional experience . Well , I have n't played football for years , and ... I 'm a little bit out of condition at the moment . I pulled a lot of strings to get you assigned to my prison . I 'm sorry . I 'm just not your man . We 'll stick a pin in it for now .

Take him back to solitary . - Have a nice week 's holiday ? - Yeah , lovely . - There is a way out . - What ? Listen , convince the governor the best way to train the guards is to play a tough match against a team of cons with you as the captain . Pro 's always have a pre-season friendly . What do you think , Mr Burton ? Could be a win/win for everybody . Could this work , Meehan ? Yeah , but I need time to prep , and I pick my own team . I could get a real FA ref . There 's one at my golf club . That 'll be good . One more thing : what goes on on the pitch stays on the pitch . - Deal ? - Goes without saying . I am a marketing genius . You 'd better get yourself some rest

Now get out of my sights . - What happened to you ? - Nothing . Sykes ' boys look pretty useful . Do n't even think about it . Who do you think has been stopping everyone from playing ?

Fan club . Bloody stalker . - What 's three across ? - What ? I just saw a bloke pay money for a strip of crossword . Ah , Sykes ! Yeah , three across , four letters : acid . The governor lets Sykes get his " Racing Times " and other papers special delivery . He thinks it helps Sykes work out form and give him tips . He does n't know that they 're pre-soaked in acid . He 's actually smuggling Sykes ' drugs in

Away from the influence of all these criminals , sir . You keep me posted . Oh , look . A monkey learning new tricks . - Why do n't you leave me alone ? - Because I do n't like uppity coons . - Listen , man ... - No , you listen ! - You animal ! - Animal ? You call me a fucking animal ? I 'll open you up like a tin of beans .
zone2	fucking scum ! Are you all right ? He needs a doctor ! Just get a doctor ! That fucking Meehan ! Mr Burton . Have you missed me ? You might be the governor 's pet project , but do n't push it .

What would your old mum say ? Fuck me ! - Wish I 'd met her . - Let 's see how good you are . Sort yourselves out .

On the firm when it suits them , and the next minute they 're all misty-eyed and independent . - l was only saying . - And I 'm saying no . I think we 're going to have to work on the stamina , lads . I 'll pay at the end of the month . No , sweets
zone2	have n't got it . - Sell the nice new Saab then , love . - How do you know about that ? - Pay us or we 'll torch the motor . You can pay us out of the insurance . There you go . Sorted . - l was told that you were reasonable . - Reasonable , sweetheart ? Reasonable is how come you ai n't sitting in your own piss wondering how to get up with smashed knees and elbows , OK ? Big kiss . Looking forward to getting a thrashing ? If it means getting out of here early , I 'll take another beating . Who said anything about a beating ? I 'm talking about the match . Come on ! I 've seen your lot in action . I do n't run my ship like that . Are you making a complaint ? No . Lock it up ! What 's the matter ? Did you have a nice chat with your chum Burton ? Ai n't you got any hobbies ? - You sleep with one eye open , son
zone2	. I 've been wondering . You need a manager . You know , the the tactics and all that . Well , I am the bollocks . Massive 's manager . Yeah , I know , but I 'm better than him because I had trials , did n't I . We all had trials . That 's why we 're here . Fuck off ! Fuck off ! Football trials , yeah ? I could be the physio . No , no , I could be the pharmacist . Get the lads pepped up and all that bollocks . I do n't think so , mate . Good job he likes you . He blew up five people , he did n't . They 're slags . They wo n't even let me in their poxy squad . I do n't give a fuck about their poxy squad , do you understand me ? If you want out of this fucking prison , you got ta come up with something to spoil their little party . Otherwise you 're fucked . OK , relax . Be in the

Search him . - What are you looking at , freak ? - You were grassed up . That dodgy Meehan is getting well pally with Mr Burton . I 've seen them talking . - What are you doing ? - No one likes a grass . - What do you mean ? - The big man 's right . We 'll see what we can do about them beady eyes . - Chiv , you know it was n't me ! - You know it 's not me ! Which one am I going to burst ? You choose - the left or the right ? - For fuck 's sake ! - Go on , pop it ! - Hold him ! - Hurry up , Jock bastard . - Who are you calling a Jock bastard ? - You ! - l cut myself shaving . - Nosebleed . lt 's

Not against Sykes ' word . Not that some of them would n't be up for it . What makes you bulletproof ? He 's not . But he 's pally with the bloke that Sykes is cagey about . - Who ? - The Monk . That dude is beyond mental . And so are his pals on the outside . Sykes , he wants a smooth flow . All he really cares about is profit . - What money ? - You 're a betting man . We 'll make a deal
zone2	you call the result . Bet accordingly . Back to your fixing the match routine , right ? Now , listen . lt 's like this - l 'd never take a bet against England , and I would n't bet the screws against the cons . Capisce ? Then we can play to win . - Would you think about it ? - Yes , I 'll think about it . But right now I 'm thinking you 're polluting my air . Now go away . - How did it go ? - lt did n't . Here , Dan . Dan , um ... - l 've been thinking . - Leave the thinking to me . Yeah , yeah , of course , Dan , yeah . Well , what it is , Dan ... What , what ... I was wondering if ...

zone2	. Well done ! Yeah , squad , squad ! Well in ! You told me they were reasonable . They are , but they 're businessmen . You got me into this , and you can get me out . Hey ! I opened the door , you walked through it . You 've been making money ever since . So , why have n't you got it ? It is just a temporary cash flow problem . The team is bleeding me dry . Well , get it sorted . Because this lot have a bad habit of turning cash flow problems into blood flow problems . I used to do double this just for a warm-up . Anno Domini , mate . I used to be able to piss in one go and then forget about it for the rest of the morning . Bloody hell . You never did say how come it ai n't done your nut in , being in so long . Only does your nut in if you do n't think you should be here . Look at me . Sweet old
zone2	, cornerstone of the nick , put in with the foundations , right ? Right . I did n't get to be the oldest lag for breaking windows . Villains spend their lives shitting themselves that other criminals are going to see to them . So they get their retaliation in first and twice as nasty . A bloke was coming after me , so I ... I went around to his digs and lobbed a grenade in the window . Left over after the war , you know , army surplus . I did n't know , but he had his little nipper and his bird in there with him . The house went up like Guy Fawkes ' Night . No one came out . He 'd barricaded the door with furniture in case I came around . By the time they got in , the screaming had stopped . 1 3 months old , learning to walk , apparently . Nothing I can do is ever going to make up for that , is it ? - You 're on . - What 's that , a
zone2	humour . I know Nitro is the grass , not you . - One thing : you fight one of my boys . - Fight ? A little earner I stage now and then . I ca n't be seen to be giving you a free ride . - Fight who ? - Fight him . - Soft as puppy shit , Nick is . - l 'm an ex-footballer , not a boxer . So ? Kick him . An eye for an eye , you bastard . - Fucking eye for a fucking ... - Boo ! - Do n't you do that again . - Calm down , silly bollocks . You seem to be making more enemies by the minute . Yeah ? Well , I want out of this shit house ! Please ! Please ! You 're half way home , son . I 'm taking you down to segregation now . - That 's why I 'm here . - Yeah ? - Yeah . - Just give me a transfer , sir , please . Please , please . Silverino Sands ,

Walk away . Mass , this is the only way we 're gon na get these boys to play . In the dirty brown corner , with a record of 35 and 0 all coming by the way of the big KO . The heavy duty champion of the penal world Ketch , the Black Country Bastard . Come on . Come on . And in the other , equally dirty brown corner , we have the challenger , formerly known as the " Mean Machine " - Danny " l 've had more backhanders than Boris bleeding Becker " Meehan ! Yeah ! Gentlemen , it 's alternate punches , followed by one mug of five-star prison cognac . Cheers . No using your left hand , no butting , biting , spitting , poking or kissing , you . It 's

Keep your head up . I 'm in here for drunken assault . Yeah ! First , I 'd like to welcome Mr Sykes ' boys . Watch this . Go on . Hey ! OK , if you wan na do that , join a circus . It 's no good to us . We need 1 1 men to play as a team . Right ? - Right ! - Yes ! That 's lovely , Dan . Well in . Right ! OK , positions . I play centre midfield . Let 's have all midfield players behind me , defenders to me left , strikers to me right . Come on , lads , come on . Terrific . Let 's move on . That 's good . Now pass it . Pass it , Trojan
zone2	game . Pass to our team . He 's too greedy . OK , fellas . Now , the key to set pieces is concentration , calculation , teamwork . With corners it 's about movement , drawing defenders out of position . When it comes to defending , it 's about tackling , finesse , calculation . Remember these simple rules , and we 're in with a chance . Any questions ? Lovely story . Yeah . We still need a goalkeeper . Somebody to boss the defence about . There 's one man I know who could boss our def ... No , no . Fuck that . - That 's not even worth thinking about . - Who ? - No , no , you 'll laugh your head off . - Who ? - The Monk . - Monk ? Can he play ? They say he could have turned pro , before he turned mad . - How mad is he ? - He 's the Jock that even the Jocks fear . - What did he do ? - Something very dark up
zone2	. Not even the Pope could get him out of the special wing . The Monk is in the high security wing . So do me a favour . Maybe I can help you with Barry the Bookie . I 'm listening . Bet the game , your guards to win . Price is right , we 'll make a killing . You pay off Barry , and have some left . Take the missus to Malaga . - This is so illegal . - l think criminal 's the word . All right , big man ? Sound . Danny Meehan , he 's all right , know what I mean ? He 's got a wee favour to ask you . - Hello , Mr Monk . Can you play football ? - Aye . Good . Would you like to play with us ? Nah . We 're playing the guards . - Aye . Then I 'm with you . - Sound . Thanks a lot , Mr Monk . OK , let 's try it . Troj , you take the corner . It 's
zone2	on , Troj . Yeah , yeah . To me , Troj . It 's Mouse 's ball . My ball . Yeah . - He 's broke my bloody nose . - Let me have a look . What ? - He did that on purpose . - No , he didn't . - Yes , he did . - Tell him ... Tell him it was an accident . Right , it was an accident . - Now , get yourself off over the back there . - He said it was an accident . You 're not worried about the opposition , are you , Mr Burton ? A team of life 's losers led by a man who can be bought and sold ? I do n't think so . Not when the game 's about character . We 'll give you a match . You 'll give us a game . Doubt whether you can match us . We 'll see . One , two , three ... Look up , pass it . Look up again . Well done ! Let the ball do
zone2	, look up . Start again . Spread out . Up , down ... Up , down ... Come on . One , two , three , four ... And left , and right . And left , and right ... Hurry it up there . I told you two to keep the centre tight . I 've always told you to wear tie-ups on your socks . Now you , get over there and mark up . And you , bugger off . Now listen , Daniel , I 'm not putting you under pressure , right . I 'm burning up phone cards , taking bets from prisons up and down the country . Oh , no . Despite what the governor thinks , I 'm betting us to win . So my arse is on the line . And by my arse , I mean your arse . - OK , I need a volunteer . - Yeah . - Dan . - Yeah , all right , Bill . Help Monk and Chiv with their demonstration . - Lovely . - Cheers . Aye , right
zone2	are screws . So if anybody 's gon na play dirty , it 's gon na be they fuckers . Here 's one or two wee examples , just to keep us a step ahead . Numero uno : the accidental treading on the toe . It 's an obvious one , but it works . Ah , fuck ! Numero two . Right , daftie , run towards The Monk . - What now ? - On you go , half pace ? The cunningly titled " elbow in the face " . Very effective , but you tend to get sent off . So if you use it , make sure the ref 's not looking . - Number four . - Wait . What happened to number three ? Number four : when you 're helping him up , grab the hairs under his armpits and twist them round . - Hurts like a bastard , does n't it ? - Yeah . - Number five . - Wait , I 'm gon na sit down . I do n't wan na hog it . Let one
zone2	right . You 're the man . You 're hard . Get in there . Yeah , as it happens , yeah . No , go on , yeah . And finally , the pi ? ce de r ? sistance , number 23 . I ca n't . Monk , stop , I 'm in a bad way , mate . Monk , I ca n't breathe . Ah , fuck ! The guillotine . Come on , let 's move on . Get yourself up . You 're making the place look untidy . - Was that all right though ? - Cream . Well done . Finish with a bit of shooting practice . Troj , you lay them off . Massive , marks out of ten . You 've done well with that lot . Passes the time , Doc . You know , it 's not a crime to admit enjoying it . You 're becoming a sentimental old fart . That bloody Meehan . Who does he think he is ? Do n't you worry about Meehan . I 've got something sorted for
zone2	. You ca n't put me back on the wing . - You scratch my back , I 'll scratch yours . - Sykes will fucking kill me . You know the itch I want scratching . I do n't want Meehan on that pitch , understand ? OK . I know what needs to be done . Nice and easy . Right down the middle . And a one , and a two . And a three . Good shot . Good shot . Where have you been ? The governor 's been waiting . I 'll take him in . OK , miss . I 've thought of a way I can really help you . - The sad old twat videos all their games . - Really ? And I 've written some pointers . My own little dossier on the guards . I 'm sure you 'll find it very interesting . Now hurry up , we have n't got much time . Quicker . One thing . This is strictly sex . I ai n't gon na respect you after . - Do n't blame
zone2	as well . I 've heard . What ? Easy . - Change her oil , did you ? - Gentlemen should never kiss and tell . - l 'd better go home . - Massive ? Inside information on the opposition . Read it carefully . lt 's important . All right , Danny . There 's a meeting in Mr Sykes ' cell . All right , lads . A bit of wind-up material on the opposition . Ketch , this one 's for you . You know how Ratchett 's going on about his dodgy knee ? It 's the right one . This one is dynamite . Marsden 's daughter , Donna , has been known to dabble in class A drugs . Let him know about it at the right time . Here we go , Danny boy . And now for our secret weapon . - Danny , tape . - Oh , shit , I forgot it . - l left it in my locker . - l 'll get it . Need a slash anyway . Cheers , Doc . Sorry ,
zone2	working . Danny , why did you do it ? Throw that game . Fuck me , Jerome , you do talk too much . - Sorry . - No , you 're all right . It 's funny , but when you 're in that football world , you just do n't realise what it means to people . You only find out how disappointed they are , when you let them down . I was 16 when I signed pro forms . Thought I was the business . Did n't take long for standards to start slipping . Cars , booze , bad tips for slow horses ... You think you can handle it , then bang , very soon it 's handling you . Before I was picking up trophies , I was 425 grand down to men nasty enough ... Well , even they would have put the wind up Mr Sykes . But they did give me two choices . A wheelchair for life , or a deliberate penalty against the Germans . It 's not as if I 've prospered . Look where l
zone2	- l did n't start off out as a youngster , looking to sell my country out . None of us planned to be here , mate . Och , away tae fuck , man . You were a hero in Scotland . Sign it , and I 'll ship you straight out of here . OK . Even down here you ai n't safe from Sykes . He 's put a price on you , sunshine . - Killing Doc , that was a big mistake . - Fuck him . Where am I off to , boys ? HMP Silver Sands , where all the toffs go ? Whatever . - Not exactly , no . - No ? No . You 're catching the ghost train out of here to the funny farm . To the funny farm . Her Majesty 's Prison - Broadhurst . What ? I 'm gon na get you ! Yeah ! I 'm gon na find your house . I 'm gon na blow it up . No , you wo n't . By the time the orderlies have finished with
zone2	nose ! Go on , get in there . I 'm gon na get you ! I reckon you 're quits now , old man . Mean Machine , Mean Machine ... No , do n't you worry about the car . I 'd have my bloody house on this one . Done deal , darlin ' . Yes . Wanker . OK , gentlemen . You 've got 90 minutes to show them that when it comes to physical and mental strength , they ca n't touch us . Most of them are gon na want to mix it up out there . Do n't get involved . All right , lads . You wan na be nothing , numbers , prisoners , that 's fine . But you win today , you 'll have something you remember forever . Talk about it over and over because there are cons that are pig sick at not being here in your shoes . Just to have one crack at those bastards next door . Let 's win , and let 's win well . Lose and they 'll never let
zone2	you 'll have something in here they can never touch . No parole boards , judges or nutcase governors . They 've got one good player , but he 's had his moment . And this is a team game . Now ask yourselves one question ... - Are you ready ? - Yes . - Are we ? - Yes . - Well , come on ! - Yeah ! I 'm looking at each and every one of you lads to get out there and show them who 's boss . Come on ! Hold up for Mr Sykes . Doc was a different generation , and he saved all his life . But before he died , he had me sort out these . Come and get them , lads ! Good afternoon , I 'm Bob Likely . You join us live from the recreation field . I 'm Bob Carter , and thanks again to our esteemed governor ... - Wanker . - ... for providing the splendid facilities that are here today as part of his rehabilitation campaign . And for our audience ,
zone2	It 's a beautiful day . And what a day it is ! And the waiting 's over . The guards are out first , fronted by Mr Burton . And here comes the Mean Machine , led out by our most famous son , Danny Meehan . - Do n't worry . The boys are well up for it . - l 'm not worried . - Where did they get that kit ? - Cheeky bastards . Mean Machine ! Mean Machine ! Skip . - Your call . - Heads . - As we are , then . - OK . This is the one . Take your chances . Do n't start anything . If they do , finish it . OK ? - Yes ! - Come on , lads ! - Let 's wipe the floor with this shite . - Simple ball every time . Boy , Mr Sykes , you look the part . All you need now is a ... lt 's the one we 've all been waiting for . Longmarsh prison guards versus Longmarsh prison cons . It 's
zone2	a free kick to the cons . Ketch has just floored Mr Ratchett . What 's the matter ? Shut up , you pussy ! You fucking bastard ! Well done , Ketch . Just be subtle . Which one 's he then ? Come on , take him out , son ! And Trojan evades Marsden brilliantly . If only he could have done that the night he got nicked . The keeper plays it long . Walker brings it down to the halfway line . It 's a misplaced pass to Jerome McFife , but the ever observant Mr Burton kicks it back to the guards . It 's a neat one-two . Walker to Burton . Back to Walker . He shoots . Just past the post ! Almost . That was a bit too close for comfort . Too fucking close for my liking . Get up there ! Monk plays it out to Meehan . Meehan has the ball in the centre . Goes forward unchallenged . Burton takes Meehan 's legs away . Meehan does not look happy . Now that 's it ,
zone2	you ? You four stand there . Split on my run . I wan na try something . Meehan to take it . Looks like he might chip this one . Right in Ratchett 's crown jewels . It 'll take more than magic sponge to take the sting out of that . Fuck ... me ! Ref , that was bloody deliberate ! Free kick . Handball . Protect yourself at all times . Ten yards ! Ten ! Come away ! Right in his carrots and onions . No nookie for Mr Ratchett . No nookie for Mrs Ratchett neither . Play on ! Just goes to show , lightning can strike twice . Abso-fucking-lutely . 23 minutes of the first half to go , and it 's getting heated out there . Yeah , Bob . Very rock'n'roll . Fuckin ' hell ! - He 's got ta get back in goal . - l ai n't telling him . - Piss off , you Scotch bastard ! - How 's your daughter , by the way ? Donna . Still hanging about on street corners to
zone2	Christ 's sake ! That 's it , fellas , good teamwork . - That was a hard but a fair tackle . - Yeah , it was a fair challenge . But that was n't . This could be dangerous for the cons . It 's a free kick . Do n't think I did n't see it . Ketch has took a strop . And the guards look determined to convert this . Make it count ! The Monk 's collected it cleanly . The Monk - calm and calculated . Looks like the therapy 's paying off . Once again , Monk 's played it to Trojan , who 's again switched to the left . He must be ambidextrous . I do n't know , but he can use both feet . - Goal ! - Yeah ! Goal ! Yeah ! - Beauty ! You beauty ! - Go on , my son . We 're all over them . - One-nil to the Mean Machine . - lt 's the guards to kick off . - lt 's getting tough . - You can
zone2	there , Bob . - Never mind , Bob . Oh no , it looks like the Monk 's at it again . Pass it ! - Do that again and I 'll rip your head off . - Ref , did you hear that ? I 'm not worried . He said it to you , not me . Let 's go , sonny . - What 's he doing ? - You 're the skipper , you tell him . Bollocks . Hold on . Fucker ! It 's kicked off . Let 's just try and keep calm . - Referee ! - Go on , get in there . Go on , chin him ! This is n't a football match ! - Do him ! - Go on , do him ! - This is bollocks ! - Do him ! Who are you hitting ? This is bollocks ! What 's going on here ? - You want some ? Come on . - Any day . Where are you , referee ? - Excuse me . Sorry . - Calm down , everybody
zone2	- Bollocks , that 'll do . Half-time , come on . One-nil to the Mean Machine , one-nil ... What the hell do you think you 're doing ? You 're supposed to throw this game . Yeah , they do n't seem to be taking notice of me . Youthful exuberance . Shame . It would have worked out nice . What do you think Danny will say in the dressing room ? I think he 'll be saying there 's only 45 minutes left to play . Yeah . Settle down , boys . Have a listen . We ai n't won nothing yet . All we 've got is one goal . Now this half is when we 're gon na earn it . Midfield , tuck in , get round behind the ball . Monk ? Good work , Monk , just do n't leave us exposed at the back , all right ? - Mouse ? - lt 's my nose . - Bill , you come on for Mouse . - Where am I playing ? You take his place in midfield .
zone2	, we 've botched it , but we 're one-nil down . Mr Hayter , when the ... You think about it ! We 're getting beaten by a bunch of worthless criminals . - l 'm doing my half-time talk , sir . - Sit down . Have you forgotten who they are ? They 're the dregs of society , and they 're in the next dressing room . And they 're laughing at you right now . Just remember this : every man here is playing for his job . including you . - You wanted to see me ? - Yes . - What 's going on ? - You wanted a game . Yes , but you never said anything about winning . You never said nothing about losing either . Before leaving us , Nitro wrote a confession . He admitted killing Doc . He said you knew about it , and you sent Doc to your cell . Now that 's accessory to murder , and that 's 20 years . You 'll never get that to stick . One whiff of this
zone2	be with us for some time . So I think it 's in everyone 's interest if you lose this game . - l ca n't do that . - You 've done it before . You had everything they ever dreamed of , and you threw it all away . Meehan has given it away again . For fuck 's sake , Danny , I was open . I did n't see you . Looks like he 's in a world of his own . Wake up , Meehan . The ball 's played out to the left . Hibert picks it up and moves forward to the 1 8-yard box . The defender cuts inside . He plays it to Hayter , who knocks it through for Downes . Oh no , he 's been brought down in the area . Could be a penalty . The ref 's waved play on . What goes through Monk 's head ? - Scary thought . - l 'd hate to think what he dreams about . It 's getting naughty out there . Positively brutal . Are they fighting
zone2	fighting , Bob . Billy 's chasing the ball like a terrier . Shame he has n't got the skill to match his enthusiasm . - Shame he 's fucking useless , Bob . - Abso-fucking-lutely , Bob . Ratchett 's taken out Cigs . Looks like the guards are n't taking any prisoners . You get it ? Whatever , Bob . You , fuckin ' watch it . No , you fuckin ' watch it , you fat bastard Indian ! That 's going a bit too far , in n it ? - He took a dive ! - Number 7 , violent conduct . Off the park . It was a dive , look ! - Come on . Do one , now . - Fuck off ! The cons are down to ten men . It 's an early bath for Raj , which is really gon na put pressure on the Mean Machine . It 's disappointing . It 's not gon na be easy out there . That 's right . And they 're taking full advantage of the extra man on the
zone2	who plays it , and Hayter , and Monk ... Superb save , way down to his left . All right ! 29 minutes , still one-nil , and the cons are holding out . And the Monk 's going on another walk-about . But this time he plays it safe to Trojan out wide . - All Troj has to do is look up . - And pass it . - Pass it . - Pass it . - Pass it . - Pass it . Pass the fucking ball ! Yes ! Goal ! Two-nil for the cons , ten men down , their liberty taken away from them , locked in a cell for 23 hours a day . and today , our boys had their day . What 's up with you ? For the last hour of my life , I have been free ! Mean Machine ! Mean Machine ! Mean Machine ! Mean Machine ! Yes ! It 's the guards to kick off . Mr Williams lays it back for Mr Hibert , who whips a beautiful ball into the box .
zone2	- You 've got ta love the Monk . - Got ta love the Monk . What 's Monk doing ? He 's left an empty net ! He 's lost the fuckin ' ball ! He 's lost the fuckin ' plot . Guards ' goal . Two-one . Yes ! Hey ! Stop fucking about back here ! Get the ball up the park ! All right . My fault . It 's no longer just a game out there . There 's a match on now . - Have a word , Dan . - Fuck off , Trojan . - Come on , let 's go . - Come on , boys . The cons kick off . But what is he doing ? He 's given it straight away . He 's hit the bar . You see , there 's no cohesion , there 's no character . The Mean Machine need their star player to pick up his game now . - What is Meehan doing anyway ? - lt 's like he 's not even on the pitch . What 's up
zone2	Danny 's injured . You 're cheating now . Once a loser , always a loser . - Dan , where did you get hit ? - Down there . Does n't look too clever , boys . - l ca n't see anything . - Let 's get him up . Come on . Do n't put no weight on it , Dan . Meehan 's leaving the pitch . Let 's hope they bring a sub on . - lt 's 1 1 against 9 out there . - All right , got it . - Get it fixed . - OK , we got it . Shove up and shut up . The guards are moving the ball nicely . Neat passing . But the cons are determined not to give up . There 's nothing wrong with that leg , is there ? - Why do n't people just let me play ? - Did n't think you 'd sell us out . Not after the big " it 's your time " speech . - ls there something I should know ? - He 's
zone2	's getting tough . The guards are putting the pressure on . Fuckin ' hell , Massive , help us out . We 've only got nine men on ! Get a sub on . Walker to Marsden . Downs , wide to Hibert . Hibert clips it forward . Walker brings it down . The cons are swamped at the back . Ratchett 's free in the area . Oh , no ! Yes ! Yes ! - Two-fucking-two . - Good one ! Good one ! Thanks , Danny Meehan . Two-two . Right , now a third . Get up there ! Ref . Sub . - Mass , look ... - lt 's your life . Ratchett 's brought down Billy the Limpet . And that 's like kicking a puppy dog . Give me my boot . Yes ! Ref ! Ref ! I 'm coming back on . - Sit down . - Forget it , Meehan . Who 's coming on ? - Me . - Him . - l am . - You 're playing like crap and you know it .
zone2	go . - l 'm in charge . Danny 's coming on . - Hold it ! - Listen , I 'm the owner . - You ? - Yes . - The owner ? - Yes . - Behave . Manager 's decision . You , on . The great Meehan returns to the pitch . Yeah , that 's all we need . lf he carries on playing like he did before he went off , we may as well all go home now , Bob . Ketch knocks it out wide to Trojan . It 's amazing . The guards still find it hard to deal with this man . I 'm with you here if you want . Shoot ! Shoot ! Pass it , I 'm on ! Pass it here ! Trojan plays it into the centre . I 'm free there ! - Well , I did n't see you , did I ? - Really ? Chiv , pass it ! Chiv , pass it ! Oh , God . That was a meeting of minds . Not a pretty sight .
zone2	he 's gon na have to do a lot of work to manage that . Meehan is now everywhere . He is bobbing and weaving , Bob . No way was that offside . That 's the way it 's done , pal . The ball 's pushed high into the guards ' half . Cigs pulls it down . Shoots . What a goal ! - The Mean Machine are in front again . - There 's a flag . - God bless the Mean Machine . - Keep your shirt on . - Wait a minute ... - There 's something going on . - They 're still celebrating . - lt 's been disallowed . The ref has gone to the linesman . There 's confusion on the pitch . - There certainly is . - They 're conferring . Surely not ! Now , if this stands , it 's a free kick to the guards , - 35 yards out from the goal . - Get up , you bloody tart . OK , let 's get him off . It 's in a goal
zone2	're in the dying seconds of the game . lt 's two-two . Lee , get changed . You 're on , mate . Ref ! Mr Ratchett , are you all right , sir ? Obviously not . All right , take him away . - Are you gon na do nothing about that ? - lt 's a free kick , now take it . - How long ? - Just moving into injury time . This is it . lf he scores now , it 's all over . All right , stick it in . Prison warder Mr Gayle , will take it . He curls it . It 's heading to the top right-hand corner . No ! Yeah ! Guards of Pentonville , guards of Wandsworth ... - ... Walton nick in Liverpool ... - ... policemen of Britain ... traffic wardens and parole officers , wheel clampers , your boys have taken a hell of a beating today . A hell of a beating . Mean Machine ! Mean Machine , Mean Machine ... Mean Machine , Mean Machine ... Burnin ' me
zone2	down , Danny , all down there . - You 're all right , Dan . - Take that . - l told you I would n't let you down . - Well done ! Ruin my life , I 'm gon na fucking ruin your life . No . You 're not stitching anyone up . Not on my watch . What are you gon na do about it ? Your job , your pension ... My arse . Good game . Jesus , what was that ? Looks like your Saab . And what he said goes for me and all , and Barry the Bookie too . Nice one , Danny ! I want him in solitary , and I 'm the governor , and that 's an order . OK ? Shut up ! Stick that in your trophy cabinet .

Loads of old stuff like mummies , tombs , even Scabbers enjoyed himself . - Egyptians used to worship cats . - Along with the dung beetle . - Not flashing that clipping again ? - I have n't shown anyone . No , not a soul . Not unless you count Tom . - The day maid . - Night maid . - Cook . - The bloke who fixed the toilet . - Harry . - Mrs . Weasley . - Good to see you , dear . - Good to see you . - Got everything ? - Yes . - Yes ? All your books ? - It 's all upstairs . - Your clothes ? - Everything . - Good boy . - Thank you . - Harry
zone2	wonder if I might have a word ? - Yeah , sure . - Hermione . - Good morning , Mr . Weasley . - Looking forward to a new term ? - Yeah . It should be great . Harry , some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I 'm about to reveal to you . But I think that you need to know the facts . You are in danger . Grave danger . Has this anything to do with Sirius Black , sir ? What do you know about Sirius Black , Harry ? - Only that he 's escaped from Azkaban . - Do you know why ? Thirteen years ago , when you stopped ... - Voldemort . - Do n't say his name . Sorry . When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything . But to this day , he still remains a faithful servant . And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power . And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban . To find you .
zone2	whatever you might hear you wo n't go looking for Black . Mr . Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me ? Quick . Quick . Ron , Ron ! Oh , for goodness ' sake ! Do n't lose him ! I did n't mean to blow her up . I just ... - I lost control . - Brilliant . Honestly , Ron , it 's not funny . Harry was lucky not to be expelled . I was lucky not to be arrested . I still think it was brilliant . Come on . Everywhere else is full . Who do you think that is ? - Professor R.J . Lupin . - Do you know everything ? How is it she knows everything ? - It 's on his suitcase , Ronald . - Oh . - Do you think he 's really asleep ? - Seems to be . Why ? I got ta tell you something . Let me get this straight . Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you ? - Yeah . But they
zone2	mean , everyone 's looking for him . - Sure . Except no one 's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he 's a murderous , raving lunatic . - Thanks , Ron . Why are we stopping ? We ca n't be there yet . What 's going on ? I do n't know . Maybe we 've broken down . Ouch , Ron . That was my foot . There 's something moving out there . I think someone 's coming aboard . Bloody hell ! What 's happening ? Harry . Harry , are you all right ? Thank you . Here , eat this . It 'll help . It 's all right . It 's chocolate . What was that thing that came ? It was a dementor . One of the guards of Azkaban . It 's gone now . It was searching the train for Sirius Black . If you 'll excuse me , I need to have a little word with the driver . Eat . You 'll feel better . What happened to me ? Well , you sort of
zone2	fit or something . And did either of you two you know pass out ? - No . I felt weird , though . Like I 'd never be cheerful again . But someone was screaming . A woman . No one was screaming , Harry . Welcome ! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts . Now , I 'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast . First , I 'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J . Lupin who 's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher . Good luck , professor . Of course . That 's why he knew to give you the chocolate , Harry . Potter . Is it true you fainted ? - I mean , you actually fainted ? - Shove off , Malfoy . - How did he find out ? - Just forget it . Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs . Fortunately , I 'm delighted to announce that his place
zone2	Hagrid . Finally , on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic Hogwarts will , until further notice , play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured . The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds . Now whilst I 've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution . Dementors are vicious creatures . They 'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way . Therefore , I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you . It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving . But you know , happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light . Fortuna Major . Here , listen . She just wo n't let me in . - Fortuna Major . - No , no . Wait , wait . Watch this . - Amazing . Just with my
zone2	right . Go in . - Thank you . Still doing that after three years . - She ca n't even sing . - Exactly . - Hey , man . - Hey , man . - Oh , God . - That 's awful . Green . That 's a monkey . - What is that ? - You call that a monkey ? Do not give him one again . Hey , Neville , try an elephant . - Ron , catch . - I will . I think we have a winner . - Oh , do n't try one of them . - Oh , no . Look at him . His face . Welcome , my children . In this room , you shall explore the noble art of Divination . In this room , you shall discover if you possess the Sight . Hello . I am Professor Trelawney . Together we shall cast ourselves into the future . This term , we 'll focus on Tasseomancy , the art of reading tea leaves . So please , take the cup of the person
zone2	truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book , waiting to be read . But first , you must broaden your minds . - First , you must look beyond . - What a load of rubbish . - Where did you come from ? - Me ? - I 've been here all this time . - You , boy ... Is your grandmother quite well ? I think so . I would n't be so sure of that . Give me the cup . Pity . Broaden your minds . Your aura is pulsing , dear . Are you in the beyond ? - I think you are . - Sure . Look at the cup . Tell me what you see . Yeah . Harry 's got sort of a wonky cross . That 's trials and suffering . And that there could be the sun and that 's happiness . So you 're gon na suffer , but you 're gon na be happy about it . Give me the cup . Oh , my dear boy . My dear you have the Grim
zone2	the Grin , you idiot . The Grim . " Taking form of a giant spectral dog . It 's among the darkest omens in our world . It 's an omen of death . " You do n't think that Grim thing 's got anything to do with Sirius Black ? Oh , honestly , Ron . If you ask me , Divination 's a woolly discipline . Now , Ancient Runes , that 's a fascinating subject . Ancient Runes ? Exactly how many classes are you taking ? A fair few . Hang on . That 's not possible . Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination . You have to be in two classes at once . Do n't be silly . How could anyone be in two classes at once ? " Broaden your minds . Use your Inner Eye to see the future . " That 's it . Come on , now . Come closer . Less talking , if you do n't mind . I got a real treat for you today . A great lesson . So follow me
zone2	a group over there . And open your books to page 49 . Exactly how do we do that ? Just stroke the spine , of course . Goodness me . - Do n't be such a wimp , Longbottom . - I 'm okay . Okay . - I think they 're funny . - Oh , yeah . Terribly funny . Witty . God , this place has gone to the dogs . Wait until Father hears Dumbledore 's got this oaf teaching classes . Shut up , Malfoy . Dementor ! Dementor ! - Just ignore him . - You 're supposed to stroke it . Yeah . Is n't he beautiful ? Say hello to Buckbeak . Hagrid , exactly what is that ? That , Ron , is a hippogriff . First thing you wan na know is they 're very proud creatures . Very easily offended . You do not want to insult a hippogriff . It may be the last thing you ever do . Now , who 'd like to come and say hello ? Well done , Harry . Well done
zone2	him make the first move . It 's only polite . So step up . Give him a nice bow . Then you wait and see if he bows back . If he does , you can go and touch him . If not ... Well , we 'll get to that later . Just make your bow . Nice and low . Back off , Harry . Back off . Keep still . Keep still . Well done , Harry . Well done . Here , you big brute , you . Right . I think you can go and pat him now . Go on . Do n't be shy . Nice and slow , now . Nice and slow . Slow . Not so fast , Harry . Slow down , Harry . That 's it ... Nice and slow . Now let him come to you . Slowly , now , slowly , slowly ... That 's it ... Yes ! Well done ! Well done , Harry , well done ! Does he get to fly ? - I think he may let you ride
zone2	- Hey , hey , hey ! Put you over here , just behind the wing joint . Do n't pull out any of his feathers , because he wo n't thank you for that . Well done , Harry , and well done , Buckbeak . That was wicked , Harry ! Oh , please . Well done , well done . - How am I doing me first day ? - Brilliant , professor . You 're not dangerous at all , are you , you great ugly brute ! Malfoy , no ... No ! Buckbeak ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ... Whoa ! Buckbeak ! Away , you silly creature ... - It 's killed me ! - Calm down . It 's just a scratch ! Hagrid ! - He has to be taken to the hospital . - I 'm the teacher . I 'll do it . - You 're gon na regret this . - Class dismissed ! You and your bloody chicken ! Does it hurt terribly , Draco ? It comes and it goes . Still , I consider
zone2	could 've lost my arm . - I ca n't do homework for weeks . - Listen to the idiot . - He 's really laying it on thick , is n't he ? - At least Hagrid did n't get fired . I hear Draco 's father 's furious . We have n't heard the end of this . - He 's been sighted ! - Who ? Sirius Black ! Dufftown ? That 's not far from here . You do n't think he 'd come to Hogwarts , do you ? - With dementors at every entrance ? - Dementors ? He slipped past them once . Who 's to say he wo n't do it again ? That 's right . Black could be anywhere . It 's like trying to catch smoke . Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands . Intriguing , is n't it ? Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside ? - That 's a boggart , that is . - Very good , Mr . Thomas . Now , can anybody tell me
zone2	. - When did she get here ? Boggarts are shape-shifters . They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most . - That 's what makes them so ... - So terrifying , yes , yes , yes ... Luckily , a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart . Let 's practice it now . Without wands , please . After me . Riddikulus ! - Riddikulus ! - Very good . A little louder and very clear . - Riddikulus ! - Riddikulus ! - This class is ridiculous . - Very good . So much for the easy part . You see , the incantation alone is not enough . What really finishes a boggart is laughter . You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing . Let me explain . Neville , would you join me , please ? Come on , do n't be shy . Come on . Come on . Hello . Neville , what frightens you most of all ? Professor Snape . - Sorry ? - Professor Snape . Professor Snape .
zone2	grandmother . - I do n't want it to turn into her , either . No it wo n't . I want you to picture her clothes . Only her clothes , very clearly , in your mind . - She carries a red handbag ... - We do n't need to hear . As long as you see it , we 'll see it . Now , when I open that wardrobe here 's what I want you to do . Excuse me . Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother 's clothes . Can you do that ? Yes . Wand at the ready . One , two , three . Think , Neville , think . Riddikulus ! Wonderful , Neville , wonderful ! Incredible ! Okay to the back , Neville . Everyone , form a line ... Form a line ! I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny . Next ! Ron ! Concentrate . Face your fear . Be brave ! Wand at the ready , Ron . Riddikulus ! Yes ! You see
zone2	, very , very enjoyable ! Parvati ! Next ! Show us what you see . Keep your nerve . Steady . Riddikulus ! And next ! Step up , step up ! Wonderful , wonderful ! Here ! Riddikulus ! Right . Sorry about that . That 's enough for today . Collect your books from the back . That 's the end of the lesson . Thank you ! Sorry ! Sorry , you can have too much of a good thing . Remember , these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege . Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again . No permission form signed , no visiting the village . That 's the rule , Potter . Those with permission , follow me . Those without , stay put . I thought if you signed it , then I could ... I ca n't . Only a parent or a guardian can sign . Since I am neither , it would be inappropriate . I 'm sorry , Potter . That 's my final word . Forget about
zone2	can I ask you something ? You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart , yes ? I thought it 'd be obvious . I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort . I did think of Voldemort at first . But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor . - I 'm very impressed . That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself . This is very wise . Before I fainted I heard something . A woman screaming . Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories . Our pain becomes their power . I think it was my mother the night she was murdered . The very first time I saw you , Harry , I recognized you immediately . Not by your scar , by your eyes . They 're your mother , Lily 's . Yes . Oh , yes . I knew her . Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was . Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly
zone2	beauty in others even , and most especially , when that person could not see it in themselves . And your father , James , on the other hand he ... He had a certain , shall we say , talent for trouble . A talent , rumor has it , he passed on to you . You 're more like them than you know , Harry . In time , you 'll come to see just how much . Honeyduke 's Sweetshop is brilliant , but nothing beats Zonko 's Joke Shop . We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack . - You heard it 's the most ... - Haunted building in Britain . I know . What 's going on ? Probably Neville forgot the password again . - Hey . - Oh , you 're there . Let me through , please . Excuse me ! I 'm Head Boy ! Get back , all of you . No one is to enter this dormitory until it 's been searched . The Fat Lady ! She 's gone ! Serves her right . She
zone2	Ron . Keep calm , everyone . Break into fours . Back to your common room . - Be quiet . - Make way . - The headmaster 's here . - Come on , move . You heard . Move ! Mr . Filch ? Round up the ghosts . Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady . There 's no need for ghosts , professor . The Fat Lady 's there . Mind where you 're going ! Slow down ! You listen ! I 'm Head Boy ! - Come back here ! - Keep moving ! Dear lady , who did this to you ? Eyes like the devil , he 's got , and a soul as dark as his name . It 's him , headmaster . The one they all talk about . He 's here , somewhere in the castle ! Sirius Black ! Secure the castle , Mr . Filch . The rest of you , to the Great Hall . I 've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery . There 's nothing
zone2	's clear too , sir . - Very good . - I 've done the dungeons . No sign of Black , nor anywhere else in the castle . I did n't really expect him to linger . Remarkable feat , do n't you think ? To enter Hogwarts Castle on one 's own ... Any theories on how he managed it ? Many . Each as unlikely as the next . You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor ... Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it . I 'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I 'm more than willing to send the students to their houses . What about Potter ? Should he be warned ? Perhaps . But for now , let him sleep . For in dreams , we enter a world that 's entirely our own . Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud . Turn to page 394 . Excuse me , sir . Where 's Professor Lupin ? That 's
zone2	Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time . Turn to page 394 . " Werewolves " ? Sir , we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks . - We 're not meant to start that for weeks . - Quiet . When did she come in ? Did you see her come in ? Now , which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf ? No one ? - How disappointing . - Please , sir . An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal . A werewolf has no choice . With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is . He 'd kill his best friend . The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind . Thank you , Mr . Malfoy . That 's the second time you 've spoken out of turn , Miss Granger . Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all ? - He 's got a point , you
zone2	antidote to your ignorance , and on my desk , by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf , with emphasis on recognizing it . - It 's Quidditch tomorrow . Then I suggest you take extra care , Mr . Potter . Loss of limb will not excuse you . Page 394 . The term " werewolf " is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word " wer " which means " man , " and " wolf . " Werewolf , man-wolf . There are several ways to become a werewolf . They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf ... Go , Harry ! Go , Harry ! Aresto momentum ! - He looks a bit peaky , does n't he ? - Peaky ? What do you expect ? He fell over 100 feet . Let 's walk you off a tower and see what you look like . Probably a right sight better than he normally does . - How are you feeling ? - Oh , brilliant . You gave us a right good scare . - What
zone2	. Really ? I meant the match . Who won ? No one blames you , Harry . Dementors are n't supposed to be on the grounds . Dumbledore 's furious . After he saved you , he sent them off . There 's something else you should know too . When you fell , your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow , and ... Well ... I 'm sorry to hear about your broomstick . Is there no chance of fixing it ? No . Professor , why do the dementors affect me so ? - I mean , more than everyone else ? - Listen . Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth . They feed on every good feeling , every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences . You are not weak , Harry . Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past . Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine . You have nothing to be ashamed of . - I 'm scared , professor . - I 'd consider you
zone2	know how to fight them . You could teach me . You made the one on the train go away . There was only one that night . - But you made it go away . - I do n't pretend to be an expert , Harry . But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you . But after the holidays . For now , I need to rest . Last call for Hogsmeade ! Come on , now ! - Guys , let me go . - Clever , Harry . - But not clever enough . - We 've got a better way . - I 'm trying to get to Hogsmeade . - We know . We 'll get you there . - We 'll show you a quicker way . - lf you pipe down . - Bless him . - Let me go ! Come on , guys . Do n't ... - Now , Harry . - Come and join the big boys . What are you doing ? ! - What 's this rubbish
zone2	says . - It 's the secret to our success . - It 's a wrench giving it to you ... But we 've decided your needs are greater than ours . George , if you will . I solemnly swear that I am up to no good . " Messrs . Moony , Wormtail , Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder 's Map . " We owe them so much . Hang on . This is Hogwarts . And that ... - No . Is that really ... ? - Dumbledore . - In his study . - Pacing . Does that a lot . - So this map shows ... ? - Everyone . - Where they are . - What they 're doing . - Every minute . - Every day . - Brilliant ! Where did you get it ? - From Filch 's office . - First year . - There are seven secret passageways out of the castle . - We 'd recommend this one . - The One-Eyed Witch passageway . - Leads you to Honeyduke 's . Hurry .
zone2	. When you 're done , " Mischief managed . " Otherwise , anyone can read it . Now , how much do you want ? Delicious . It 's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain . Did I mention that ? Twice . Do you want to move a bit closer ? To the Shrieking Shack ? Actually , I 'm fine here . Well , well . Look who 's here . You two shopping for your new dream home ? Bit grand for you , is n't it , Weasle-Bee ? Do n't your family sleep in one room ? - Shut your mouth , Malfoy . - Not very friendly . Boys , I think it 's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors . - Hope you do n't mean yourself . - How dare you talk to me ! You filthy little mudblood ! Who is that ? - Do n't stand there ! Do something ! - What ? What 's up , Malfoy ? Lost your skis ? Get out of the way ! Move ! Malfoy
zone2	Harry . That was not funny . Those weasels ! Never told me about any Marauder 's Map . He wo n't keep it . He 'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall . - Are n't you ? - Sure . Along with his Invisibility Cloak . Look who it is . Madam Rosmerta . - Ron fancies her . - That 's not true ! - Professor McGonagall ! - Cornelius ! Allow me , minister . - Oh , Hagrid ... - Sorry about that . Rosmerta , my dear . I hope business is good . It 'd be a lot better if the Ministry was n't sending dementors into my pub every other night ! - We have ... - We have a killer on the loose . - Sirius Black in Hogsmeade ! And what would bring him here ? - Harry Potter . - Harry Potter ? Come . Harry ! - No underage wizards allowed in today ! - Shut the damn door ! - So rude . - Thick heads . - Thick heads ? ! - How dare they !
zone2	whippersnappers ! Nobody will come to a pub where they 'll get scared out of their wits . Professor Dumbledore does n't want dementors around the place . Tell me what this is all about . Years ago , when Harry Potter 's parents realized they were marked for death ... Remember ? They hid . Few knew where they were . One who did was Sirius Black . And he told You-Know-Who . Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night he also killed Peter Pettigrew ! - Peter Pettigrew ? - Little lump of a boy . - Always trailing after Black . - I remember . Never let James and Sirius out of his sight . - What happened ? - Peter tried to warn the Potters and might have , had he not run into an old friend , Sirius Black . Black was vicious . He did n't kill Pettigrew . He destroyed him ! A finger . That 's all that was left . A finger . Nothing else . Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters
zone2	He wants to finish things . - I do n't believe it . - That 's not the worst of it . - What could be worse ? - This : Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter 's godfather ! Ron , look ! - Sorry . Excuse me , excuse me . - Merry Christmas . Harry , what happened ? He was their friend and he betrayed them . He was their friend ! I hope he finds me . Because when he does , I 'm gon na be ready ! When he does , I 'm gon na kill him ! Harry . There you are . You came . Are you sure about this , Harry ? This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level . I 'm sure . Well , everything 's prepared . The spell I 'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm . Did you ever hear of it ? No ? Well ... A Patronus is a positive force . For the wizard who conjures one it works like a
zone2	him . But in order for it to work , you need to think of a memory . Not just any memory , a very happy memory , a very powerful memory . Can you do this ? Yes . Very well . Close your eyes . Concentrate . Explore your past . Do you have a memory ? Allow it to fill you up . Lose yourself within it . Then speak the incantation , Expecto Patronum . - Expecto Patronum . - Very good . Shall we ? Wand at the ready . Expecto Patronum ! Expecto ... Expecto ... Expect ... Here we go . Come on . Sit up . Deep breaths . It 's all right . I did n't expect you to do it the first time . That would have been remarkable . Here , eat this . You 'll feel better . - That 's one nasty dementor . - Oh , no , no , no . That was a boggart , Harry . A boggart . The real thing would be worse . Much , much worse . As a
zone2	Which memory did you choose ? - The first time I rode a broom . That 's not good enough . Not nearly good enough . There 's another . It 's not happy , exactly . Well , it is . It 's the happiest I 've ever felt but it 's complicated . - Is it strong ? Then let 's give it a try . You feel ready ? Just do it . Expecto Patronum ! Expecto Patronum ! Yes ! Well done , Harry . Well done ! - I think I 've had enough for today . - Yes . Sit down . Here . Eat this , it helps . It really helps . And just so you know , Harry I think you 'd have given your father a run for his money . And that is saying something . I was thinking of him . And Mum . Seeing their faces . They were talking to me . Just talking . That 's the memory I chose . I do n't even know if it 's real . But it 's the
zone2	. Unless you 've been ripped to pieces ! Ripped to pieces ? What are you talking about ? - Ronald has lost his rat . - I have n't lost anything ! - Your cat killed him ! - Rubbish . Harry , you 've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about . And Scabbers is gone . Well , maybe you should take better care of your pets ! - Your cat killed him ! - Did not . - Did . - Did n't . How did it go , Hagrid ? The hearing ? Well , first off , the committee members took turns talking about why we were there . I got up and did my piece . Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff , always cleaned his feathers . And then Lucius Malfoy got up . Well , you can imagine . He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you . And then ? And then he asked for the worst , did old Lucius . -
zone2	'm not sacked . Buckbeak 's been sentenced to death ! Spiders ! There 's ... There 's spiders . Spiders . They want me to tap-dance . - I do n't wan na tap-dance ! - You tell those spiders . Right , yeah . Tell them . I 'll tell them ... - Peter Pettigrew ? - Little lump of a boy . - Always trailing after Sirius Black . - Black was vicious . He did n't kill Pettigrew , he destroyed him ! - Put that light out ! - Sorry . - Watch it there , boy . - We 're trying to sleep here ! Mischief managed . Nox . Potter . What are you doing wandering the corridors at night ? I was sleepwalking . How extraordinarily like your father you are , Potter . He , too , was exceedingly arrogant , strutting about the castle . My dad did n't strut . And nor do I . Now , if you do n't mind , I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand . Turn out your pockets .
zone2	Spare bit of parchment . - Really ? Open it . Reveal your secrets . Read it . " Messrs . Moony , Wormtail , Padfoot , and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and ... " Go on . " And request he keep his large nose out of other people 's business . " - You insolent little ... - Professor ! Well , well . Lupin . Out for a little walk in the moonlight , are we ? Harry , are you all right ? That remains to be seen . I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact . Take a look , Lupin . Supposed to be your area of expertise . - Clearly , it 's full of dark magic . - I seriously doubt it , Severus . It looks as though it 's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it . I suspect it 's a Zonko product . Nevertheless , I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess . It is , after all , as you say , my area of expertise
zone2	? Professor , good night . Are you deaf ? Put that light out ! Come in . I have n't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly , I am astounded that you did n't hand it in . Did it never occur to you that this , in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you ? - No . - No , sir . Your father never set much store by the rules either . But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours . Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them ! Now , I will not cover up for you again . - Do you hear me ? - Yes , sir . I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there . And do n't take any detours . If you do , I shall know . Professor , just so you know , I do n't think that map always works . Earlier
zone2	know to be dead . Oh , really ? And who might that be ? Peter Pettigrew . That 's not possible . It 's just what I saw . Good night , professor . Broaden your minds . You must look beyond . The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye . Only then can you see . Try again . Now , what do we have here ? Do you mind me trying ? The Grim , possibly . My dear , from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination . No , you see , there . You may be young in years , but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid 's , your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave . Have I said something ? She 's gone mental , Hermione has . Not that she was n't always mental but now it 's in the open for everyone to see
zone2	. - I 'm not going back . - Fine . See you later . - See you . Harry Potter ... - Professor Trelawney ... - He will return tonight . Sorry ? Tonight , he who betrayed his friends , whose heart rots with murder shall break free . Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more . I 'm so sorry , dear boy . Did you say something ? No . Nothing . I ca n't believe they 're going to kill Buckbeak . It 's just too horrible . - It just got worse . - What did I say ? Father said I can keep the hippogriff 's head . I 'll donate it to the Gryffindors ' room . This is going to be rich . - Look who 's here . - Come to see the show ? You ! You foul , loathsome , evil little cockroach ! Hermione , no ! He 's not worth it . Malfoy , are you okay ? - Let 's go . Quick . - Not a word
zone2	- Not good , brilliant . Look at him . Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them . Why do n't we just set him free ? They 'd know it was me , and then Dumbledore would get into trouble . He 's coming down , Dumbledore . Says he wants to be with me when they ... When it happens . Great man , Dumbledore . A great man . - We 'll stay with you too . - You 'll do no such thing ! Think I want you seeing something like that ? No . You just drink your tea and be off . Oh . Before you do , Ron ... Scabbers ! You 're alive ! - Keep a closer eye on your pet . - I think you owe someone an apology . Right . Next time I see Crookshanks , I 'll let him know . I meant me ! Blimey . What was that ? Hagrid ! Oh , crikey . No , minister . Over this way . It 's late . It 's nearly
zone2	you outside this time of night , you 'll be in trouble . Particularly you , Harry . With you in a moment ! Quick . Quick ! Hagrid . - It 'll be fine . It 'll be okay . - Go on , go on ! - That 's ling you see over there ... - On the slope . - On the slope ... Ah , Hagrid . - Professor Dumbledore . - Good evening . - Minister . Make your way through . - Have a tea , if you like . - No , Hagrid . - Gentlemen . - I 'd like a cup of tea . Well , I think we should get down to our business , shall we ? Very well . It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak hereinafter called " the condemned , " shall be executed this day at sundown . - Dear , dear ... - Now , now , Hagrid . Now , come on . - All right . It 'll be all right .
zone2	I just saw ... - Never mind . - Let 's go ! Buckbeak did n't mean no harm . Oh , no . He bit me . Scabbers . Ron . Ron ! - Ron ! - Scabbers , come back . Wait ! - Scabbers , you bit me ! - Harry , you do realize what tree this is ? That 's not good . Ron , run ! Harry , Hermione , run ! It 's the Grim ! - Harry ! - Ron ! Ron , wait ! Harry ! - Help ! - Ron ! - Ron . Ron . - Ron ! Come on ! Move ! Duck ! Harry ! - Oh , I 'm sorry . - Do n't worry . - Where do you suppose this goes ? - I have a hunch . I just hope I 'm wrong . We 're in the Shrieking Shack , are n't we ? Come on . Ron . - Ron . You 're okay . - The dog . Where is it ? It 's a trap . He 's the
zone2	to kill Harry , you have to kill us too ! No . Only one will die tonight . Then it 'll be you ! Are you going to kill me , Harry ? Expelliarmus ! Well , well , Sirius . Looking rather ragged , are n't we ? Finally , the flesh reflects the madness within . Well , you 'd know all about the madness within , would n't you ? - I found him . - I know . - He 's here . - I understand . - Let 's kill him ! - No ! I trusted you ! And all this time , you 've been his friend . He 's a werewolf ! That 's why he 's been missing classes . How long have you known ? - Since Professor Snape set the essay . - Well , Hermione . You are the brightest witch of your age I 've ever met . Enough talk , Remus ! Come on , let 's kill him ! - Wait ! - I did my waiting ! Twelve years of it ! In
zone2	one more minute . Harry has the right to know why . I know why . You betrayed my parents . - You 're the reason they 're dead ! - No , it was n't him . Somebody did betray your parents somebody who , until quite recently , I believed to be dead ! - Who was it , then ? - Peter Pettigrew ! And he 's in this room ! Right now ! Come out , come out , Peter ! - Come out , come out and play ! - Expelliarmus ! Vengeance is sweet . How I hoped I 'd be the one to catch you . Severus ... I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle . Here 's the proof . Brilliant , Snape . You put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion . If you 'll excuse us , Remus and I have business to attend to . - Give me a reason . I beg you ! - Do n't be a fool . - He ca n't help it .
zone2	quiet yourself ! You two , quarrelling like an old married couple . Run along and play with your chemistry set ! I could do it , you know . But why deny the dementors ? They 're so longing to see you . Do I detect a flicker of fear ? Oh , yes . A Dementor 's Kiss . One can only imagine what that must be like . It 's said to be nearly unbearable to witness , but I 'll do my best . Severus , please . After you . Expelliarmus ! - Harry ! What did you just do ? - You attacked a teacher ! - Tell me about Peter . - He was at school with us . We thought he was our friend ! - No . Pettigrew 's dead . You killed him ! - No , he did n't . I thought so too , until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map ! - The map was lying , then . - The map never lies ! Pettigrew 's alive ! And he 's right there ! - Me
zone2	Your rat ! - Scabbers has been in my family for ... - Twelve years ? Curiously long life for a common garden rat ! - He 's missing a toe , is n't he ? - So what ? - All they could find of Pettigrew was his ... - Finger ! Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead ! - And then he transformed into a rat ! - Show me . - Give it to him , Ron . - What are you trying to do to him ? Scabbers ! Leave him alone ! Get off him ! What are you doing ? Remus ? Sirius . My old friends ! Harry ! Look at you . You look so much like your father . - James . We were the best of friends ... - How dare you speak to Harry ! How dare you talk about James in front of him ! - You sold James and Lily to Voldemort ! - I did n't mean to ! The Dark Lord . You have no idea the weapons he
zone2	have done ? - What would you have done ? - Died , rather than betray my friends ! James would n't have wanted me killed ! Your dad would have spared me ! He would have shown me mercy ! Should have realized if Voldemort did n't kill you , we would . Together ! No ! - Harry , this man ... - I know what he is . But we 'll take him to the castle . - Bless you , boy . Bless you ! - Get off ! I said we 'd take you to the castle . After that , the dementors can have you . Sorry about the bite . I reckon that twinges a bit . A bit ? A bit ? You almost tore my leg off ! I was going for the rat . Normally , I have a very sweet disposition as a dog . More than once , James suggested that I make the change permanent . The tail I could live with . But the fleas , they 're murder . Okay . - You better go
zone2	It 's fine . I 'll stay . You go , I 'll stay . - You okay ? - I 'm fine . Go . - That looks really painful . - So painful . They might chop it . I 'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat . It 's too late . It 's ruined . It 'll have to be chopped off . It 's beautiful , is n't it ? I 'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors . It 'll be nice to do it again as a free man . That was a noble thing you did back there . He does n't deserve it . I did n't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers . Besides , dead , the truth dies with him . Alive , you 're free . Turn me into a flobberworm . Anything but the dementors ! Ron ! Have n't I been a good pet ? You wo n't let them give me to the dementors , will you ? I was your
zone2	wo n't ... - Get away from her ! I do n't know if you know , Harry but when you were born , James and Lily made me your godfather . I know . I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home ... What ? Come and live with you ? It 's just a thought . I can understand if you do n't want to . Harry ! Remus , my old friend . Have you taken your potion tonight ? You know the man you truly are , Remus ! This heart is where you truly live ! Here ! This flesh is only flesh ! Expelliarmus ! Harry ! Remus ! Remus ! Run ! Run ! - Come on . - Wait . Wait . Hermione ! Bad idea . Bad idea . Professor ? Professor Lupin ? Nice doggy . Nice doggy ! There you are , Potter ! Sirius ! Come back here , Potter ! Sirius ! No . Sirius ! Expecto Patronum ! Harry ? I saw my
zone2	I saw him across the lake . Harry , they 've captured Sirius . Any minute the dementors are gon na perform the Kiss . - They 're gon na kill him ? - No . It 's worse . Much worse . They 're going to suck out his soul . Headmaster , stop them . - They 've got the wrong man . - It 's true . Sirius is innocent . - It 's Scabbers who did it . - Scabbers ? He 's my rat , sir . He 's not really a rat . He was a rat . He was my brother Percy 's rat . - But then they gave him an owl ... - The point is , we know the truth . - Please believe us . - I do , Miss Granger . But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others . A child 's voice , however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen . Mysterious thing , time . Powerful and when meddled with , dangerous . Sirius Black
zone2	You know the laws , Miss Granger . You must not be seen . And you would do well , I feel , to return before this last chime . If not , the consequences are too ghastly to discuss . If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared . Three turns should do it , I think . Oh , and by the way . When in doubt , I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin . Good luck . What the bloody hell was that all about ? Sorry , Ron , but seeing as you ca n't walk ... What just happened ? - Where 's Ron ? - 7:30 . Where were we at 7:30 ? I do n't know . Going to Hagrid 's ? Come on . And we ca n't be seen . Hermione ! Hermione ! Hermione , wait . Hermione , will you please tell me what it is we 're doing ? You foul , loathsome , evil little cockroach ! That 's us . Hermione , no ! He 's
zone2	is a Time-Turner , Harry . McGonagall gave it to me first term . This is how I 've been getting to my lessons all year . - You mean we 've gone back in time ? - Yes . Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment . Clearly , something happened he wants us to change . Good punch . Thanks . Malfoy 's coming . - Run . - Not a word to anyone , understood ? I 'm gon na get that jumped-up mudblood ! Mark my words . - That felt good . - Not good , brilliant . Come on . We should be at Hagrid 's . Look . Buckbeak 's still alive . Of course . Remember what Dumbledore said ? If we succeed , more than one innocent life could be spared . Let 's go . Here they come . I 'd better hurry . Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him . Otherwise , he 'll think Hagrid set him free . Scabbers , you 're alive ! - Keep a closer eye on your pet
zone2	can't . - He betrayed my parents . - You do n't expect me to sit here . - Yes , and you must ! Harry , you 're in Hagrid 's hut now . If you go bursting in , you 'll think you 've gone mad . Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time . We ca n't be seen . Fudge is coming . And we are n't leaving ? Why are n't we leaving ? Are you mad ? That hurt . Sorry . We 're coming out the back door . Go ! Is that really what my hair looks like from the back ? What ? I thought I just saw ... - Never mind . - Let 's go . Okay , go , Harry . Go ! Get away . Get off . Minister , I really think I should sign as well . Yes , very well . Perhaps it would be ... Okay , Buckbeak . Come quickly . Come with us now . Come on . Keep trying . Come on . Quickly . Buckbeak . Okay
zone2	name only . - It 's such a very long name ... Hurry up now , Buckbeak , okay ? Come on . Come on , Buckbeak . Come and get the nice dead ferret . - Come on . It 's here . Come on , Beaky . - Here we are , minister . Follow me . - Now , look there . - Where ? - Look beyond the rocks . - What am I supposed to see ? Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster . - Oh , yes . Indeed , indeed . - And all the strawberries . - Come on , Buckbeak . Come on . - I see no strawberries . - Over there . - Where ? - Over there . - This way . - Let 's get this over , please . - All right . But where is it ? I saw the beast , just now . - Not a moment ago ! - How extraordinary . Buckbeak . Come now , Dumbledore . Someone 's obviously released him . - Hagrid ?
zone2	suggesting you had anything to do with this . How could you ? You 've been with us all the time . - Right . - Well , well ... We must search the grounds . Well , search the skies , if you must , minister . Meanwhile , I 'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy . Oh , executioner , your services are no longer required . Thank you . You 'll find no small glasses in this house , professor . - Come on . - This way . This way , now . - Now what ? - We save Sirius . - How ? - No idea . - Look . It 's Lupin . - Immobulus ! And Snape 's coming . And now we wait . And now we wait . - At least someone 's enjoying himself . - Yeah . - Hermione ? - Yeah ? Before , down by the lake , when I was with Sirius I did see someone . That someone made the dementors go away . With a Patronus . I
zone2	really powerful wizard could have conjured it . It was my dad . My dad conjured the Patronus . - Harry , but your dad 's ... - Dead . I know . I 'm just telling you what I saw . Here we come . You see Sirius talking to me there ? - He 's asking me to come live with him . - That 's great . When we free him , I 'll never have to go back to the Dursleys ' . It 'll just be me and him . We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky . He 'll like that after all those years in Azkaban . Harry ! Run ! Let 's go . - What are you doing ? - Saving your life . Thanks . - Great . Now he 's coming for us . - Yeah , I did n't think about that . Run ! That was so scary . Poor Professor Lupin 's having a really tough night . Sirius . Come on ! - This is horrible . - Do n't
zone2	the Patronus . Any minute now . Right there . You 'll see . Harry , listen to me . No one 's coming . Do n't worry , he will . He will come . - Sirius . - You 're dying both of you . Harry ! Expecto Patronum ! You were right , Hermione . It was n't my dad I saw earlier . It was me ! I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before . I knew I could do it this time because well , I had already done it . - Does that make sense ? - No . But I do n't like flying ... ! Bombarda ! I 'll be forever grateful for this to both of you . - I want to go with you . - One day , perhaps . For some time , my life will be too unpredictable . And besides you 're meant to be here . - But you 're innocent . And you know it . And for now , that will do . I expect you 're tired of hearing this but you
zone2	- You have ... - My mother 's eyes . It 's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily , and you so little . But know this : The one's that love us never really leave us . And you can always find them in here . You really are the brightest witch of your age . We have to go . - Well ? - He 's free . We did it . Did what ? Good night . How did you get there ? I was talking to you there . And now you 're there . - What 's he talking about , Harry ? - I do n't know . Honestly , Ron . How can somebody be in two places at once ? Hello , Harry . I saw you coming . I 've looked worse , believe me . - You 've been sacked . - No . No . I resigned , actually . Resigned ? Why ? Well , it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition . This time tomorrow , the owls
zone2	someone like me teaching their children . - But Dumbledore ... - He has already risked enough on my behalf . Besides , people like me are ... Well , let 's just say that I 'm used to it by now . Why do you look so miserable , Harry ? None of it made any difference . - Pettigrew escaped . - Did n't make any difference ? It made all the difference in the world . You uncovered the truth . You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate . It made a great deal of difference . If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year . Now , since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you . So now I 'll say goodbye , Harry . I feel sure we 'll meet again sometime . Until then mischief managed . Stand back , I said ! Or I 'll take it upstairs if you do n't settle . Harry . Wherever did you get it ? Can
zone2	of course . - What are you talking about ? - Quiet . Let the man through . I did n't mean to open it , Harry . It was badly wrapped . They made me do it . Did not . - It 's a Firebolt . - It 's the fastest broom in the world . For me ? - But who sent it ? - No one knows . This came with it . - Go on , Harry ! - Yeah , let 's see . How fast is it , Harry ? Lumos . I solemnly swear that I am up to no good . Mischief managed .

I want you to at least be able to shuffle from monument to monument . We got one word for that , and it 's gelato . Keep in mind that italian ice cream has about twice the sugar of American ice cream . Means you 're gon na want about two scoops , huh ? I know I do . All right . I do n't mean to bother you .

Um , it - - N-Never - - never mind . So , Paolo wants me to meet him at the Trevi Fountain tomorrow . So go . That would mean I would have to sneak away from the group . So ? I 'm incapable of sneaking . Were n't
zone2	adventures on this trip ? Yeah . We . We were going to have adventures . And we will . It just so happens that you have dibs on the first one . Okay . Just as long as we do n't do anything that would get us tossed on a plane home . Uh . Unh . Lizzie , are - - are you feeling okay ? Is this girl sick , or is n't she ? She does n't have a fever , and yet she 's in bed . Ask yourself why a beautiful young girl on her first visit to Rome , probably seeking adventure , wants to lie in bed all day . She 's ill . I heard she fell down at graduation , made a complete fool out of herself . I saw that on CNN . CNN ? Often , the nervous system collapses after that type of humiliation . Hmm . Do you have any recommendations ? Oh , yeah , yeah . This young woman should stay in bed . Uh , she - - she should also eat two

This is Rome . Nobody knows how to drive . Whoo ! Wow ! I do n't know what catastrophe is going to happen in Rome , but with Lizzie there , something will . What are you going to do with that information ? Give it away , like you did with
zone2	out by that . And you have what to show for it ? The pride of a job well done ? Try buying a PS2 with the pride of a job well done . Oh ! Matt , Matt , Matt . We 've been over this before . Cash up front . Melina , are you staying for dinner ? - I 'd love to , Mrs . McGuire . - Great . We 'll need extra energy to work on our summer reading list . In that case , I 'll make brownies . Oh . I 've said it before . You 're weak . Weak ! Do n't do anything without consulting me first . You rock . Hey , Paolo , can I ask you something ? Si , carina , Um , I know that our lives are a little different . Actually , like , several universes different . But does n't Sergei get tired of following us around ? Actually , Sergei 's my bodyguard . So , you see , between me and Sergei , you 'll always be safe .
zone2	you need a bodyguard ? Paolo , go ! Go ! I-It 's Miss Ungermeyer ! It 's our bus ! - Go ! - I can not . Miss Ungermeyer , did n't we just pass the Castel Sant'Angelo ? Yep . What about it ? I just noticed it 's not on our itinerary . That is correct . Well , s-should n't it be ? I-I mean , it was a papal residence and it does contain frescoes from artists influenced by the school of Raphael . What are you up to , Gordon ? N-N-Nothing . I-I just figure that , while in Rome , we should be exposed to as much Renaissance , Raphaelite work typified by chiaroscuro and Hellenic mythical imagery as humanly possible . Whew . Ah , Gordon , you are on the list , and the list is not a place you want to be . What is this ? Only in Rome , huh ? You know how to move that , or you want me to do it for you ? What are you looking at ? Want a
zone2	Over there by that statue . You see it ? Yeah . That 's where the artist Caravaggio had his opponent burned at the stake . Or was it the pope who had Caravaggio burned at the stake ? Either way , this neighborhood was tough . Paolo ... Si , carina ? Do you still love her ? Who ? Isabella ? Si , Of course I still love her . But like a sister . So , why did you break up ? It 's , um , it 's complicated . - What ? Yes , we 've been voted " best pop duo of the year " again . But I want to do more serious music . And when I told this to Isabella , she said flat-out " no . " I was forced to tell her , " This is it . This will be our last CD together . " Did she totally freak out ? She totally freak out . I feel awful about that , but what about me ? I need to grow as an artist . Yeah .
zone2	I just - - I do n't know , I had this crazy -- I just - - I do n't know . W-What ? I had this crazy idea that maybe you could help me . Come on . How crazy could it be ? Just tell me . No , I ca n't . It 's too - - It 's too ... - Please . - Okay . Isabella and I are supposed to present an award together at the lnternational Music Video Awards . Cool ! I-I mean , cool for regular people like me , but for you , I guess it 's like work . No , no , no . It 's cool for me , too . You get all kinds of free stuff . But now because Isabella 's so mad at me , she 's refusing to appear . The record company 's threatening to sue if she does n't show up . What about you ? For me is no problem . I write the music . I do n't know where it comes from . It just comes
zone2	? See ? So I can go solo . But Isabella ... She needs the help to sing . You mean Isabella lip-synchs ? Please , please ! Promise me you will speak of this to no one . Imagine what would happen to Isabella 's career . Oh , that 's so sweet . You still care about her . You 're definitely broken up , right ? Si , So , when I saw you yesterday and how people thought you were Isabella , I got my crazy idea that maybe you could pretend to be Isabella and present the award with me onstage . Present an award ? O-Onstage ? In front of an audience ? I-l-I 'm really not good in front of crowds . I could never do that . Of course you can do it . You are magnifico . I do n't know italian , but I know what that means . I do n't know , Paolo . I ... Do n't worry , carina , I could never ask you to do this crazy thing . No . You know what
zone2	is gon na help you and Isabella , then I 'll do it . Grazie ! Prego ! Head check ! Gordo . Gordo . You , Lizzie McGuire , are actually presenting an award at the lMVAs with Paolo ? No . Me Isabella with Paolo . - What ? - It 's a long story . I 'm doing it because Isabella wo n't . You 're gon na get up onstage in front of all these people ? That 's the great thing . It 's not gon na be me . It 's Paolo 's idea to help Isabella because he still loves her . But not romantically . Like a sister . He is so amazing . And he 's 1 7 ! For being so famous and used to getting everything that you want , he 's just - - he 's just so kind . For real ? That 's a lot to say about someone just knowing them a day . I-I know that . But I feel like I 've known him my whole life . Anyway , um ... I
zone2	had the most magical day of my life . It would n't have happened if it were n't for you . It was that good , huh ? You 're such a good friend . The sting . What sting ? You want a little mano a mano ? See , this is one of the reasons me and you are n't friends . I never have any idea what you 're talking about . Some dudes get the approach . Others , the sting . That italian dude . He 's big-time approach . I actually feel my brain turning into goo . Embrace the sting . That 's what you 're vibin ' from Lizzie . Wait a minute . Now , you actually think that I 'm jealous of Paolo ? Word . Oh , no . No , see , that would mean that I like Lizzie as more than a friend . You and I have trouble communicating ? You 're wrong , man . Whoa ! This girl looks freakishly like my sister ! - Ow . - Zoom ! Zoom ! Another freakish
zone2	as my sister 's . Huh . Why do we even pretend you 're in charge ? - Let 's see what this says . " Isabella goes blond . Italian pop duo Paolo and Isabella wowed the crowd outside a shop near the Trevi Fountain , showing off Isabella 's new blond hair . " They must think that Lizzie is this famous singer ! And if I show this to my mom , Lizzie will be so busted ! If you show this to your mom , it 's worth nothing . But if you show this to the italian tabloids , we will be rolling in cash , my friend . Interesting ! " We " ? Not up to toughing it out on the streets with us ? Not up to toughing it out on the streets with us ? I could try , Miss Ungermeyer . No , I just hate seeing you being denied the cultural experience of being in a foreign country . You missed seven points of historical significance yesterday . I know . It 's really killing me too , Miss
zone2	you something to help ease the pain , hmm ? Mmh , well , that 's really thoughtful of you . Seeing as how your teeny-tiny little body does n't have the strength , we 're gon na have to let your mind do the wandering . Ah ! " The Rise and Decline of the Roman Empire , " hmm ? I 'd like one report on the rise and one on the decline . Ouch ! If I did n't have a headache a minute ago , I do now . You do n't have a problem with that , do you ? Um , no . - What else do I have to do ? ? ? Why not ? ? ? ? Take a crazy chance ? ? ? ? ? Why not ? ? ? ? Do a crazy dance ? ? ? ? ? If you lose the moment ? ? ? ? You might lose a lot ? ? ? ? So why not ? ? ? ? ? Why not ? ? ? ? ? Why not take a crazy chance ?
zone2	help . You 're doing a very kind thing for Isabella . Uh , Paolo , where are we ? Via Condotti . One of the most expensive shopping districts in the world . We must find you the perfect outfit . Ah ! Oh , hey , Isabella , Paolo ! Ciao ! Your hair is so blond and , uh , innocent . - Who did it ? - Um ... The island we were on was really , really sunny , so it was j-just the sun . We must get sun , too , no ? Ciao , bella ! Ciao , Ciao , Ciao . They are so tall ! - They all want to be you . - They want to be Isabella . Sit and I 'll get Franca . I will just be a moment . Whoa ! Take your time . I 'll just be sitting here in heaven . Hard as it is to imagine , as we look at the ruins of the Forum , that this was once the center of commerce , religion , and politics in
zone2	came into being in the sixth century B.C . , and with it , a new urban culture was born . Uh , um , di -- Yeah , Craft ? Is it time for the spaghetti ? It 's 9:00 in the morning . So ? You never had leftover spaghetti for breakfast ? I do n't eat carbs . You never had a spaghetti sandwich , either ? This cultural experience is , like , so wasted on you . Excuse me , where did you buy that Prada bag ? Craft ! Sanders ! Separate . We did , Miss Ungermeyer . And thank God . Why do n't you people , uh , do something at your , uh , skill level here ? Take a 10-minute shopping break while I choke down an espresso . This dude definitely spent too much time on his biceps and not enough on his abs . Totally old school . Wha -- Nice spy , bro . Yeah , watch and learn . The slow curve . Works every time . I 've got to talk to them .
zone2	come to us . Um , eh , ciao . - Ciao . - Ciao . Do you guys speak English ? Yes . It is your friend we like . Word . Word ? Is that his name ? Yeah , sure . Do you know who that is on the cover ? - Oh , Isabella . Certo , - Certo , Do you think you guys could translate it for me ? Um , only if you introduce us to Word . Can I keep the magazine , then ? Deal ! All right . Let 's go . Ciao , Word . Word ? Mmh ? English ? She 's speaking English . Our single is in English and Isabella needs to practice . What have you done ? Uh , uh , uh ... You look ... You look like a schoolgirl . Maximus , what is wrong ? You love Isabella . Nice Maximus . Very odd . There is something ... something very different about you . Um ... Rest . The rest on the island did Isabella good . She is transformed
zone2	on this . You - - fix the hair . Fix the eyebrows . Fix the lips . - Oh ! - And fix the ears ! Fix the ears ? Jewelry . Jewelry . That 's a language every girl understands . - Ah ! Aah ! - Aah ! Okay . Diva - - good . Tacky - - bad . We 'll have to fix that . Okay , none of these are me . - Why are you laughing at me ? You 're not supposed to be you . If I have to go onstage as Isabella , then l-I 'm gon na have to be confident , and that 's the thing I 'm worst at . - We are all the same that way . - Not you . Yes , me , and Isabella , too . It 's how she works through her fears that makes her strong . Isabella does n't let Franca di Montecatini tell her what to wear . Isabella tells Franca . Okay , so you 're telling me to tell Franca di Monteca-teca-tecatini how I should
zone2	Vai , vai , You do n't like my clothes ? No . No . I-I love your clothes . But I do n't want you to dress me . What ? ! See , I 'm not your Barbie doll . I am Isabella Parigi , and I dress myself . So , choices . I-I need choices . Whoa . I really like these two . You pick . Both . Both . Wow . This is the exact color I wore to my spring formal . - Danny Kessler thought ... Look at all of you . You 'd think that I 'm American . I am , how you say , um ... awesome ? The island . You should go more often . Mmh . Goodbye , Lizzie McGuire . Hello , fabulous . - There you go . - Grazie . Grazie . I 'm ready for my close-up . - Whoo ! I can not believe that not one Roman guy has asked me out yet . Look . Paolo ... We got ta go ! I am Isabella Parigi , and I
zone2	. Whoa . I really like these two . You pick . Both . Both . Wow . This is the exact color I wore to my spring formal . - Danny Kessler thought ... Look at all of you . You 'd think that I 'm American . I am , how you say , um ... awesome ? The island . You should go more often . Mmh . Goodbye , Lizzie McGuire . Hello , fabulous . - There you go . - Grazie . Grazie . I 'm ready for my close-up . - Whoo ! I can not believe that not one Roman guy has asked me out yet . Look . Paolo ... We got ta go ! Where 's the zoom on this thing ? Uh , uh ... Hello ? Excuse me . Oh ! I 'm sorry . I was just ... Hup ! Head check ! Let 's go ! On the bus , then back to the hotel ! Come on ! Come on ! Go ! Andiamo ! Andiamo ! - Hold on ! Okay ! Hello .
zone2	- Huh ? What ? Wait . Excuse me , can you fix this ? It will not close . Why is it open when there is no rain ? This umbrella is stubborn . It 's bad luck to have an open umbrella inside . - In Hotel Cambini , no bad luck . - Hey , thanks . One at a time . No running . Ha ha ha ! Ha ! Ha ha ! Age before beauty , huh ? You look strangely large and familiar . Which floor ? Oh . Thank you . First . Okay . Little hint for you - - you want to push the button , elevator moves . Elevator is not safe . You an employee here ? - No . - No . Who are you to tell me whether the elevator 's safe ? I am Sergei . Sergei . You 're gon na have to stand down immediately . Just because you are one hunk of Slavic muscle does not mean you 're not gon na make it on my list ! Elevator is safe now .
zone2	? Still a little warm . Miss Sanders , would you be so kind as to look after her for me ? As in do stuff for her ? Why should I be punished ? I 'm not the one who 's sick . Next year , I 'm joining the mouth breathers at Water-slide Wonderland . You are so busted . You 've been out of this hotel room . What ? How do you know ? Please . Your eyebrows finally match , your hair has highlights , fresh manicure . I smelled acetone the second I walked in the lobby . Okay , but you did n't rat me out to Miss Ungermeyer . Yet . Not until I figure out what 's in it for me . Now spill , Dorkerella . You 'll never make me talk ! I-I know that this sounds insane , but I think Paolo really does like me . How could this happen ? How did you get my trip ? How is Lizzie McGuire living this fantasy and I ca n't even get an italian boy to buy me
zone2	do n't eat spaghetti . I 'd eat carbs if an italian boy bought them for me . So , I suppose you want me to keep quiet about this ? Yeah . I 'd appreciate that . Well , I 'll keep it quiet if you keep it quiet about me keeping it quiet . And when we get back home , I 'm the cool one again , and you turn back into a pumpkin . Oh , my God . It 's her . What are you doing ? Uh , it 's a long story . What do you want ? We 're closed . I-I just wanted to talk to Lizzie . So talk . I was kind of thinking maybe , you know , outside in the courtyard . If this is about that parallel-universe , Italian-rock-star , Lizzie's-suddenly-a-diva thing , I know all about it . She figured it out . Evil and smart . Embrace it . Fear it . You might want to take a look at this . I 'm on the front cover of a tabloid ! I wish
zone2	this great honor . Do you know what that says ? Paolo and Isabella are supposed to be singing at the music awards . Well , it 's got to be a mistake . I had some italian girls translate it . Paolo did n't tell you ? Mmh , no . Do n't you think it 's weird he tried to hide this ? Can you believe it ? Maybe it 's a last-minute thing . Are n't these things planned months in advance ? When did you become an expert on italian award-show thingies ? It 's called common sense , which I have a lot of to make up for my lack of the slow curve . Slow curve ? Forget it . If you want to believe some italian kid you think you know after two days because he 's an international superstar , is really rich and has nice hair , be my guest . Gordo . Oh , my God ! He 's early ! Lizzie . Oh , my God , I got ta get dressed . I 'll cover for you in
zone2	things . Thanks . I owe you . Duh ! Mom , Dad , I found something on the lnternet I think you both should see . What is it ? Since Lizzie 's in Europe , I thought I 'd do a little E-search on Italy . That 's nice , son . But what I found out , it 's not so E-assuring . In fact , it may shock you . What are we looking at ? Maybe nothing , and , uh , maybe something . You see , when polled , 74% of italian teenage boys said they would most like to date American girls . Where 'd you get these numbers ? They 're available for anyone who has a computer . You do n't have to worry about your sister . She 's well-chaperoned . Miss Ungermeyer 's there . Yeah , what is she , 5 ' 1 " , 5 ' 2 " max ? Oh , please . Matt , as interesting as this is , where are you taking it ? All right , you caught me . I
zone2	try . I 'll deny I ever said this , but I miss my sister . There . I said it . Now you know . I know I rag on her all the time , but now that she 's gone , l-I -- Oh , honey , we miss her , too . So , so much . I feel so alone ! Oh ! Listen to me . You do n't have to make fake pie charts . You just come to us with the truth , okay ? I know that now , Mom . It 's just so hard . I miss her so much ! Oh ! I ca n't believe I let you talk me into letting her go on that trip ! I 'll go get the passports . Oh , honey . - Shh . - Paolo . - Si , What is this ? Uh , a car . Look , are we supposed to sing ? Scusa ? Do n't speak to me in italian . It 's too adorable . Are Paolo and Isabella supposed to sing at
zone2	why did n't you tell me ? I wanted to , but you told me not to telephone the hotel . Get in . I 'll explain everything on the way . I want to show you the Tivoli Gardens before sunset . Come on . We have to get you back by 10:00 . Okay . So , where is Sergei ? You 're not the only one who sneaks off at night . Isabella and I were going to sing , but after Isabella would not speak to me , I told the producers we refuse to perform . I said Isabella had throat problems . So , what happened ? I mean , what changed ? Isabella did . The real Isabella or me Isabella ? You . A reporter heard her speaking , and he reported Isabella 's voice was fine . He said her English was very good . The record company called , and they 're going to sue if we do n't sing . What ? So , they 're gon na make you sing ? I-I mean , us sing ? Do
zone2	. Look . Ah ! Look , Paolo , l-I do n't think this is going to work . I can not sing in front of an audience . I wo n't even let my mom hear me sing in the shower . I will teach you all you need to know . Okay . So , what is Isabella gon na do when she sees me being her ? She wo n't . She 's off on some island trying to get over this . Come on . Here 's my vow to you . I , Paolo Valisari , will never let you , Lizzie McGuire , be embarrassed . If I fail , I have to spend seven days with that scary head-check woman . Her name 's Miss Ungermeyer . Carina , has n't everything I 've promised you come to be ? Everyone believes you are Isabella . You 're having the time of your life . You even told Franca di Montecatini to buzz off ! Do n't you trust that we can do the singing together ? I guess . Well , you
zone2	you are . Wow ! Hey . What do you got there , little man ? - Uh , nothing . - What 's this ? Uh , that 's not Lizzie ! No ! - Yes , it is . - No , it is n't . I know my daughter . I gave her that necklace . All right , tell me what you know that I do n't . It 's only a 14-hour flight , Dad . Swallow those biscotti . We got a big day . The Pantheon , the Colosseum . Oh . Uh , halt ! Got to get these apricots to McGuire . She looked sick as a dog this morning . Mr . Gordon , you having a problem ? N-No , I just ... I 'm starting to agree with Ethan . - We need to eat more spaghetti . - You da man ! Sorry . Is there a reason you do n't want me to go upstairs ? No , l-I just really think we should get going . Uh , so much Roma , so little time-a
zone2	I will get upstairs -- I expect to find Miss McGuire in her bed . She may be in the bathroom or - - or something . I 'm beginning to get the feeling she was never sick to begin with . No , no , no ! She - - She was ! I bet this whole thing was just a clever ruse to sneak out of this hotel , was n't it ? Yeah , it - - it was . It was ? Well , Lizzie and I were talking about adventures , and I do n't know . Ah , spit it out , Gordon . Lizzie 's upstairs . It - - It 's me . I 'm the one who 's been sneaking out . - You ? - But - - But -- Feels good to get it off my chest . You realize what this means ? I should n't look to you for a college recommendation ? You should look for your suitcase , Gordon . You 're goin ' home . Oh , I pegged you right from the start
zone2	agenda . Well , you 're busted . Love lifts us up where we belong . Wow . This place is so cool . Si , Are you sure it 's okay we 're here ? Si , And here is where , exactly ? It 's the rehearsal hall . But the Colosseum will look more like this . Sergei ! If you want to convince the world you 're Isabella , you must take the stage . You must dance and sing . Just move your mouth with the words . Oh . So you want me to lip-synch . - Si , Just like Isabella . You know the song , right ? Uh , well , yeah . I mean , I have your CD , but ... So try it . I 'm not gon na try it . - Okay . Was it awful ? - Uh , yes . But it helps to sing . Really - - really sing ? It looks more real when you 're lip-synching . - You were n't singing . - But I wo n't be lip-synching
zone2	microphone will be off . You must try . Please ? Okay . Brava . And now we dance ! Hey ! I 'm glad you 're up . I had the most amazing night . I 'm gon na grab Gordo so I can tell you together . You wo n't find him . What ? Why ? Where 'd he go ? Probably getting on a plane right now . Why ? He totally covered for you and got himself kicked off the trip . I-I do n't believe it . W-Why would he do that ? You 're seriously asking that question ? Call the airline and see if Gordo 's plane has left ! - Do you know what flight ? - Si , si , I will call . I can not believe Gordo would do this for me . Maybe he 's not on the plane yet . Maybe I could go to the airport and ... And what ? I do n't know . I am now on hold . This is the final call for Lufthansa Flight 6240 , departing for Los
zone2	gone . Who is this girl ? I have been on the island , trying to forget about this whole situation . Can somebody tell me what is going on ? I can . That 's my friend Lizzie McGuire . Let him go . Let him go . I demand you tell me everything you know about Lizzie McGuire . I demand you tell me everything about Paolo Valisari . I left him and all thoughts about him on the island . You may have left him on the island , but Lizzie is out there pretending to be you so you do n't get sued . We need to talk in private . Gordo 's life is ruined because of me . Selfish me ! What are you gon na do now ? It 's over . I 'm going to turn myself in to Miss Ungermeyer . Lizzie , you 'll get sent home , and you wo n't be able to help Paolo . I 'm never going to be able to get through this the way I feel now . Okay . Fine . Quit
zone2	. Now , you know things are bad when Kate starts making sense . I know one thing 's for sure . What ? I 'm not gon na have to act sick today . Mr . Craft , you are in the most historic and beautiful city in the world . Has it had no effect on you ? Well , actually , it has . The cobblestones are shredding my wheels . Switched to a pair of birdhouse pterodactyls . Have you even made a dent in your reading list ? I finished it . You read 1 1 books ? I mean I read the list . Shh . Shh . McGuire . Lizzie McGuire . Si , si , we are in the travel guides . No . No . No . We 're the parents of Lizzie . Ah ! Si ! I 'll call a cab . It 's very far . Anybody else want to step up to the plate ? Who 's asking for McGuire ? I had left you four messages already , but she 's been under my watchful eye
zone2	? Sweetheart ? Honey ? Cool ! Where is Lizzie ? Do you have any embarrassing photos or videos of her while she 's been here ? Ow . Uh ... Tell us where Lizzie is , or this deck 's gon na catch air . It 's possible she 's at the lnternational Music Video Awards doubling for pop star Isabella , who 's totally her twin . Why does everyone always look at me like that ? Prince William ? Tell him he 'll have to hold . Ooh ! - Oh . Hey , Paolo ! Si , What ? He said for you to enter from here , stage right , and I must enter from stage left . What about my dress ? I have to get dressed . It 's in your dressing room . Lizzie , you have time . Calm down . You can do it . Of course I can do it . This is moi we 're talking about . I do n't think I can do it . Lizzie , you must . We 've rehearsed this . You
zone2	great . I know . How do you know ? Because . Because you shine like the light from the sun . Paolo . Paolo . 31 minutes till showtime . Lizzie . Gordo ! What are you doing here ? ! Lizzie , that 's not important right now . You need to listen to me . I feel so bad . I can not believe you would do that for me . - Why are n't you gone ? - Long story . I want to hear it , but I 've got to get my dress on . Listen to me . Paolo is setting you up . What are you talking about ? Actually , he is setting me up . Freaky , huh ? Way freaky . Way , way freaky . That whole story about Paolo doing his own music and going solo . That 's Isabella . She 's the one that sings live . Paolo is the one that lip-synchs , not me . Isabella wants to quit the act . Paolo is just a liar . This has all been some
zone2	it looks like Isabella ca n't sing . Si , si , It 's true . Paolo wants to destroy Isabella 's career . But Paolo would never do that to me . I do n't believe you . Isabella ... Lizzie , who are you going to believe , this boy you are knowing your whole life or this boy you are just meeting who says , " You shine with the light from the sun " ? Okay . Well , then , you 're here now , so go and sing . But I am not blond . Paolo will know that it 's me , and he 'll make an excuse to leave . But if we want to get back at him in front of the whole world on live TV , we must make him sing . And really sing , not lip-synch . How ? What am I supposed to do ? - I ca n't sing live ! Change ! Change ! Change your clothes and go up there and do what you rehearsed . Everything will be fine , l-I promise
zone2	? 28 minutes till showtime . So , what 's the plan ? I do n't know . No , see , it does n't matter about the tickets , because my daughter is back there impersonating a famous pop star , so I got to get in ! That 's what everyone says . Enough of this ! - Uhh ! - Uhh ! Let 's go ! Did Paolo bring the voice track for me ? No . No , he did not . There is no track . Paolo says you 're gon na sing live , like you always do . Paolo and Isabella ! Sandro , turn down Isabella 's mike . - What 's that ? - Turn down the mike ! Sing to me , Paolo . Okay . Say buonasera to my new American friend , Lizzie McGuire ! Paolo tried to use her to fool all of you into thinking I could not sing . Lizzie McGuire is nice girl . You try to hurt her . Let me go , Sergei . You work for me . Not anymore ,
zone2	sing music . Now he must face music . - Was it all a lie ? - No , it 's just ... - Do you want to hear us sing ? Wait ! Isabella ! Go ! Si ! Lizzie ! Ru-u-u-u-n ! Lizzie got everything you 're supposed to get when you go to Europe . Adventure , romance , total confidence . Yeah ? Well , if all that can happen to Lizzie McGuire , the only thing I know now is I do n't know anything . That 's hot . What ? Girls who think they know everything are just a turnoff . Really ? Oh , totally . What about you not ratting out Lizzie ? I mean , that was just so ... not you . That 's good . Si , Mom , Dad , I 'm so glad that you guys made it . You would have never believed me . That is for sure . I thought after you found out all I did , I would be grounded . You 're grounded for the rest of the summer ,
zone2	Lying , even for a good reason , is beneath you , Gordon . Yeah . I know . I know . I 'm a lying , spineless , brownnosing jellyfish with a hidden agenda . I got it . That may be true , but I 'll tell you something . Little Miss Diva told me everything . The way I see it , you 're a pretty loyal friend , Gordon . And loyalty goes a long way with the Ungermeyer . - Hmm ? - Thanks . Hey , just think about it . We got 4 years of high school to look forward to together . Ooh . Sammies . Sergei is hungry . So is Miss Ungermeyer . You are strong woman . You protect cubs like lioness . Sergei is impressed . Hmm . You 're still on my list . As long as I am at the top . Hey , there ! I bet you 're wondering , who is this Lizzie McGuire , where did she come from , and what are her most embarrassing moments ? Well , I can
zone2	very competitive price . Hmm . When in Rome ... Yeah , yeah . Do as the Romans do , right ? No . We do not blackmail our sisters . As a former commander in the italian Navy , I am ordering you to leave the country . No ! Hey . So , one last sneak-away for old times ' sake ? Yeah . Sounds good . Okay . Aha . No ! So , are you gon na miss it here ? I do n't know . Kate says I should stay and have my stuff shipped over , because when I leave , it 'll never be the same . She 's wrong , as usual . You did n't have to be in Rome for all this to happen . You think ? Trust me . You had it in you the whole time . Gordo ? What ? Thanks . You 're welcome . Yeah . So , um , want to get back to that party so we do n't get in any more trouble ? Yeah . I ca n't afford any
zone2	4827571 THE MAKING OF EVIL DEAD II THE GORE THE MERRIER WARNING The film you 're about to see contains the most horrifying thrills in the history of motion pictures ! PLEASE DO NOT REVEAL THESE SECRETS Hi , I 'm Robert Kurtzman . Hi , I 'm Howard Berger . Greg Nicotero . Take one . Cassie , hands up . And , action . We worked under Mark Shostrom . Howard and Greg had worked together before , and me and Howard worked for Empire Pictures . Very frightening , very scary . But do n't be alarmed . Because you see , it 's only a picture . We met Sam Raimi on Evil Dead II . This strange little guy came in with crazy hair . A bedhead . He came with Rob Tapert and Bruce Campbell . He added things , like putting on the witchy pooh chin on Bruce . We just cut up our girlfriend with a chainsaw . Does that sound " fine " ? It was n't until we got to location that we started a friendship . What 're you doing here ? We were shooting nights in the forest
zone2	. We were puppeteering underneath . Books , and deer heads . In order to get to you , you ca n't hold me back . Then I have to push to get to your head . On Evil Dead II , Mark Shostrom was the boss . We were there with Aaron Sims , Shannon Shea and Mike Trcic . They built everything . My first day of work was around March 9 , 1985 . We prepped at Mark Shostrom 's studio in Pasadena until May 10 . We shipped everything to Wadesboro , North Carolina . The Evil Dead prep is over . We shot from May 20 through August . - Here we are . - Welcome to North Carolina . The production was set up out of an old junior highschool . They built the sets in the gymnasium . This is evil hand grabbing face . Very scary . For Evil Dead II , Sam drew his own story boards . We 'd ask how a shot was to work . " Did n't you see my story board ? " I 've recreated
zone2	a better job . - This is the evil hand . You can see the clock and the doorway . And that 's the hand being possessed . This is Bruce Campbell . You got the furrowed brow . Literally ... Sorry Sam ... These were the story boards we had . He 'd say , " Did n't you see my boards ? " " Oh , yeah , the hand is evil . " Roll , please . Begin the bladderation . Turn it a little faster . Another thing we learned about Sam was his love for slapstick . He 's a big Three Stooges fan . Gags were lifted directly out of Three Stooges episodes . The adaptation of a Three Stooges scene I like ... They 're getting a little pissed , so they grab grapes : " Hit ' em , boys . " They fire the grapes and go ... Only , this is the horror version . The scene where they jump on the trapdoor and the eyeball flies out and goes into Cassie Wesley 's mouth was a Three Stooges gag
zone2	humor was ... They had written a new scene . Ash goes into the work shed with Linda 's severed head and puts it in a vice . Then the door bursts open and Linda 's torso comes in with a chainsaw over its head . I thought it would be really creepy when we shot it . We 're about to shoot the Linda-chainsaw sequence . She 's going to come buzzing through the door there , and then she 'll come back to a point over here . - Where did he go ? Down there . - A little film joke . When the time came to shoot it , I realized ... Sam went , " Bring the muppet in . " We literally attached a plastic chainsaw to the top of the torso . - Somebody was up above ... - I was on a skateboard on my back . I was above with monofilament , holding the chainsaw up . So the door bursts open and this Kermit Muppet comes in . I thought it was n't as scary as I had imagined .
zone2	scare . Howard and I still laugh about it . We have your darling Linda 's soul . We did a face cast of Linda , Denise Bixler . We had to do the make-up and the severed head and all that . - So she came . - Oh , God ! It 's like someone just spat in my ear . We used alginate , which is a dental material . - This is disgusting . So cold . - Mix it , cover her head . And her body sections and all that . We had to do a full upper torso nude cast , which was fun . You missed the fun when they put vaseline and pam on my boobs . - They liked it a lot . - You liked it more . I hate it ! We molded that , and filled it with plaster . We ended up with a plaster likeness of the actor . We do more molds and pull out pieces that we need . For the severed head , we needed a clay sculpture . It 's called
zone2	. We sculpted the head with a smile . Sam wanted it like a china doll . When her severed head 's in the vice , there 's a hole in the table . The neck appliance was glued down so it brought the ledge where it had been cut off out farther . We tried to hide her neck and shoulders . She had dentures , contact lenses , sharp Barbarella-doll teeth . When the head 's lobbed off we use a material called 10/16 , a self-skinning urethane foam . It 's painted up , there was a wig on . We put eyebrows and hair lines on . For the decapitation we needed blood . So we ran blood lines and made blood out of syrup and food coloring . We rigged the head on set and lobbed it off with the shovel . We had to roll the head directly on camera take after take . Take two . Ready , and action . We were always aware of one thing : Red blood is bad . Any time a character was killed , there was
zone2	consensus was that red blood would be bad for the Ratings Board . So let 's have different colors . Even when Bruce chops his hand off , we do n't actually see it . We sprayed blood on his face . All that stuff was done to make it a little cartoony for the Ratings Board . But it was also the way Sam wanted it . Any time I had the camera on Bruce and Sam , they 'd say : " Hello , we 're preparing a very scary scene . " We 're about to shoot a very dangerous scene . So watch out . They were hooking a cable to Bruce 's chest to pull him out through a car . We 've attached a line to Bruce Campbell 's throat . I 'll be lying on my stomach , and they 'll hook me up through my skin . I 've got to go now . We know this is very dangerous . I hope you can survive this . They built a box that protected the camera on a pole . They 'd
zone2	out over the hood . A ram-o-cam . Sam just loved to torture Bruce . Bubble . Bubble . Now ! If you watch any movie , Sam tortures Bruce at a moment 's notice . Now attack Bruce wildly . In a lot of the video I shot you can see the rapport between them . They always have a good time . But when Bruce is propelled through the trees on the Sam-o-cam , - - Sam was the first one to smash Bruce with branches . That was his nature . He had slapstick but he was very mischievous . He was like the kid in the candy store . I think Teddy was tortured more . Ted Raimi , Sam 's brother . He played in the Henrietta monster suit . We had him in that full suit , full prosthetics , contact lenses . The first thing we shot was him bursting out of the sand . He got sand in his eyes , and he was screaming . And Sam said , " Do n't be a baby , you 're fired . "
zone2	. Imagine being completely encased , so your body ca n't breathe . How does it feel to be stuck in that costume ? It 's inexplicable , beyond your wildest nightmares . It was incredibly grueling . We 'd take off his latex feet and pour out an inch of sweat . It was white because of the powder . We had to powder his body . This white , sweaty muck would just pour out . He lost pounds and pounds daily . Ted was the first actor we saw . It took three months to do the make-up and the suit . We had a fiberglass body of Ted Raimi . As you see , we made a full body cast . We did a polyfoam outer skin . We did n't have an oven big enough to bake a full body cast . So we did fiberglass molds on Henrietta , and a foam skin . Underneath that we did a bean suit , a bunch of sacks filled with lentils . They hang in various areas . Then our skin goes over that . That
zone2	sit down . There 's lentil beans down here , what gives ? Get your hands off me ! We brought everything with us and Mark painted it in the shop . We 'd be on set and Mark was in the shop , painting . We had two suits , and a dummy that got its head cut off . Putting that together took about three months . - How many hours was it ? - Two hours . I need you to bite and start pulling back when you feel you got a clump . We did a reshoot where Bruce turns evil . Sam wanted a transformation in the eyes . Premorphing . Bob built this oversized head of Bruce . It had a liquid-filled eye , and then he injected milk . Then it would cloud over . I was the contact lens technician . They had to rehearse without them , so they could see where they had to go . I 'd run in , put their contacts in , and they 'd do the scene . But the contact lenses had no hole
zone2	They 'd rehearse , get the lenses in , and then they 'd have to act . So , when they jerk and do n't seem to know where they 're walking , they did n't know . Especially the shot with Danny Higgs where Bruce pops up behind him . You can see him feeling for where the actor 's face is . The scene where Bruce breaks the dishes was one of the first one's we shot . He did all his own stunts . Like when he flips himself after the dish-breaking . Bruce is the king of flipping himself . And he 's the king of acting in reverse . He 's the only guy that can do that . It 's perfect . This is a plate shot . Bruce is really involved with everything . His look , his gadgets . Peewee heads going down . Bruce faces off with Henrietta and her head transforms . We had the head on a big rod , and I was head-puppeting . One time we cut a hole in the floor . I had my hand
zone2	over the hand . - Do n't be afraid to hurt him . - Bruce kept stepping on my fingers . When you 're like this for 45 minutes , you 're numb . I said , " We should shoot this now . " And Bruce said , " Can you feel that ? " He stepped on my fingers constantly . We cut holes in the floor when the evil hand 's running around . There were so many camera tricks and set pieces . They built a piece of the floor where one edge was higher . So when the camera shot it , you would n't see the hole . We had actors with stump appliances . When Linda 's severed head falls into Bruce 's lap it comes to life , and she has her lines . Hello , lover . We had to work with the photographer and the art department . We dropped a fake head into his lap . When we cut over Bruce 's shoulders , he was actually on his knees . We had built a phony rocking chair and
zone2	her head up through a hole in the pants . It looked like her head was in his lap but they 're both on their knees . So it looked like her head was alive in his lap . You have to deal with the art department and the photographer to make sure that we ca n't see her leg or her hand . How was it , Cass ? Was it good for you ? It was . Put it back in , boys . This is how it works . See that platform ? They 'll pull a rug full of leaves with Cassie 's head over the opening to make it seem like the ground below her moves . Roll , please . Keep clear of the carpet . Hal Hide did all the physical effects : The blood , bile out of the walls and the creaking doors . There was a gelatine head , which Bruce shoots at the end . We shot that at 500 frames a second . I 'll swallow your soul ... Swallow this . Sam likes to come up with
zone2	had to be ready for that . If we had Ductape , Super Glue and monofilament , we could do anything . In the shed , where Linda 's head is put in a vice , above the door there 's a Freddie Krueger claw . A little homage to Wes Craven . When Cassie swallows the eyeball , it was a reverse shot . We put the eye in her mouth on a piece of monofilament . She pretended like she acted in reverse and the eyeball shoots out . They flipped the film , and you see the eyeball go in . But if you look closely , you can see the monofilament . Even though it 's blurry you can also see the rod . My favorite thing is when Bruce is being chased by the evil force . Sam puts a black frame in when we go inside the cabin . If you look up , there 's no roof , but there 's cords and lights . I think you even see somebody . - It 's the first chase . - Ted Raimi is
zone2	the whole routine . If you look at his ass , you can see a giant tear . You can see his ass and underwear . Just for a second , but it 's there . In one scene Bruce grabs an axe and hacks the character to pieces . We built a fiberglass jointed body we operated from underneath . So we had a jointed body that you guys were shaking . We had somebody with a hand through a hole in the floor , a leg . Orginally , what happened was , once he chops off the evil head , the body chases the characters with a big slash across the head . So we made this little brain and these tiny cobweb things . Unfortunately , there is n't any footage left of that scene . Sam asked me at one time if I still had that " lost scene " . The only place it exists is on the video that I shot on set . ONLY EXISTING FOOTAGE OF ASH EATING A SQUIRREL Take two . Ready . Action . Bill Paxton told me
zone2	woke him up , honking the horn and saying : " Come on , you got ta see this movie . Evil Dead II . " They went to see it . That 's how Bill was introduced to Sam Raimi . Cameron dragging him out . We worked with Robert Rodriguez . He found out we did Evil Dead II and he went , " I did n't know that . " " Yeah , here 's all the video I shot . " So we watched all six hours . He said , " I wan na see more . " In " High Fidelity " they talk about - - Evil Dead II being the greatest movie ever made . A lot of other directors will reference Evil Dead II . Frank Darabont kept saying , " No , it 's got ta be like a brow piece . " " Maybe weird eyes , sort of like ... Evil Dead II . " And he looked at us . I said , " You want a horror hag . " Sam 's script would say :
zone2	" Yeah , exactly . " It was funny . On " The Green Mile " the director refers to a look from Evil Dead II . It was like being on a vacation . You did n't get sick of it because it was so much fun . We all made 300-400 dollars a week . - But we loved what we were doing . - We were there to have a great time . Do all the effects stuff . It was one of the more memorable shows for the three of us . It was a blast . It will never be that way again . Cassie , cheek . And Rick , a little this way . Let me out . COMING SOON TO A THEATER NEAR YOU THE ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE IN GRUELING TERROR CONTINUES - You killed the baby . - No , I 've conquered brain death . I 'll give it life . Five seconds . Reanimation in five seconds . Oh , my God ! EVIL DEAD BABY Join us !

You probably have school tomorrow . Jones ? Do n't you dare . Jones ? Well , son of a ... Bitch . I have done something to make you angry ? No , not you . Yes , indeed , Mr . Jones . A happy bed makes for a happy home ... and Mother here is going to show you just how happy a home can be . My bed has n't been delivered yet . - Just you leave everything to me .

You go easy on him . - Okay . Easily the most exciting thing I 've ever seen in real

Besides , I still do n't know where I would sit . Are you sure that 's clean ? Your stalker has furniture . You okay ? Yeah , sure . How are you ? Great couch . Dear Dad : I 'm settling into apartment life just fine . I know it was more your stiletto move around a lot , place to place ... but I think I 'll stay right here for now . And why not ? It seems like every time I turn around , I make new friends . Jiminy . Let 's get . Oh , I 'm coming , I 'm coming . Come on . Come on , baby . No , no , darling , they 've waited long enough . I 've waited . Oh , how I 've waited for you . Each day a lifetime centuries longer than
zone2	... Would 've been ... Almost bearable . And it would 've been almost bearable ... if just once , you 'd written a letter that you were still alive ... and that your love for me was still alive too . How could I have known you lost both your arms in battle ? Damn you . Have n't I told you never to speak of that ? You foolish , proud man . Do n't you see it does n't matter ? You can still touch me . Still a heart to love me . Still lips to kiss me . You can touch me without arms ... and I need you to , darling , desperately . Please touch me . Touch me now . Touch me right now . Blah , blah , blah . God , it 's awful . Well , you 're good . - Really ? I mean , not just compared to you ? A glass , please ? - Oh , well , I do n't have any yet . Sorry . I find it awfully sad , really .
zone2	No , not that . You know , a person can pursue something . A girl can go after her dreamland give it her ... energy , labor , sweat , tears ... and this is where it gets her . A two-room apartment and a role in some moronic period play . Things take time ? - Right , things take time . I suppose , but I ca n't wait forever . Can I ask you something ? - Sure . You can ask me anything . Who 's the girl with the camera ? She 's called ' Jane . ' Why ? Well , she took my picture out here . She did n't say a word , just took my picture and disappeared . It was weird . - She is weird . You know what ? I 'd be careful if I were you . She took pictures of me once , and now she hates me . Hates you ? Why ? - I have no idea ... except I think she 's maybe slightly insane . Insane ? Hey , this is
zone2	, I 'm Jones . I 'm your neighbor from down the hall . I think we 're past that . - Right . I noticed you take pictures , and I ca n't seem to figure this out ... so I thought maybe you could ... I do n't know much about them . Is this one any good ? Yeah , it 's fine . Fine if you 're going to Disneyland with the wife and kids . Right . Well , I guess I 'll have to plan a trip , then . And a wedding . Here . Point and shoot . - Right . How did that picture come out , on the roof ? Not so hot . What did you say your name was ? I 'm Jane . Bye , Jones . Ready ? Beer ? - No , no , this calls for wine . I have a terrific bottle I 've been saving . You have a corkscrew , right ? Damn . Here , let me . It 's a sticky one . And that 's how it started
zone2	and pour and pour , like words on a page ... big words like ' ambition ' and ' inspiration ' and ' passion ' . Me ? I did n't say much , but she did n't mind . She knew I was watching her . I think she likes to be looked at , but I wanted to do more than look . After all , I could n't type , could I , if I did n't touch the keys ? And she was so close . It should have been easy ... but somewhere , somehow , I think I missed something . You know what I mean ? - Yeah . You do ? - No . You do n't ? - I do n't know . I 'm sorry . It 's late . I 'm drunk . I have to go . Morning , partner . Should n't I have handcuffs too ? Sorry , partner . I 've only got one pair . Do n't you think we should drink them first ? No . You 'd never hit them that way
zone2	. Line it up . Now , what are you going to do ? - Squeeze . Squeeze . What are you not going to do ? - Pull . Beautiful . Whenever you 're ready . Perfect . You squeezed . So , what do you think of Lisa ? - Lisa ? Yeah , upstairs Lisa . How do you mean ? Well , you 're seeing her , are n't you ? - Did she say something to you ? No . I just know . How ? - It 's an old house . I know the creaks . I know what goes on . When she 's in her bathroom brushing her teeth ... putting on a bit of eye makeup . I hear her move from her apartment to yours . You let her in . She looks great . She takes a seat on the couch , makes herself comfortable . You offer her something to drink and excuse yourself to the kitchen . ' Mineral water ? Or I have a light beer . ' ' Mineral water , please . In
zone2	Mineral water ? - Oh , come on . It 's not like I 'm snooping , really . I just hear it . There 's a lot of turnover upstairs . Everybody leaves a story behind . Now , I could tell those stories , but I do n't . And I wo n't tell yours either , Jones . Together this time . Six on the left are mine , right are yours . I love what you 're doing with the place . - Thanks . It 's called acting . - Right . That , that ... - Thing ? That thing is a product of ... Product of ... Hello ? Hello ? I can hear you breathing . Jane ? Listen to me , you pathetic bastard . - How did you know it was me ? You think you 're cute , do n't you ? Oh , for Christ sakes , Jones . You cook a meal for a man just once . He thinks he can call you on the phone . What he thinks is that he 's got God-given
zone2	to go , and what time to be there . Maybe he wants to show youth world . Istanbul . Mozambique . What are you talking about ? - You know what I 'm talking about . My father . You said he 'd been everywhere , seen everything . That he 'd written it all down . Every sight , every sound . So that he could show you the world . - I never told you that . He told me that . I remember more than you think I do . I 'm getting dressed here , Jones . - What did you do , Blanche ? What did you do that was so bade left both of us ? If you gave school half the energy you give this little genealogy project ... I bet they 'd name building after you . I am taking it seriously . In fact , there 's an instructor here now . Oh , instructor , hell . What instructor ? - It 's art class . We 're doing nudes this week . But she said I could sketch
zone2	you one . How I 've waited for you . Each day a lifetime centuries longer than the day before it . And it would 've been almost bearable ... if just once , you 'd written me that you were alive ... and that still loved me too . Damn you . I thought I told you never to speak of that . Never . I know you got it , you chicken shit . You can still touch me . Still a heart to love me . Still lips to kiss me . You can touch me without arms ... and I need you to , darling , desperately . Please touch me . Touch me right now . At least someone 's been rehearsing . It was bad , was n't it ? You can tell me . You were good . Can you say that again , please , with just a little bit more feeling ? You were good . Will you kiss me ? Okay because you want to , or okay because I asked you to ? I want to . - Will
zone2	will , but ... Sorry . I 'm not very good at this . - Oh , but you will be . You will be . What are you waiting for ? This is n't your first time , is it ? What ? Are you serious ? Jones , my God . What do you think this is ? Nothing . I mean . God , exactly . You know what ? You ca n't do this with me . Not like this . I mean ... You 're really sweet and everything , but my God ... how old are you anyway ? - Seventeen . Seventeen ? My God , what am I doing ? You know what , Jones ? You need to fall in love first . - Love ? Yes , love . Seventeen-year-olds can fall in love . By the time I was 17 , I 'd already loved three or four boys . Like really , truly , loved them . - You 're right . Of course I 'm right . - Trust me . You do n't want to do
zone2	do , but ... What did you say ? - I said , you 're right . Right about what ? - About this , about us . I do n't want to , like you said . - What ? Okay , the show 's over . I 'm through being an audience . Just looking on and listening . I want someone who 's more than words ... because if I 've learned anything , it 's this : talk is cheap , partner . So you say it 's a party you want ? Hell , I 'll show you a party . What did I say about coming down and celebrating ? Damn it , I got dishes at home that need washing . You done crossed me for the last time . Speak up , damn it . I 'm talking to you . Oh , dear God , help me . It 's Jones Dillon , coming to kill me . Please , Dillon . I was n't going to hurt her . Honest . You 'd best say goodbye to them buttons ,
zone2	. You have a shave scheduled , Mr . Dillon . A shave . And a bath . That 's me . But this animal said he was going to roll me down Main Street . Down Main Street , right out of town , one kick at a time . Squeeze . With spurs on , Jones . I need a ride . You did n't have to do this . - That 's okay . I 've been meaning to buy some records . We do n't sell records . I thought you said it was a record store . It 's just called a record store . It 's all CDs . Right . I do n't have a record player anyway . I do n't care if you do n't like the picture , okay ? What picture ? - It 's not going to hurt my feelings . You could 've at least acknowledged it . What picture ? - The picture I gave you . The picture I slipped under your door . I put it in an envelope and ... Look , there
zone2	it . She likes you , right ? Who ? - Who ? The bitch that ... Just forget it , forget it . I 'm sorry . Are you coming in ? - No . I do n't have a CD player either . Will you need a ride home ? - No . I 'll manage . How about you ? Okay , shut it off . That 's great . How do you know all this stuff ? I learned it from Rocky . - Who 's Rocky ? That motorcycle in my apartment ? That 's Rocky . He left that behind , the rogue . He was my last . He lived in your apartment for a while , but he spent most of his time in mine . Then he moved on . That was three years ago . It 's been three years since I had sex , Jones . Did n't you say ' whoa ' ? Three years and you say ' whoa ' ? Three years of celibacy deserves more than ' whoa . ' ' Whoa ' does n't
zone2	? - Well , the first 12 were pretty easy . But what about ... ? So you 're a ... ? It 's great . It 's really great . It 's the pain . The pain ? That 's why I like it . Because it 's honest and it 's real ... and it 's nothing you can faker hide . To me , it 's like you 're feeling pain for the first time in your life . And before this moment , you did n't even know it existed . I broke my arm once when I was a kid . How is it someone you 've just met , a person you hardly know ... can somehow know you ? Can take one look at you ... and see more in that instant than most people will ever see ? I suppose there 's only one way to find out . Hi , Jane . - Hi . Hi . I was wondering if ... if you 'd like to go out or ... ? - You 're a little young for me ,
zone2	Well , it would n't be a date . I do n't know many people here , and I thought maybe we could ... Maybe you should get a record player . Well , we do n't have to . I do n't do movies . No dinners , no picnics ... no walks . How about you decide ? I hear you typing a lot . What are you writing ? Letters , mostly . - Letters to whom , your girlfriend ? Girlfriends . There are several . Is that right ? Get the fuck out of here . Superfecta is the big one . The first four horses in order are bitch to win , but top-dollar pay . Trifecta is the same deal , but first three horses in order . Still 's a bitch , still good money . Exacta bet is firsthand second in order . Quinella is the same , but in any order . So those are good . Win , place or show bets ... you can figure out for yourself . Are you talking to me ? Yes , dummy
zone2	no idea . How about you bettor me and I 'll get us some drinks ? Sure you will . How did you do that ? - A trick I learned from my mother . So , what are we drinking to ? Close your eyes and point . New in Town . Yes . New in Town , run , run , run . Baby , run . Yes . Go , go . Yes . Yes . Come on , come on . Little Bee . Go on . Go . Little Bee , run . I used to go there a lot with Steve ... and he always lost his ass . I guess that 's why I can still stand it there . This is the part where you ask me who Steve is . No , it is n't . Fair enough . Then I 'll ask you something . Name ? Age ? - Seventeen . From ? - Texas . No funny accent . - I grew up in the East , mostly . Me too . Boarding schools and summer camps .
zone2	orphans got boarding schools ? Lots . Who 's Steve ? I thought you did n't want to know . He 's your old boyfriend ? One of several . Are you telling me you 're an orphan ? Not exactly . How many is several ? Would n't you like to know ? - I just want to know about one . That 's it . Out of film . - That 's it ? Why ? You thought you were getting somewhere ? So is there anything else I should know about you ? I do n't think so . Unless ... - What ? No . Spill it . I 'm a virgin . Never ? All those girlfriends and no action ? I almost did once . Really , when ? Recently . How recently ? - Pretty recently . I want to tell you something . If you want to hang out with her , you do n't hang out here , okay ? I 'll hang out here . Okay . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry about the kiss . So ,
zone2	n't do it . Sorry . Ca n't do what ? - Ca n't say . It 's one of those upstairs stories . Sorry . But you know ? - Ca n't say . But there 's something to know , right ? Is there ? Damn . Partner . She 's at your door . I did n't think you were home . - I 'm not . I was n't . But I am now . Now I am . Want to go for a ride ? In a half an hour ? Blanche is in Texas . Who ? - Blanche , my mother . You asked me about my parents . She lives alone . Drinks . Dates mostly men from the country club . She ran my father off when I was 3 . Or 4 . Her story always changes . What ? This is the part where you tell me about Steve . Is that right ? I used to work in this shitty little bar . Steve came with his band , like ... they were playing a stadium show or
zone2	sang every song for me . I had never met anybody like him . He said all the right things , did all the right things . Everything was so right . Then he fucked it all up . Me especially . You seem okay to me . I used to be better than okay . New in Town . How are you ? How do I look ? You look great . How 's your arm ? I 'll pull through , I think . Thank God . I 'm miserable , Jones . That must hurt pretty badly . No . I 'm so bored . Right . Maybe you should get a record player . Shut up . You know what I want ? I want you to write me a letter . A letter ? Yeah , those you write to girlfriends . But just a ' letter ' letter , not a love letter . I do n't have any girlfriends . I write them to someone else . - Well , I 'm someone else . Write one to me . - No ,
zone2	's complicated . Jones , I 'm in the hospital . I think I deserve at least a letter . I knew that something like this was going to happen to you . No , Blanche , really , I 'm fine . I 'm going to pull through . You see , Jones , this is what happens . I tell you things , and you do n't listen . You do n't ever listen to me , do you ? Well , you do n't ever tell me what I want to hear . Do n't you start . This is about you . This is about reality . I 'm going to have to hang up . I 've got breakfast coming . There 's a place that delivers bagels and belly dancers . It 's fantastic . - Are you drunk , Jones ? What are you talking about ? Here she is . You can set that down anywhere . How did he find out ? - I called him . You were bored , so you called . Wrong . I missed him ,
zone2	. Did n't he fuck you up or something ? What 's your problem , Jones ? I thought we were friends . He came 2000 miles , Jones . She ca n't help herself , Jones . It 's a biological weakness ... for the black-leather/ guitar-player type . I 've experienced bouts of it myself . It 's powerful stuff . Well , it 's good . Really . I 'm happy for her . She seems happy too , which is good . It 's great . Grab your hammer , partner . Did you see Jane 's car ? What happened to your arm ? You were with her . Well , I 'm glad you 're okay . What about Jane ? She 's okay . - I 'm glad . When something like this happens ... it makes me wonder if I should tell her I 'm sorry . Well , it was the deer 's fault , mostly . Is that for me ? I write them to my father . I do n't send them , because do n't know his address
zone2	or dead . Nothing . Only you . Okay . Say it . Only me . I 'll be leaving soon . I know . I do n't mean just from the hospital . I know . Hey , guy . Oh , the famous copilot . Jones , right ? Right . Yeah . How 's the arm ? You fucked her , did n't you ? What ? You ? But it was nothing . Nothing ? Jane took pictures of her . Sexy stuff , where she was wrapped in these scarves ... and I wanted to find out what was under there . But ... it was nothing . And I mean , Jane took it pretty hard . Jane takes everything pretty hard . What am I telling you for ? You do n't even have a CD player . Dear Dad : You 'll be glad to know I 'm recovering from the accident . And that girl I told you about ? She 's as good as new . What I ca n't figure out is , how could I have been so
zone2	person downstairs , he told me which apartment , so ... That Brad person ? Yeah . Do you know he made a pass at me ? Would n't you know it ? You look nice , Blanche . Then ask me to sit down . Well , thank you , Mr . Sophisticated . I got a motorcycle . Well , is n't that nice . Maybe I should throw myself off this roof ... save the trouble of having to bury you . I do n't think the fall would kill you , but you could try it . Tell me about this Jane person . Skip the part about her being lousy driver , though . I do n't know . She 's a lot like you , actually . - That 's exactly what happens . Boys always chase after girls that remind them of their mothers . She drinks , she 's rude , and she 's loud ... Yeah , okay . Shut up , will you ? Is she pretty ? She 's beautiful . What about you , Blanche ? Are you
zone2	's your cute way of asking if I 'm in love with anybody the answer is no . Come on , Blanche . Well , sure , there might be times when I 'm sweet on a man . I like to feel good as much as the next girl . But do n't confuse feeling good with being in love , Jones . No , those two roads , they rarely cross . Rarely or never ? Why are you still dragging around that beat-up trunk ? That 's all I have . That and his typewriter . Well , why do n't you see if you 've got a blanket in there for me . I guess it 's getting late . We 'll talk tomorrow . Tomorrow . Jones , watch the road . It 's beautiful . You guys are unbelievable . Well , all I did was beat on it . How would you like to drive it ? Around the block , or 2000 miles one-way ? I 'll do it . Why would you do it ? We 're friends , right ?
zone2	's crying . Crying , wow . I 'll only be gone for a couple of days . Shut up , Jones , and drive . - Right . ' I 'm sorry , Jones . I do n't have any answers . Not many anyway , and probably none that would make you very happy . No one ever looked at me the way your father did . He did n't see a pretty girl with a rich daddy . ' He saw someone with hopes and dreams of her own . And I would have followed him anywhere . Well , we only got as far as a little cabin in a motor court . I made eggs and toast in the kitchen , and we laughed , made love ... and drank whiskey . I was n't more than 50 miles from home , but it felt like 5000 . And those two little rooms , they felt like the whole wide world to me . But for him , I think it was just another dot on another map . I 'm sorry , Jones .
zone2	about your father ... things I wanted to believe too . But the truth is , you never met your daddy . One day he went out for cigarettes , and he never came back . These letters of yours are hilarious . I wish you 'd let me show this one to Steve . Where I 'm tied up in the trunk and you come to my rescue . I know what he did . What who did ? I know what he did . Trying to get me drunk ? I tried to pretend it did n't happen ... that I did n't know , that I could n't see it in his face . But why ? Why pretend ? Because I did n't want to go back to the way it was before . With Steve , there 's no yesterday , no tomorrow , just now . Always and forever now . For the first time in my life , I knew what it felt like to be free . Let me try . I could do it , Jane . I could rescue you
zone2	if nice is a problem for you . We 're too much alike . I could see it in the photos I took . I can see it now . Are you afraid of the dark ? - I thought you 'd want it . You can switch it off . This is not happening . Say it . This is not happening . You know , I 've been some places . Texas . Delaware . Three schools in New Hampshire . Kansas . Not everywhere , so maybe I 'm wrong . But I think you 're probably the most beautiful woman in the world . What did you say ? Nothing . You said something . I said , we 're here . Hey , guy . I ca n't believe this piece of crap actually made it . You ca n't do this . - Do n't . What 's that ? That stays . Right , the top-secret funny stuff . What was I thinking ? Last night did happen . - Please , Jones . What happened last night ? - Nothing . Nothing
zone2	and it was n't nothing . It was something . - Stop it . This something I should know ? - No . Yes , it is . In your dreams , kid . What are you doing , Jones ? Steve , stop it . Stop it . Get in the car , Jones . I want to talk to you . Why did you do that ? - Jane , what are you doing ? Come on , open up . - You 're better than this , Jane . You 're better than okay . - Come on . Give me a minute . Give me a minute . Last night was now , was n't it ? There was no yesterday , no tomorrow , and it still is now . It 's not too late . - Jones , it is tomorrow . I 'm here . I can not go back . Does it hurt ? I want you to take the car . I do n't want the car . - Take it anyways . You fixed her . You put her back
zone2	the hell out of here . - Yeah , let 's go , man . Piece-of-shit car . Let 's go . Let 's go . Hello . - It was me , was n't it , Blanche ? All these years , I blamed you . I thought it was your fault . But it was me , always me . Jones , where are you ? Why did n't you tell me the truth ? He left because you got pregnant . Because ... Oh , honey . Because I did n't want you to feel the way I did . I thought I could at least do that for you . What , so you could send me away to school ? And every summer . No , that was your granddaddy 's doing . He said that I 'd never make for any kind of a mother ... and I should just take care of it . You were my chance , Jones . That he might come back . I was your chance that he 'd come back . No . I knew he was
zone2	, Jones . They come into your life destined to leave it . You can wrap your arms tight around them . The best that you can hope to do is just slow them down a little ... because there 's no holding on tight enough . But you were mine . You were my chance , and I blew it . No . You did n't blow it , Blanche . Jones . Guess what . - You 're moving out . Guess why I 'm moving out . You got a part . - Yes . It 's a musical on a cruise ship , so my stuff is going into storage ... and I 'm going to sea . What happened to your eye ? - Oh , it 's nothing . Congratulations , Lisa . I left you something . It 's going to be worth something someday . You want me to autograph it for you ? I 'll just hold on to it . Hi . Oh , brother , where you been ? Here , hit this , man . Check it out
zone2	doing ? What are you doing ? What are you doing ? No talk , no rock , no rap , no crap . Nothing but today 's best country , 24 hours a day . Wait a minute . I know you . What did I tell you , kid ? What did I tell you ? - I think you dropped this . This is a new shirt . This is a new shirt . Do n't ever change that hair , okay ? What the hell did you do to my car ? Sorry about that . - Liar . What happened to your motorbike ? She just quit on me . Nothing lasts forever . Right . Do you still think I 'm the most beautiful woman in the world ? Shut up and drive .
zone2	3681074 In 1977 , I made a documentary about The Rutles . The prefab four : Dirk , Nasty , Stig and Bary . It made quite a splash . Today , I 'm here in Hollywood to take a look back at The Rutles to look back on those mop-topping , foot-tapping , happy-go-lucky days of Rutle-mania and ask the question : " Where are we today ? " Well , obviously , I 'm here in Hollywood and you 're at home or at a friend 's or at Veronica 's or wherever you 're watching . But tonight , I want to pose the question : " Did The Rutles change the world or did the world change with The Rutles ? Or did The Rutles not change and the world did ? Or perhaps we should all go and change now . " Tonight , I 'm going to be asking deep and probing questions . I shall be using modern interviewing techniques to harass and badger people whose only fault was they knew The Rutles . Indeed , I should be making a documentary that will hopefully bring me a bloody Emmy . Oh ,
zone2	, tonight we tell The Rutles ' story . The full -- - Jesus Christ ! - Oh , I 'm sorry , lady . - You better -- - What - - ? Get the hell out of my house ! - Seriously , we 're doing a documentary . - Who cares ? - This man right here ? - Yes , this man right here . You creep . AII right , ma'am . Calm down . All right , you , what 's the story ? Well , it all began in England in the 1950s . In the 1950s in England , popular music was very boring . In fact , everything in England in the 1950s was very boring but popular music was particularly boring . There were The MacGuffins . There was Nigel Pap . There was Jimmy Glimmer , " The Wallasey Warbler . " There was Vera Pickles , " The Singing Granny . " A large frog . The Rutles had been playing together from quite an early age . When they grew up , some people believed they changed
zone2	completely changed the wold . They changed the face of music throughout the world . They changed the world . They changed the world . Absolutely , they changed the world . They never changed socks . - I think the best thing was their asses . - Their bums , as you call them in England . These are four young men in their prime , wearing very tight trousers . They created , I think , the best music before ABBA . A lot of bands at the time were trying to sing like American boys , like American boy groups . The Rutles , I felt , were trying to sing like American girl groups . Essentially , they were black girls . Before I heard The Rutles , I wanted to be a musician . - And afterwards ? - I did n't anymore . I shall be doing my new album , probably , starting next week . I 've been working very hard on the material for it . I 'm probably writing better than I 've ever written , but terribly excited .
zone2	about my album , this show ? No , actually . This is about The Rutles . There was n't any real personal rivalry between The Rutles and the Stones . We were quite , you know-- Later on - - You know , met each other . But even at the beginning-- But people like to make it like that , you know . We were the South 's answer to The Rutles . And when we go to Preston , we 'd -- People would boo us because we were n't from the North like The Rutles were . Or the South was very proud of us because they had got something to combat Rutles with . I mean , The Rutles took us through the latter part of the ' 60s . They took a generation by the hand and said : " Come , let 's learn history . Let 's take the Tragical History Tour . Let us walk down Shabby Road together . Let us join up in Sergeant Rutters ' band . " And I do n't know where we would have been
zone2	not today , I mean more like 23 years and a bit . Actually , it sort of depends when you watch this . But anyway , about a quarter of a century ago I came here to this very spot in front of The Plaza in New York to make a documentary about The Rutles . I 'm actually standing outside the actual hotel in which The Rutles actually stayed in 1 964 . Actually , in this room here . And it was actually inside this actual room 1 3 years before the 23 years before . So that 's , like , 36 years ago . About 30 years ago today they - - Well , not today . Then , when it was 30 years ago they stayed here in The Plaza when they first took New York City by storm . Look out ! They 're coming ! They 're coming ! It 's Rutles Day ! It 's Rutles Day . This is Bill Murray the " K , " coming to you out of the WC . Nobody wants to know anything but
zone2	flown in , they 've landed , they 're in . They 're in . They 're at Kennedy Airport . Wonderful to be here . - Did you have a good flight ? - Wonderful flight . Arms are a bit tired . Why do you wear tight trousers ? - Keep the legs warm . - To hide the knees . - I ca n't hear you . - Where did you get your hair cut ? Shut up a minute . Shut up . The Rutles invented rudeness . - Shut up ! - Well , I think the Americans took a moment to get used to the Rutles , because America 's very polite . And so these yobs coming off the plane and being rude to everyone they took a moment to get the point of that . They 're here . What can I say ? I 'm going to put on my wig . Hold it . It 's Rutles wig time . That can mean only one thing . We want a record . I ca n't even keep my wig on
zone2	- How about that , then ? - What 's he saying ? They said to me , " Bill Murray the ' K , ' we want to meet the American girls . We 're coming over to meet the American girls . " Wait . I got an idea . I 'm going to say a word . I 'll say a word . I want you to react to whatever it is . What do you say when I say the word " Dirk " ? I got to go now , because I got ta sleep . Okay ? I 've been a big fan of Dirk 's . I always had a crush on him . How about Nasty ? I had floor-to-ceiling pictures of Nasty . And I had his picture on my pillowcase and I would lick it or kiss it and cry with it before I would go to sleep . Yeah , dig it , baby . What about a guy named Stig ? - How come you never say anything ? - He 's the quiet one . Yeah ,
zone2	horse , he is . I was very , very fond of Stig . Liked him the best because I loved the way he played . I loved his length . - Excuse me ? - His length . AII right , The Rutles . The Rutles -- What do you mean ? What word could I possibly have forgotten ? I said " Dirk , " I said " Nasty " and I said " Stig . " You do n't mean " Bary , " do you ? To start off loving Bary , especially when you 're young -- There 's just something funny about him . He was the funny drummer . Oh , my God . Bary ... . Not a good-looking man , and yet the women were screaming . I was hoping , when I was of age and got out behind my mother 's apron strings that I could sleep with some of them as soon as I could . I think it 's the kind of thing that rightfully should have been kept off The Ed Sullivan Show . Ladies and
zone2	them . A lot of us saw them for the first time when they played The Ed Sullivan Show . I saw The Rutles ' first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show . It was a cultural phenomenon . I saw them first , I think , on The Ed Sullivan Show . And , you know - - I mean , I was captivated and just short of being turned-on . I thought , " My gosh I 'm going to do most of my hair like that . " And that 's what I did . So through high school , I had this side of my hair like The Rutles and this side was short because they did n't like long hair in the schools . So I would sit like this in school . But then outside the school , I would go like that . A lot of people thought I looked like Dirk . But how did The Rutles get to number one ? Ron Nasty had been born in 1 940 and raised by his uncle , a well-known Liverpool ventriloquist . Who
zone2	very sensitive boy whose only fault was violence . At the age of 6 , he blew up his local school . It was a cry for help , really , when you look at it truthfully . I mean , it 's quite common in young children , in boys , particularly . It 's sheer high spirits , you know ? - At 6 ? - It 's normal adolescent stuff . So how did he channel this aggression ? He took up the banjo . The banjo is the perfect instrument for the antisocial . Steve , you play the banjo . - Yes , I do . - And would you play something for us ? Oh , sure . I 'd be happy to . I 'm sorry , would you play a Rutle tune ? No . No . He was always playing with his little banjo day and night , just strumming away . Sometimes locked in the bathroom , you know for hours , just playing with it . If you know what I mean . Yes , yes , I think
zone2	for it . - Yes , yes . - You know what young boys are like . I mean , they 're constantly , constantly playing with it . - Yes , I think we get your drift . - Rub , rub , rub . Yes , thank you . Shut up . At first , they could n't decide on their name . They were The Silver Rutles , The Ruts , The Tuls , The Sluts even Alma Cogan before finally becoming The Rutles . Ron Nasty , an ex-banjo player of no fixed ability . Dirk McQuickly , a left-footed guitarist . Stig O'Hara , a very thin man . And Barrington Wumble , or , as he was better known , Bary Wom . The Rutles were still very bad . And there was only one place they could play and that was Hamburg . There was only one place they could play , and that was Hamburg . And that was Hamburg . And it was here in Hamburg that The Rutles would discover leather amphetamines and shagging . Hamburg sowed the germs of
zone2	sowed the Germans of their popularity . Astro Glide , a German photographer , who took these shots gave The Rutles their mop-top haircuts and put them into leather trousers . Yes , I made them very , very tight leather trousers because you want to see -- Everybody wants to see their , how you say : - Talent ? - Yeah , the balls . Yeah , it 's very : - Disgusting ? - Yeah , exciting . You know , I mean I hate to , you know , blow my own-- I wish I could , but ... . I came up with the trousers . And they 're very , very tight . And that was important because , you know , they had to wear something . But it 's as if they were n't wearing anything . They played the Rat Keller in the heart of the ancient hooker district . Ancient hookers were everywhere . Hans Hankie is a German rockologist who came from Hamburg who has studied The Rutles and their effect on the world through his work as a
zone2	called the Shtupa which was designed to drop large penises on the enemy . Screaming penises . The Shtupa would fall from the sky dropping penises . But they changed it to the Shtuka because they are afraid because Hitler only had one ball and Goring had no balls at all , and that -- Hans , what about The Rutles ? Oh , the Frauleins . Crazy for them . Yelling at them : Which sounds like , " I want dick . " But no , it means , " I love you . I love you . " And they loved them . More than just love , they wanted -- Thank you very much indeed for agreeing to talk to us today . Oh , it 's great to talk with you , and will the check clear ? It 'll be a small one from the BBC . Oh , BBC . I remember listening to them as a child . " The chicken has lips . " We would hear your broadcast - - " The fox is in a nightgown . I repeat
zone2	crazy people . I wonder how you won the war with these strange riddles you 're broadcasting . But yet the French blew up a train afterwards . I remember my uncle said , " The fox is in a nightgown , " and the train blew up . Yeah , I have bad memories . So with their haircuts and their trousers The Rutles returned home to The Cavern . One day , a strange man with a pronounced limp hopped down the stairs into The Cavern . He 'd been asking a sailor for -- Well , never mind what he was asking for , because the rest is history . The man who hopped down the stairs became Leggy , their legendary manager . You remember The Cavern ? There was only one doorway . When somebody opened the door , light came in . I saw this dark apparition , strange apparition . Leggy was a strange man . Even in profile he was strange . Leggy , at the beginning , would walk around saying : " The Rutles are gon na be bigger than
zone2	He was laughed at because of how he waked . So he waked into these meetings at a disadvantage . When he said , " My band will be bigger than Elvis , " they laughed all the more heartily . But he was right , of course . I asked all the roadies who this guy was . They told me he was Leggy Mountbatten , and he was gon na manage The Rutles . But everybody knew that he did n't really like music . - So , what did he really like ? - He loved the trousers . I was amazed that they could sing in trousers so tight . They did sing high . It was the trousers . I know it was the trousers . And I went out and I bought women 's extra-small trousers . These were trousers that were meant for a little girl . They were-- They were pink . And I buttered my legs , and I squeezed into these trousers so that you could just - - Nothing was left to the imagination . And let 's just
zone2	put those trousers on . The Rutles were now legends . At the Lunchtime Achievement Awards they met the queen , who awarded them the MBE . Must have been an honor meeting the queen . She 's a lovely lady . She 'll be nice when she 's finished . - Stig , how did you feel ? - He felt very , very proud . And honored . He 'd like to say hello to his friends and pets at home . And he 'd like to request Vera Lynn singing " Far , Far Away . " - She does n't sing " Far , Far Away . " - She sings far too close . Lady Beth Mouse-Paddler is the wife of the British ambassador . That 's " Minto . " It 's written " Mouse-Paddler , " but it 's pronounced " Minto . " It 's an English thing . The Rutles visited you here in 1 964 . Yes , that 's right . I remember the occasion . Dreadful , horrible , lower working-class boys with appalling accents . One could
zone2	? - The evening with the ambassador was an absolute disaster . They came in very late , very drunk staggered around , shagged the staff , and left . - The Rutles ? - No , no , the ambassador . The Rutles were famous . Perhaps more famous than anyone ever before . They had reached the very barnacle of success . But the irony was , they had now become prisoners . Prisoners of fame . The whole world was in love with The Rutles but they could n't leave their hotel room . - What are we going to do today ? - What ? Hey , look who 's in the cupboard . Everywhere they went , they were stalked by girls . - There 's a couple of Judys here . - AII right , come out . They 're everywhere . They must be under the bloody bed . Think there 's one in me corn flakes . In Hollywood , The Rutles rented this house in Benedict Canyon . Two girls hired a helicopter and leaped from it into their pool .
zone2	The Rutles that made them so successful ? Was it the women , or was it the trousers ? Maybe it was their sense of humor , or was it their hairstyles ? Perhaps it was the Cold War . Maybe it was the Kennedys . What are - - ? What are you doing ? I 'm doing a documentary on The Rutles . - I 'm doing a documentary on The Rutles . - Get your own idea . This is my idea . - Well , get your own crew . - This is my crew . So it was here where The Rutles first began -- What was it about The Rutles that made them so - - ? Maybe it was their trousers , or perhaps it was -- What was it about The Rutles - - ? This is my -- - Trousers . Trousers ! - You shit . Get out , you Yankee swine . What was it about The Rutles that made them - - ? Maybe it was their sense of humor , or perhaps it was -- What was
zone2	- Maybe it was their trousers ! - Can you believe this guy ? - Or their hairstyles ! - Would you - - ? What was it about The Rutles that made them so successful ? - Maybe it was -- - Massive . The shagging was the fuel . I think a lot of it was the shagging . The Rutles is not all about shagging . It 's not all about that . It 's largely about that . The word " rock ' n ' roll " itself , after all , essentially means shagging . And so of course The Rutles were all about shagging . That's-- What is this music about ? Is n't all music about that ? I mean , did n't Bach essentially want to get it done , so to speak ? Did n't , you know , Der Bingle there , making all those records in the ' 30s ? Artie Shaw , I think , was all about what 's happening after the show , you know . Carl Perkins and Elvis in the ' 50s . I
zone2	dance and then let 's dance , " if you know what I mean . I 'm sure they wanted The Rutles . There was no doubt about it that at the -- You were ready to have sex after you listened to some of their records . I even knew that when I was 1 0 . There had always been girls hundreds of them . But some were more permanent than others . Nasty had been married early , about 7:30 , maybe a quarter to 8 . And his Liverpool girlfriend , Carinthia , was pregnant at the time . But Nasty was constantly on tour . It was no recipe for a happy marriage . Somehow , Carinthia was always left behind . Bary was the next to be married , to his childhood sweetheart , Brenda Liola . The wedding arrangements were so secret that even Bary did n't show up . When they were married , she was at St . Bede 's Church , Wigan while Bary was on-stage at the Scunthorpe Coliseum . " Why do n't we do it in the
zone2	it 's uncomfortable . You 'll hurt your knees , and she 'll get her bottom scraped . And then again , it 's cold . It 's very difficult to maintain an erection while anywhere , really , out in public . Actually , even in the bedroom , it 's kind of hard . The point is that there 's just too much traffic . There is n't any room to do it in the middle of the road . Madonna 's house . And we came here to ask Madonna the influences of The Rutles on her music what she thinks about The Rutles and whether she loves and adores The Rutles . But sadly , she sold the house and moved to London . We flew to Paris to ask celine Dion what she thinks about Rutle music but she lives in Miami . So we flew to Puerto Rico to ask Jennifer Lopez about the influence of The Rutles on her music . But sadly she 's in New York . I 'm in New York , and it 's tremendously exciting because I 've
zone2	Jennifer , apparently you live here . Is that right ? - That 's true . That 's correct . - This is so cool for me . I mean , I 've been trying to get a hold of you to ask you about The Rutles . Oh , I love The Rutles . I love The Rutles . - No way . - Yes , they 're so cool . I think there must be a big influence on your music . Oh , definitely . They 're one of the biggest influences . That is so exciting . I 'm just so thrilled . Thank you so much for agreeing to give us the time today . Oh , you 're welcome . Anytime . So from New York and Jennifer Lopez back to somewhere else . Golly . Oh , look , there 's Madonna . The Rutles were always innovators . Perhaps never more so than when they released The Triangular Album . When this triangular record came out you could n't get enough of them . First of all , because most records were
zone2	. And then when you put it on your record player and instead of this round thing just going around in a circle you had this spinning triangle . I mean , we did n't even turn the volume up on the record player . We just looked at it spinning around . It was so great that it 's never been - - No one 's tried it since . You ca n't even touch it . No one else has put out a triangular record because The Rutles did it . Period . They did n't do it first , they did it . Period . That was unusual when you went out and bought the album . Everybody was waiting in queues to buy the album . Then when you pulled it out , it was triangular . Everybody was like , " Wow , cool . " But how did The Triangular Album come about ? Kevin Wongle was a record designer in London . To actually get into a photo session with Ron and Stig and those guys , it just floored me . I
zone2	these guys I was totally starstruck . But anyway , I'II just give you a little idea . This is one of the mockups of the album , some ideas I had for the shot . As you can see , this was taken out of a toilet bowl looking up , and they 're all looking down at the toilet bowl . This one was actually on the market for , I believe it was three months . And it was selling well , but a lot of returns . Because , again , people were missing some of the songs . It 'd play part of the song , the needle would fall off and then it 'd come back up again . Sorry , it 's upside-down . This jacket sleeve , and with the album in there , became dangerous . Kids were doing drugs . They were chasing each other with the album and some , I believe , were actually stabbed . This image of the boys looking down ... . As it spun around , we found later on it almost looked like
zone2	. The Rutles came here to Hollywood . Oh , fuck . But it was here in Hollywood -- Hollywood . We 're here at the Hollywood Bowl . It was from here at the Hollywood Bowl - - Well , over there that The Rutles then went on to become movie stars . I loved A Hard Day 's Rut . I loved A Hard Day 's Rut . I loved A Hard Day 's Rut . That has influenced all of my work . That and some of the stuff The Turtles did . I remember when they all came out of the train and then piled onto the tracks and tried to kill themselves . So when the train left , they almost got run over . That was hilarious . And then they all came ... . Then they got out of the train ... . They watered down the train . You know what , I have A Hard Day 's Rut confused a little bit with Schindler 's List right now . Hard Day 's Rut was -- It was like an advertisement ,
zone2	was there to celebrate these four characters . The music is , you know , what it is . It 'll always be legendary , and those guys will -- But A Hard Day 's Rut was just , like , being with them on a personal level . That was wonderful . I thought it was funny . It was neat to see their personalities shining through . Anyone who does n't like Hard Day 's Rut should be beat . Oh , Jesus . I would pay money not to go and see A Hard -- Wild horses could n't drag me in to see that . I hated it . I hated it . Just how good were Rutle films ? Well , we flew all the way to New York to talk with legendary film director Mike Nichols about the Rutle films . - Mike , hello . - Hello . - Oh , you do n't mind if I call you Mike ? - No , no . Great . Thanks . Thanks , by the way , for agreeing to talk to us about
zone2	one of the greatest film directors of all time in the entire world ... - ... and one of my personal favorites . - Thank you . And I love your movies . I 've seen all of them . I 'm very glad . If I can start with A Hard Day 's Rut . Yes , the black-and-white one . Mike , you directed The Godfather , which was always one of my favorite films ... - ... and I was wondering if -- - Are you kidding ? No , I really liked it . I thought it was great . - Oh , fuck this . - What ? I love Ouch ! It 's hilarious . The funniest part to me in Ouch ! is when Dirk steps on the sticker the little tiny thorn in his bare feet , and he yells , " Ouch ! " I heard a few bars of " Ouch ! " from somebody 's car as they were passing by . They had it on the radio , and I just heard , like , three phrases .
zone2	, " as it was going by . And I immediately went out and found that record . And I just started listening to that record alone . And I listened to that record for-- Straight . For 1 7 weeks . I thought their movies were fucking endless . The only one of The Rutles ' films not to achieve success was the Tragical History Tour . In many ways , it was a disaster . Dirk will always say , " It was the best . It was wonderful , and it all comes together . " No . It 's ... . No , I 'm sorry , Dirk . It 's a mess . It 's just a big mess . It was a mess . Mexico ! And we 're here in Mexico because , well , we 're actually here in Mexico because the travel agent screwed up . He sent us via Cancun . He got a cheaper deal on the plane -- It really does n't matter why we 're here . We 're here in Mexico because it 's here in
zone2	to come here but they decided that San Francisco would be their final gig . San Francisco , everyone 's favorite city by the gay-- Bay . I 'm standing at the very spot -- Well , over there was the very spot where The Rutles played their last concert ever in Candlestick Park . Right there . Here , the legend came -- Well , did n't come to an end , but was beginning to come to an end . Well , maybe beginning to come to the middle of the legend which would finally end somewhere else . The Rutles ' last live appearance was actually out where I was in San Francisco at Candlestick Park in ... . - ' 66 . - That was the big show . And I did have tickets to it and then I traded it to a friend , my tickets to see The Rutles for 35 hits of acid . Now , this is a true story . That 's -- So I met The Rutles in a different way . The Rutles had finished touring and now they
zone2	, they were very strangely dressed . They were also behaving very weirdly . The Rutles were under the influence of tea . The resulting album was the classic Sgt . Rutter . I mean , you 'd thought the world had changed when Sgt . Rutter come out . Leggy sent me an advance copy of the tape and I had The Turtles - - You remember The Turtles ? They were at my apartment , and I said : " I 've got this tape for you to hear . " And I put Sgt . Rutter on my tape recorder . Well you 've never heard of The Turtles since . When I heard Sgt . Rutter , we ran . I had my trousers under my arm . I was out the window . I used to play that album over and over and over . Yeah . - And did you like it ? - I , you know-- I used it to fall asleep . And , you know , helped myself fall asleep , and it was great because you get into maybe
zone2	completely wide awake and thinking : " I am never going to fall asleep . " And I would put on Sgt . Rutter , and immediately , I was out . The effects of Sgt . Rutter were interminable . Some people even believed there were messages hidden in the lyrics . The Rutles always deny that they had intended to have any message on the records , but we 've all done this when we were , you know , kids . We all play back Sgt . Rutter and play back Dark Side of the Sun at the same time while you 're watching The Wizard of Oz while you 're slightly high . And it 's amazing how it all syncs up . And it 's an episode of Bonanza . Sgt . Rutter led to the Summer of Lunch . The Summer of Lunch , when there was all that free food going around ? Yeah , I got diseases . That was when I was really eating everything . You know , as The Rutles say , " AII you need is lunch .
zone2	came to a fitting climax with a live recording by The Rutles on worldwide TV . The " Love Life " sessions were -- You knew something was really happening . I mean , it was the first round-the-world , round-the-world thing where everybody round the world could hear The Rutles singing " Love Life " and be a part of it . But I was actually really a part of it because we were on Shabby Road together , you know , in -- You know studio two there , where you waked down that thing ? That was n't the studio . It was studio one where the big orchestra goes in . I was sitting in front of Nasty . Mick and Keith were there . AII the lads were there . Stig now discovered the meaning of life right here at this Indian restaurant . It was curry . He studied transcendental mastication under Arthur Sultan a former chef at this Shangri-la restaurant . I remember the phase where they went to the Indian restaurant . And they were eating curry and they found enlightenment and
zone2	others to join Arthur Sultan for a weekend of curry in Bognor . When it came to curry , they were anxious not to miss the boat . With curry , The Rutles had grown almost too hot . Now faith blew cold on their picnic lunch with a sudden and surprising loss of Leggy Mountbatten . With The Rutles growing and taking charge of most of their activities he just slipped out of their lives . Leggy had diverted into managing other groups and singers . Troy Nixon was Leggy 's assistant . - Lover . - Companion . Whatever . - He had quite the stable of young boys . - Oh , yes . He always loved attractive young men . He always had his finger on the pulse of the young boys here . They all had strange names , like Wild , Damp , Thunder , Clap . He tended to name them after how they were in bed , you see . You know , I 'm ... . Tommy Wild , Dickie Furious , Jeffrey Willing , Billy Is-That-It . How did he
zone2	taste in boys . Had The Rutles ' bubble burst ? Not quite . But night had fallen on their Broadway . The loss of Leggy was a tremendous blow . For solace , The Rutles turned to something stronger than a manager : Their wives . Dirk met and fell in love with a young dog and its owner , Martini an exotic model . Nasty visited an exhibition of broken art at The Pretentious Gallery , Soho . Amidst the rubble of art , which had been specially dropped from planes he found the artist herself , Chastity , a simple German girl . It was lunch at first sight . Do you know there 's this man in America who 's done all this research into vegetables . And peas , apparently , are very intelligent . They can read people 's thoughts . So I thought I 'd write a song saying , " Give peas a chance . " Well , he took her everywhere . I mean , even the shower . That was the beginning of " shower power . " The world
zone2	people , you know , and it 's supposed to get them clean but really you 're only clean from the inside . Is n't that what you said ? That 's what she said . The Rutles ' music will be remembered long after Mozart 's paintings or Beethoven 's after-dinner speeches have been forgotten . But what was it that drove The Rutles apart ? Was it their trousers ? Or maybe it was their sense of humor . Maybe it was the Cold War , or maybe it was the cold weather . Give me that . What are you doing ? - This is mine . - No , this is mine . - I 'm making this documentary . - This is my documentary . - Stop it ! - I do n't know who you are . - Well , you should know who I am . - Will you get away ? For heaven 's sake . - Get off me . - Get off me . You stupid rat . For God 's sake . That 's hurting . I'II sue .
zone2	do n't know . It 's a lot of things . I guess women , really . Women are a great divisive force in The Rutles , I think . In a lot of bands . Not in ours , of course , but in The Rutles , it was a big problem . How could you be a rock ' n ' roll singer if you 're married ? It 's not possible . No , you 'd have to have rock or roll , you know ? You ca n't have both of them if you 're married . As they broke up , they passed on to us the one great truism that I think all humanity can understand . That in the end , the lunch you make is equal to the lunch you take . And if you can abide by that , my friend then you will never ever say " ouch . " The breakup of The Rutles is chronicled in their final film , Let it Rot . It 's like watching a marriage fall apart . Only one moment enlivens the
zone2	the very last time on a London rooftop . That 's crap . Let it Rot was so bad , The Rutles were arrested . - Let 's go . - Get your hands off . Go on . The end for The Rutles came quite suddenly and unexpectedly . The Rutles had made a tremendous impact -- The breakup was the nicest part of their entire career , I thought , you know . There was a sigh of relief throughout the business that maybe we could get back to inanity and the driving drumming that is the essential key sign of rock and roll instead of all that complicated bullshit and bringing in orchestrators and video and all that nastiness . Sure . I thought , " Well , they 're broken up . Good idea . " As a matter of fact , it was the best idea they had . That kind of populist music is - - Wo n't last . It ca n't last . Too many people know it . Everybody can sing it . Everybody knows every word of every song .
zone2	kind of flotsam and jetsam . It 's nothing . It 's small . It does n't matter . It 's insignificant . It 's of no consequence . Of course it 'll fucking last . I will not do what The Rutles did . I will not break up . Where would the world be without The Rutles ? Where would it be without Dirk and Nasty and Stig and Bary and all their shenanigans and all their whoop-de-do and all their normal stuff and , " Here we are . We 're all lads from Liverpool " ? Where would we be without them ? Where would we be ? Could you think of any great communist rock bands ? No , I do n't think so . There was nothing called the Village People 's Republic , you know . There was no bands with two million gay Chinese . Here was a shining example of what it could be like . You could , like , go make music and make fun of everybody and get away with it , you know ? It was great
zone2	to their career is this piece of marketing extravagance . What am I getting for this ? They did say that you 'd be getting , you know , you would waive a fee . - I would waive a fee ? - Yes . Really ? They told you that ? That 's what the office said , that you 'll be waiving the fee . Wrap . - We should just -- - I ca n't do anymore . I 've got ta go . Can we just wrap it up ? And honestly , it 's not you . It 's the whole crew . It 's just too much . They 're trampling over what 's left of my -- Honestly , they 've killed my dog . I 've gotta-- Finish up , and out you go . This is fantastic . Say hello to all the people in England . I 've just-- I got ta go . - I 've got two other interviews to do . - Just one question . Bye-bye . Bye-bye . Bye-bye . Twenty-three years ago today ,
zone2	-- Was where this documentary all began . - Here was -- - Why are you doing this to me ? I'II tell you why . Twenty-three years ago , here -- Actually , here . Twenty-three years ago and here and over here , twice , you met my mother . Big Wendy ? - Dad . - I do n't believe it . - I do n't believe it . - I 'm real . Oh , my God . And what accent are we doing now ? I do n't -- It 's all right . Stop the filming . - The songs . Did you like the songs ? - No . Goddamn it . So shameless . So shameless . - It 's hard , because I 'm not a good -- - Comedian ? Not " comedian . " You 're a wonderful comedian . You 're very good . [ENGLISH]

So , how do you go on the subway ? I have never and never will ever go anywhere near a subway . You 're kidding , right ?

Where do they live ? Well , let 's see . My father lives in Arizona . He 's dying of lung cancer . And my mom lives here and works and stuff . You know , they 're very normal . Yeah .

You know , overall , I 'm not impressed with people ... and yet , you know , I still care what they think . It 's pretty fucking pathetic . I do n't think it matters how successful you are . You can always feel like a failure . So , are you parents supportive ? Yo , Reg , my brother . What 's up , man ? Come in my house . What you want , man ? What you want ? I want to see you . I want to share some time with

When was the last time you saw your father ? I do n't know . A year ago . Do n't you think that 's strange ? I think everything is strange . So ... what did your dad say when he read your book ?

So , are you happy with the reviews ? I have n't read them . Our friend Dr . Shapiro read your book . He said he thought you seemed depressed . I told him my son has always felt deeply about things ... and if the doctor can only equate depth with depression ... perhaps he 's projecting and to try to figure out

I have a hundred men working on a site on Long Island . I should at least show up . What are you doing here ? I was thinking about our conversation . What about it ? Just that , you know , you invited me to your show ... and I should have said yes . You do n't have to go . I want to . I mean ... Never mind . No . I ... I want

I have a stove at my apartment . That sounds a little risky , do n't you think ? Do you promise you wo n't attack me ? - I 'll try . - You 'll try ? OK . So , are you excited about tonight ? I do n't know . Baring my soul to critics . Let 's see ... I think there may be a few other adjectives ... I 'd use to describe it . It 's so fucking hard to become someone , you know . You are someone . Hi , Will . This is Flora . You said you were going to call last night . Anyway , call me when you get in .

zone2	4619183 It 's a great tragedy when people hear the name Joan Crawford . The first thing they think of is , " No more wire hangers . " There is another Joan Crawford that people should remember . She really had to work her way ... ... froma nothing , from being a chorus girl . Oh , she was a perfectionist and so professional . Crawford was very elegant and nice , but you never quite believed what she said . There were very few moments that I can ever remember her just being a person . She was just a control freak . She did n't wan na be remembered for shadows in her life . I think to deny Joan Crawford her place in Hollywood history ... ... istoeliminatethe center of the whole story . She is really the ultimate movie star . Get out , Veda . Get your things out of this house before I throw them into the street . Get out before I kill you . When she came to the studio , she was nobody . Just a dancer . A 1925 MGM memo announced the arrival of a contract player
zone2	. Signed by Vice President Harry Rapf , her contract gave the studio the option to discard her within 1 0 weeks . So Lucille Le Sueur entered running . With limitless drive , she observed work on the lot , made contacts and sought every opportunity to generate publicity in order to succeed in silent pictures . In this 1925 studio short subject , Lucille was presented to audiences as a new find , and made the most of her first close-up . But her attempts at landing roles yielded only extra work . The big stars then were Lillian Gish and Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo . She lobbied for parts in prestige films such as Lady of the Night featuring Norma Shearer , who was conducting an off-screen liaison with studio chief , Irving Thalberg . The character Norma Shearer was playing was a twin . There was a good sister and bad sister . And when you needed the backside of the head , that was Lucille 's head . I do n't think that she got a very good impression of Norma Shearer . It
zone2	's first break came in Pretty Ladies ... ... where in this scene , she was little more than a glorified chorus girl . But later in the film , she was given a featured role opposite Zasu Pitts . This role generated publicity for Lucille Le Sueur who was making a noise on the lot . She 'd broken through to positive public reaction of the film and had made an important alliance with film star William Haines who encouraged her to get to know the right people to aid in her rise to fame . Namely , studio heads Irving Thalberg and Louis B . Mayer . But Lucille 's wild nightlife as an exhibition dancer was getting attention as well . She was gaining a reputation as a fast and loose party girl with a penchant for dancing , drinking and men . She used to go to the Cocoanut Grove , and she loved to dance . She loved the crowds and the crowds loved her . She loved to do the Charleston . She used to go there every week . And she told me
zone2	very wealthy boy from the Cudahy family . The meatpackers family . But the Cudahy romance was not to endure intervention from his family who found her unsuitable for their son . She was , after all , a movie actress and came from a background that was questionable at best . The young actress was born into an impoverished Oklahoma family in 1906 . I do n't think she really knew her biological father . I think he left when she was very little . She did not get along with her mother and her brother ... ... and_i don'tthinkshe everreallydid . She always thought that Grandmother Anna loved Hal the best . She , as the girl , was left out . She took the name Billie Cassin ... ... **28;2726;TOOLONG vaudeville house , and then he left . The first love of a girl 's life is her father . If she does n't trust her father ... ... **33;2756;TOOLONG , I think that stamps her ... ... fortherestofherlife to distrust men . She very often talked about how humiliated she was ... ... whenshewasgoingtoschool , where
zone2	... togetan education . She started her career in show business as a dancer in clubs ... ... inChicago , KansasCity , andwent to Broadway and was a chorus girl . She worked at Roseland as a dance girl for hire ... ... **28;2791;TOOLONG under contract as a dancer ... ... notasan actress . After only a few months at MGM , L.B . Mayer promoted his new starlet by running a contest to rename Lucille Le Sueur a name he felt sounded too much like " sewer . " The first choice was Joan Arden , but as that was taken the second choice won for the name Joan Crawford and a new star was born . When she was named Joan Crawford , things started to crystallize for her . She finally started to have an identity . She created Joan Crawford . That was a wall for her to shut out that miserable childhood . She 'd crossed certain railroad tracks , but she still could hear the train roar . Her first break as Joan Crawford was a leading role in , Sally , Irene and
zone2	pictures with Joan Crawford . I did n't consider her a great actress . No , not in the beginning at all . The studio was uncertain about what to do with their free-spirited starlet and tried her out in comedies , dramas and even Westerns , to moderate response . But L.B . Mayer followed a hunch , and took a chance on her with a starring role in The Taxi Dancer . Crawford was a natural on the screen . Whether from a youthful zeal , or a lack of education she came across as a fresh , new face in an age of affectation . But industry opinion rumored that Joan ' s inexperience contributed to the film ' s failure . Once again , she was assigned to supporting roles . In her next film , Joan played a seedy carnival performer opposite Lon Chaney in The Unknown . It was on this project that she received an education by observing her costar 's total immersion in his character . She was learning to use inner resources from an unhappy and abused childhood to make her
zone2	an actress . With renewed interest , MGM made her a leading lady to the studio ' s top star , John Gilbert , in Twelve Miles Out . Their on-screen chemistry struck a chord with audiences . Off-screen , Crawford continued to better herself at MGM . She went on the other sound stages to watch the other productions . She took that time to learn as much as she could , and also to make friends ... ... becauseshefoundout that your friends behind the camera ... ... **25;2821;TOOLONG fellow players in front of the camera . Joan ' s achievements were noted in Mayer 's office . She was one of his greatest discoveries , and was rewarded in kind with a down payment for her first home , in Beverly Hills . She was even given a new car by the studio but not all was going well for Crawford , whose reckless drinking led to her involvement as the driver in a hit-and-run accident . A matter which was silenced by the studio . Joan ' s friend William Haines advised discretion to protect her public
zone2	the price of fame . Crawford and Haines remained the best of friends for the rest of their lives . MGM cashed in on their much publicized friendship by teaming them romantically in two films . He was already playing leads at that point . He kind of let her in on the rules of the game . The two of them were just friends . They could be comfortable with each other . They 'd share a lot of intimacies , as far as their little secrets . Actually , it was when she was back in New York doing West Point ... ... **29;2848;TOOLONG probably her first trouble ... ... withthestudio , becauseacadet actually got kicked out of West Point ... ... forgoingon adatewith her . Shortly after that , she and Billy got into a car crash . The studio was n't too happy about this when they got back to Hollywood . Joan Crawford made the , I thought , rather impudent remark : " How can you get a decent part in a picture ... ... whenNormaShearer sleeps with the boss ? " Joan could
zone2	'd go up to the bosses , including Irving Thalberg , and complain : " Norma gets everything , and I just get the other stuff . " Irving was very protective of Norma and he bristled at this ... ... andheputher ina Western with Tim McCoy . Joan served her time . She learned a lesson : Do n't mess with Irving Thalberg . Next , Joan was given a starring role in a film that would cement her fame : Our Dancing Daughters . In the movie , Crawford came through as her own unique creation which MGM had been avoiding from the beginning . This was the Joan that had been in the nightclubs the Joan that had been impressing everybody else . She was finally allowed to be free , and the public reaction was monumental . Our Dancing Daughters . Oh , I love it . Those pictures made us famous . Crawford was supposed to be the one that did all the dancing and everything ... ... butwaspure , and Iwastheonethat was supposed to be sweet but was n't ... ... andgotthewealthyman and it
zone2	we made two more . You see some of those pictures today and they 're really laughable ... ... becausesheis so flutteryand dances up a storm and plays very coy . F . Scott Fitzgerald noted : " Joan Crawford is doubtless the best example of the flapper . The girl you see in smart nightclubs gowned to the apex of sophistication . Toying iced glasses with a remote , faintly bitter expression . Dancing deliciously . Laughing a great deal with wide , hurt eyes . Young things with a talent for living . " Filmdom had a new star and hers was the ultimate Cinderella story . That of a flapper who had made it through the ranks to become a credible actress and a genuine box-office movie star . Crawford 's salary had slowly increased to $ 250 a week . But after the success of Our Dancing Daughters , MGM doubled her income . Her prosperity paid for a new house in the fashionable Brentwood neighborhood . She hosted glittering parties , attended premieres and answered a flood of fan mail . Joan had it all
zone2	studio in Hollywood . But she lacked the social standing befitting her position in the film community . She met Douglas Fairbanks , Jr . in the fall of 1 927 . He was performing in Hollywood in a play called Young Woodley . She sent him a note telling him ... ... howimpressedshehad been by his performance . The movie magazines rumored of the budding romance between Metro ' s box office star and the son of one of the 1 0 most famous men on earth . Pickfair was the pi ? ce de r ? sistance of all actors . To be invited to Pickfair , that was - - You 'd made it in Hollywood . But the word from Pickfair was negative toward Crawford whose wild nightlife provoked the disparagement of Douglas Fairbanks , Sr and his wife , Mary Pickford . Once again , Joan was found unsuitable to sit at the table with the privileged class . It 's funny how Hollywood royalty were all sort of ... ... **26;2879;TOOLONG ... ... andhowquicklytheybecame the heirs of aristocracy ... ... because , actually ,
zone2	May 1929 , Joan Crawford was immortalized in the forecourt at Grauman ' s Chinese Theatre . The following month , the couple married in New York where the absence of Mary and Doug , Sr was not looked upon unfavorably by the press . When they got married , it was like a fairy tale . They were Hollywood royalty . The press just went crazy . Tremendous amount of publicity , and for obvious reasons , inspired by MGM ... ... towhomshewas undercontract . But it was overblown in the press . It was just almost silly to just sit aside ... ... andseehowmuchattention was paid to it . We made a trip to Europe as a delayed honeymoon ... ... butshewasreallyunhappy during the whole trip ... ... andcouldn'twaittogetback to Culver City , get back to Hollywood . Joan Crawford was most at home in Hollywood . A place where she could enjoy her new marriage to Douglas Fairbanks , Jr and her newfound stardom . Her box-office receipts rivaled those of Greta Garbo and Norma Shearer and ultimately , her financial success earned the good graces of
zone2	sequel to Our Dancing Daughters entitled Our Modern Maidens awarding Fairbanks a costarring role . The talkies came to Hollywood , and some of the greatest stars of the silent era came to perish in risky projects . By yonder blessed moon I swear , which tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops -- MGM put forth a great effort in selling their stable of stars in the all-talking , all-singing Hollywood Revue of 1 929 . And audiences heard Crawford for the first time . At MGM , they had some voice coaches . If you look at the old films , everybody has this coached voice .

It 's really around Letty Lynton thatshecomesinto what I would call her face . Where the lips , the eyebrows , the eyes -- You finally see the Joan Crawford face . The famous Crawford lips became almost a joke in Hollywood . But they were a great trademark for her . The eyebrows , which she exaggerated , also became a trademark of hers . I do n't think I ever knew anyone who was so aware ... ... **26;2907;TOOLONG as was Joan . Her wardrobe of gowns , dresses and suits were by the famed costume designer , Adrian .

They can cure anything these days . - You think so ? - Of course . You 'll see . She had no scenes with Garbo , which she regretted . It was a very sympathetic role , and she was thrilled to be in that company . It did a great deal for her . In the wake of her greatest triumph , Joan lobbied to go on loan-out to United Artists to play Sadie Thompson in Rain . It really is a remarkable piece of acting . I think it was the best thing she had done that far in her career . What 's touching about her performance is the rawness ... ... **27;2964;TOOLONG Joan Crawford yet . - You 've got to go back to San Francisco . - Oh , no , Mr . Davidson .

It was a flop and she never forgot it . Joan Crawford tended to base her opinions of her films

No one has any rights about me except me . Bette and Joan first encountered each other at a press party for the cinema ' s hottest newcomers . Bette was addressing the press when Joan , already an established star . swept into the room , effectively upstaging Davis . Bette was pretty contemptuous of Joan . Bette Davis vowed then and there to knock Joan Crawford off her high horse . It was the end of her marriage to Doug Fairbanks , Jr . It was n't just Joan seeing somebody . He was seeing other people , and had been involved in a couple ... ... **28;3021;TOOLONG . He needed to break free of this movie-star world . Because she was very happy in that world , and he was n't . In May 1933 , Joan Crawford filed for divorce . She was about to begin a new chapter in her life .
zone2	the musical Dancing Lady , which capitalized on the success of the Busby Berkeley musicals at Warner Bros . The plot accented a love triangle between Joan ' s plucky hoofer who wins the hearts of Broadway producer Clark Gable and wealthy playboy Franchot Tone . Franchot Tone was a gentleman of the Eastern school . He was a very charming person who came from money in the East . She had never known anybody like that intimately . So I think she became enamored with him . Tabloids hinted that Crawford was dating her handsome costar , Tone . But her joy was circumvented by family problems . She did n't get along with her mother . Also she had a brother that she did n't care for , who gave her a lot of trouble . It 's par for the course that when one of the family gets to be a star ... ... **29;3051;TOOLONG pretty miserable . Strangely enough , Bette Davis had a sister who gave her a lot of trouble . While filming Chained with Clark Gable , Joan finally met her biological father
zone2	trying to make a relationship that never quite succeeded . On his last day in town , I looked across the sound stage and saw his eyes filled with tears . He waved goodbye and blew me a kiss , and I never saw him again . " Crawford had become a creature of extremes . She knitted furiously , complaining of having nervous hands . She maintained an exhaustive exercise regimen . She had a pretty body and always carried clothes very well . She became bewitched by gardenias , and every day for nearly four years she wore or held the flower almost every waking moment . She was a Christian Scientist ... ... **27;3082;TOOLONG , and she was devout . She was notoriously controlling in her friendships . She was very possessive of her friends . When she could n't touch base , she would have a fit . Crawford was slavishly devoted to corresponding with her fans and contended that they were solely responsible for her stardom . More than any actress that I ever worked with ... ... shewasawareofthepublic . She knew how to get
zone2	one with cleanliness . Everything was perfect in her house , up to Emily Post . She cleaned out all the ashtrays . She was on her hands and knees ... ... goingaroundthesofa , where people had dropped things . She just wanted to make sure it was right in the morning when she got up . Crawford began a successful collaboration with writer-producer Joseph Mankiewicz ... ... in which her person on-screen was developing a more independent and commanding air . It 's my life and I 'll live it the way I want . Upside down , catty-corner or sliding down a pole . She portrayed a woman that was becoming the American woman . The woman that did n't have a father , husband , brother ... ... orloverto takecareof and protect her . MGM had signed her to play a number of sophisticates .. ... and feather light comedies , as well , with Franchot Tone whom she lobbied to be her costar . Tone had begun to propose marriage to Joan , who once told a reporter : " If anyone ever catches me marrying
zone2	the jaw . " Tone encouraged her to spread her wings artistically ... ... by performing the classics on the radio , such as Ibsen ' s A Doll 's House . I 've been your doll-wife , just as I used to be Father 's doll-child and in the same way , my children have been my dolls . That 's what our marriage has been , Torvald . Before one such radio performance , on October 1 1 th , 1935 Joan Crawford married Franchot Tone . He was educated , cultured . She had great ambitions to be educated and cultured . At home , Joan and Franchot spent quiet evenings together . He introduced her to the works of Chekhov , Shaw and Shakespeare . For Crawford , it was a new and exhilarating world of ideas . Ironically , with Crawford 's cultural awakening both on-screen and off there came a downturn in her public appeal . So MGM teamed Crawford with Gable in Love on the Run . But their famed chemistry which always meant box-office returns in their previous five films , dissolved
zone2	received it was becoming clear that it was Crawford who was slipping . In another attempt to boost her public appeal MGM starred her opposite her real-life husband , Franchot Tone in The Bride Wore Red , where they played faithful lovers though their actual marriage was an open one . I was about 1 4 . He was very much a ladies ' man . And he would keep getting telephone calls ... ... onCrawford'stelephone in her dressing room ... ... fromladiesthathewasgoing with . She apparently permitted this ... ... andhewouldpickupthephone and have his conversation . She would read whatever she was reading or talk to me . He would finish . They would nod again , and he 'd go back to his dressing room . I did n't really know what was going on , so I did n't know how funny it was . Though her second marriage was on shaky ground Crawford 's relationship with the technical crew at MGM was one of her most cherished . The grips , the electricians , all of them , she knew them by name . And when
zone2	... ... **29;3111;TOOLONG . She knew that these people sustained her career and made her look good . A gaffer , he fell and the spotlight fell on top of him . Like , you know , 30 feet . And he was rushed to the hospital and she immediately stopped shooting . Every day that I was on the set ... ... shewasphoning or sending someone with gifts ... ... andmakingcertain that he was provided for . Mannequin was Crawford 's next and last picture for Joe Mankiewicz . But their shop-girl-who-makes-good formula had lost its audience appeal . The film ' s highlight would be her work with costar Spencer Tracy . Like Gable , Tracy was a man ' s man . He enjoyed playing the sport of polo , a staple for the male elite in Hollywood . Joan took a sudden interest in polo , although terrified of horses . Tracy helped her overcome her fears , and an affair began . But the actor was bound to a Catholic marriage and wanted no complications in his turbulent life . She could n't control him
zone2	with principal photography and Mannequin flopped at the box office . In 1938 , a trade paper ran an article entitled " Box-Office Poison . " It claimed theater owners were losing money with films starring Greta Garbo Joan Crawford , Marlene Dietrich and others . Crawford did not take the attack lightly . In only a year , she had fallen from being Hollywood 's " Queen of the Movies " to " Box-Office Poison " and the term of her seven-year contract at Metro was soon to expire . Louis B . Mayer was grooming a new crop of stars at MGM and Joan knew that the competition was gaining on her . The studio head used " Box-Office Poison " to his advantage and offered her a mere one-year contract . In fear of leaving the security of the studio she was willing to cut her price per picture in exchange for a longer contract at a lower salary . She signed a new five-year agreement and offered Mayer the advice : " No more goddamn shop girls . " With newfound enthusiasm , Crawford aggressively sought
zone2	The Women . Louis B . Mayer said , " Why would you want to play this awful bitch ? " She said , " I 'd play Wally Beery 's grandmother if the part was good . " And you think she would . After much pleading with director George Cukor she won the part opposite her MGM rival , Norma Shearer . He had created quite a stir on the MGM lot ... ... becauseherewas " The Queen of MGM " ... ... and " TheDancingGirl , " together in the same picture . And they knew that there might be some skyrockets going off . Joan had not appeared in a film with Shearer since she had doubled for her in 1925 . And after 1 4 years of accepting Norma ' s rejected roles and suffering her airs of condescension -- Oh , no , Stephen . I could n't think of your disarranging your evening . - Crawford had an arsenal of rage , and now a vehicle to vent it . So help me , I 'm gon na slug you . I only
zone2	I would n't have wanted to be in the rest of them . That was a catfight all the way . George Cukor was aware of the rift between Joan and Norma and skillfully kept the two apart until the very last minute . People were expected to do off-stage lines . When they 're playing scenes together , they intercut . - I beg your pardon . - I am Mrs . Stephen Haines . And then each one , in turn , respects the other and does off-stage lines ... ... withtheotheractress . And Joan , just to be spiteful ... ... keptknittingallthe time and never having to look at it . But you could hear the click of the needles ... ... **32;3142;TOOLONG . And put all the antagonism into it and contempt ... ... anda sortof aone-upsmanship over Norma . When it came time for Joan 's close-up ... ... Normawouldn'tcomeout of her dressing room . When Crawford and Shearer were called to shoot publicity stills neither one would enter the session first , so both circled the parking lot until Cukor pulled them from their
zone2	of friends . Say , listen . I 've worked too hard to land this meal ticket to make any false moves now . Romance ? Listen , peace is a whole lot more to me than any romance . They 're not gon na get me out on that limb again , ever . She is the villainess , and yet I find oddly sympathetic at the end of the picture ... ... whenshe'sbeendefeated by all these cats . Her exit is really rather touching . Well , girls . Looks like it 's back to the perfume counter for me . And by the way , there 's a name for you ladies ... ... **27;3176;TOOLONG ... ... outsideofakennel . Solong , ladies . The Women was an instant hit , and a new Joan Crawford emerged that of the legitimate actress . She was a total , technical , consummate artist ... ... **26;3205;TOOLONG to come through too . When she showed up in the morning , she knew her lines . And she knew your lines . And she knew his lines , and she knew
zone2	know yours . She understood cutting . She knew where the camera was . She knew what the best angles for her were . She was so experienced you did n't have to worry about her hitting her marks . She somehow or other could step in and feel the light right on her . The heat from the lamp was better there . When it was her close-up , she gave the performance that she was there to do . When it came around to close-up on you ... ... shestoodrightnext to the camera ... ... andshegaveexactly the same performance ... ... thatshedidwhen it was her close-up ... ... includingexactly when the tear came out . She said , " You want tears ? " And he turned to the director and said , " Of course , she 's - - " " Which eye ? " Which eye ? You got ta give her credit . Now , I do n't know how she did that . Joan never got bored with being praised . Franchot said , " I had to say , ' How gorgeous
zone2	" He had his own ego to be concerned with . He could n't always be placating hers . I think she just got bored with the marriage , and he just got tired . The Tone marriage was at the breaking point . After her last in a series of miscarriages Joan was informed by doctors that she was physically unable to have children . When Louella Parsons contacted Joan , suggesting a scoop about their affairs Joan suggested a better story . She said , " I 'm divorcing Franchot . " In March of 1939 , she signed the divorce decree on the grounds of mental anguish with her eye on the creation of a new and exciting Joan Crawford . Joan Crawford wanted to be a mother . She applied to social services ... ... tobean adoptiveparent , but they turned her down . Psychologically , they saw that she was an unfit candidate , as a single parent ... ... toadoptachild . So she used a baby broker in Las Vegas . We were bought . There 's no other way to say it .
zone2	thank heavens , I did n't stay that . - Hello , Julie . - Go away , Pig . Having achieved motherhood , Joan went back to work with Clark Gable in his first film since Gone With the Wind the action-drama Strange Cargo . The only woman in the cast , Crawford roughed out the location conditions and delivered one of her toughest performances . But the hardest blow came when she lost top billing to Clark Gable . Joan put up a fight but soon gave in to get the front office to give her better roles . A Woman ' s Face marked a transition for Joan . Here was maybe the most glamorous woman in Hollywood ... ... whowasplaying this scarred woman . You can tell that she 's just been starved for some kind of meaty role . Cukor was determined to edit down whatever mannerisms ... ... shehadaccumulated during that decade . And there 's a wonderful scene in the film when she has to finally tell ... ... howshegother scar , youknow . What is , you know , her story .
zone2	... takeaftertakeaftertake ... ... **30;3233;TOOLONG . And it 's very effective . She did do a good job in it , but it was a bomb at the box office . This is not the Joan Crawford that people wanted to see . MGM made no effort to get Joan an Oscar nomination . That was very disturbing for her . A whirlwind romance bloomed for Joan with B-movie actor Phillip Terry . On July the 2 1st , 1942 , they were married and soon adopted a son , naming him Phillip , Jr . He was the only father that I knew when I was a little girl . I did not meet him until they were married . Joan was cast in When Ladies Meet , a film so inauspicious that she saw the writing on the wall . The studio was beginning to gently nudge her out as it had with her female contemporaries Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo . Joan Crawford 's days at MGM were numbered . I think that Joan felt this coming on . The pictures they were throwing at her were
zone2	the top leading men that she used to get . She must have known that they were n't gon na keep her much longer . But that would n't stop Joan . She was career-driven . After 1 8 years at the studio Joan Crawford asked L.B . Mayer to release her from her MGM contract . And to her dismay , he accepted . That was a very sad experience in Joan 's life . I mean , this had been her home her whole life . And then to drive out of the studio on her last day ... ... withnobodybutthe gatemansaying goodbye , that was a terrific blow . She was devastated losing the MGM contract . The house had to be closed up . She did n't work for almost three years . And it was during the Second World War ... ... **30;3265;TOOLONG every week to entertain the troops ... ... pourcoffee , do autographs . We cooked off a Sterno stove in the basement .

We were never comfortable or relaxed , except when she was n't there . " Mommie Dearest " was supposed to be a term of maximum endearment ... ... butitendedupbeing the terminology of our enslavement . We very often said , " Yes , Mommie Dearest " ... ... insteadof , " Yes , MommieDearest . " Me particularly , I got in trouble for the tone of my voice . Jack Warner saw that there was some life left in Joan Crawford 's career . He had another motive too . Bette Davis was a pain in the Warner butt . He thought Crawford would be an ideal opponent ... ... withwhomhe couldwork one against the other . But the studio chief encountered headaches with Crawford as well who stalled for two years , knowing a flop could end her career in pictures . Joan had turned down dozens of films when she discovered a studio property that had been in development for years
zone2	Rosalind Russell too . But Crawford felt it was the perfect vehicle for her . Warner Bros . assigned director Michael Curtiz to the project although he was skeptical about Crawford . - My third no is final . - Yes , sir . But after Joan submitted to a screen test the director was won over . First time I visited her on a set was Mildred Pierce . She did n't know how her public would react . She was more mature now than when she was playing romantic leads at MGM . So it was a real change for her , and she did n't know what was gon na happen . I took that job so you and your sister could eat , sleep and have clothes . Are n't the pies bad enough ? Did you have to degrade us ? - Do n't talk like that ! - I 'm not surprised . You 've never spoken of your people , who you came from ... ... soperhapsit ' snatural . Maybe that 's why Father -- I 'm sorry I did that .

There 's nothing you can do about it . Oscar night was a well-rehearsed drama . She wants desperately to win the award and does n't know what to do .

zone2	There was n't much there that was really very substantial , and it ended . She ripped out all the photographs with him . So there were photographs that had big tears in them . Or in some cases , she just ripped off his head . Crawford seemed very , very smart about shaping a career . She knew it would serve her well to be seen with Garfield ... ... whowasat thepeak of his success then . I 'm a very difficult person to insult , Mr ... . You do have a name , do n't you ? Mrs . Wright , this is my friend , Paul Boray . And I 'm sure that any friend of mine is not welcome here . Bad manners , Mr . Boray . The infallible sign of talent . Soon the world will divide itself into two camps . Pro-Boray and anti-Boray . Which camp are you in , Mrs . Wright ? Pro or anti ? But like her character in the film Joan ' s drinking was becoming unmanageable . My mother and I used to go

How much it impacted her actual ability to work ... ... Ididn'tseeuntillater , but the impact was at home . They used to have little harnesses for cribs ... ... sothatbabiescouldn'tfall out . She had them all modified so that they were like torture devices . It was a means of saying , " I am the one in control . " My poor brother was constrained to that every single night . Joan was a very tough taskmaster . She was abused herself as a child . And very often , abused children turn out to be abusive parents . Wire hangers , wire hangers , wire hangers . The actual incident of the wire hangers was part ... ... ofa seriesof incidents that we used to call " night raids .

I explained it to you , how important it was for you not to leave me again . I do n't think you 're that good a shot . - You ca n't stop me . - Oh , yes , I can . Let me go . I 'm going to tell him . Possessed afforded Crawford the opportunity to play the sort of roles Bette Davis had monopolized at Warner Bros . In fact , the role was originally given to Davis who went on maternity leave and had to decline . Although Crawford 's career was on the upswing the same could not be said for Davis . There must have been something of a rivalry . By ' 46 , Davis
zone2	worse films . Crawford was still doing big movies there . That must have stuck in Davis ' craw . After Louella Parsons reported Bette 's was the most beautiful child on Earth Crawford arrived at the studio with not one but two brand-new infants . I think the record shows Joan Crawford was not the mother of the year . But she 'd also have these enormous birthday parties for them ... ... withmerry-go-rounds and pony rides . I think there was a human need there , too , that she wanted to be a mother . Joan returned to the screen the following year in another melodrama playing the sort of tough role that she was now famous for .

She was ready for me to take her on the floor ... ... oftheprojectionroom , for God 's sake . That began an affair that ran for over three years . She once said that 's the perfect woman .

When I got there , I found out that she had arranged ... ... forusto haveadjoiningrooms . But I was n't trying to parade it , you know what I mean . I wanted to keep the whole relationship quiet .

She said , " What could I say ? I do n't want you to sleep with Joan Crawford ? If I was a man , I think I would feel the same way . " My wife was a remarkable woman . Harriet Craig was about this woman that cared more for her house ... ... andthewaythingswere , than she did about her husband ... ... oranybodyelsearound . That was true , in many ways , of Joan .

Well , I once spent Christmas Day ... ... inJoanCrawford'shouse , and it was so funny . And her children waited until 1 : 00 in the afternoon to open their presents . They were like jittery beyond - - You ca n't imagine . She made them open their gifts one at a time . Then they had to go write it in a book . What it was , what they got . I mean , it was the most unspontaneous thing I 'd even seen . We did n't get to keep the presents ... ... andwegotlessandless as the years went on . I don ' t let them have all their presents at one time . From tomorrow on , they earn their gifts . If they stay on good behavior , they 're given their choice of what present they want
zone2	up something they really love . Otherwise , they don ' t really learn the value of giving . Christmas was just total torture . By 195 1 , Joan ' s last few films at Warner Bros . had failed at the box office . As a result , the studio began sending her substandard scripts in an effort to force her out for refusing work . The whole country is gunning for you . Such was the case with This Woman Is Dangerous a sordid melodrama , which she accepted while instructing her agent , Lew Wasserman to buy her out of her Warner Bros . contract . I came back . And I 'll never leave you again . Crawford departed Warner Bros . and joined other former studio contract stars who had gone independent . Her first vehicle was the suspense drama , Sudden Fear . - It 's the will . - " Last will and testament of Myra Hudson-Blaine . " Here it is . " To my husband , Lester Blaine , on my death , $ 1 0,000 a year . "
zone2	this . " Until he remarries . " If that dirty double-crossing dame thinks that she -- Lester , she can ' t sign it till Monday . Suppose something happened to her between now and Monday . - Who ' d get her money ? - Lester Blaine . I 'd get it all . Why not ? - I have a gun . - Gun ' s no good . It 'll have to look like an accident . Joan wisely decided against taking her usual salary and instead took a 40 percent profit participation in the film . The decision paid handsomely when the film became a hit and she was nominated a third time for a Best Actress Academy Award . Joan Crawford was disturbed by the changes going on in Hollywood where she felt a new openness about sexuality was running rampant . It was the Photoplay Awards dinner . Marilyn Monroe came in an hour late ... ... inthisgoldlam ? gown that she had been sewn into . The whole joint went mad . For Joan to be upstaged like that ... ... wasunforgivable
zone2	. I 've always been very subtle about that . " That created a front-page story . And Joan went to Louella Parsons and cried : " Of course I said those things , but I thought they were off the record . " When MGM beckoned Joan to return in the Technicolor musical Torch Song she was thrilled . The studio ' s publicity department treated Crawford 's return like a major event , with a " Welcome Back , Joan " banner and red carpet laid from the street to Joan ' s dressing room . However , the film ' s budget and shooting schedule were less than stellar . Torch Song was a B picture . Yet it was a job . She could show off her body , which was still pretty good . It was directed by Chuck Walters , and he told me he went to Joan 's house ... ... andshewaswearingakimono . And her first words were , " This is what you 're getting . " And she opened the kimono , and she was stark naked . That 's our
zone2	office . But Joan ' s survival instincts were relentless . And she would try any genre possible to refresh her public image including a western , Johnny Guitar . Someone described it as Beauty and the Beast with Sterling Hayden as Beauty . It was interesting to watch Joan and Mercedes McCambridge ... ... whokindof hadarivalrygoing . They had a big blowout . It was not a very pleasant set . When one scene involving McCambridge ... ... elicited applause from the cast and crew director , Nicholas Ray , gazed over his shoulder to see Crawford shaking with fury . She just snapped one day and took Mercedes ' costumes ... ... andthrewthemout intothestreet . - I 'm going to kill you . - lf I do n't kill you first . The director had to go and fetch them back . It was one of the major feuds in postwar Hollywood history . Mercedes , many years later , discussed the fact that she had been an alcoholic . And I think maybe that might have affected her attitude on the film . By the mid '
zone2	a haven for Joan , gave way to scandal sheets that exposed the sordid details of movie stars ' personal lives . I was being interviewed by the editor of one of the fan magazines . One of the assistant editors came in and said : " You wanted me to do that story on Joan Crawford . What do you want ? Nice girl or a bitch ? " And he said , " Make her a bitch . " So later when I was visiting with Joan , I told her about that . And I said , " How do you handle that ? " And she looked at me and smiled , and she said " Oh , my dear . Suppose they never wrote about me at all . " But it was Crawford 's relationship with her fans that proved to be the most enduring joy in her life . She was always so grateful to her fans . She felt she owed them to always look her best ... ... andtobe what they wanted her to be . She talked about fan mail

If we went to the theater , she kept giving autographs ... ... untilshegotthe lastonedone . She knew the public created her as a star . So she felt this great commitment to them and to never disappoint them ... ... toalwaysbe JoanCrawford whenever she was seen in public . The fans were more loyal to her than any man would have been ... ... orultimatelyanychild . She loved publicity . She knew , unlike most of today 's stars ... ... thatpublicity was part of her career . When you look into her upbringing of the children ... ... andtheway she used them for publicity ... ... itwasjustanotheradjunct of her career . - Good night , Mother . - Good night , Mother dearest . Good night , darlings . This is our best time . The best time for all mothers and children . The moment of wonderful peace and contentment knowing your children are all cozy in bed for the night .

I feel sorry for any child that grows up with a parent who is an actor . We are strange . We do come from another place . As each of her roles became more steely and harsh on-screen so did her appearance off the screen . And Crawford detested this change . If you look at her face on the screen ... ... therewasatoughness that never went away again . The look is really rather terrifying ... ... withthesehugeeyebrows and the teeth getting bigger ... ... likemaybeshehad themrecapped . The thick mouth line ... ... andtheshortcroppedhair .

She was like a mother fluttering around a child . I thought , " How nice she 's being to this young actress . " That changed when we started doing the movie . Poor Lucy would just weep : " She 's just so angry . When she hits me , she really hits me . " Maybe Joan was impatient ... ... thattherewasn'tthe talentthere that she expected . Joan pretty much directed herself . She , of course , would look at the dailies every day . So she knew what she wanted . She certainly knew more about filmmaking than the director . She usually had affairs with the men she worked with . She and Johnny were having this big romance . They 'd call in the morning about 7:00 , and they 'd say , you know : " Get yourself over here .

You and Johnny , " I said , " I thought that was a big romance . " She said , " We were in our cups a little bit , I have to admit . " And he said , " Why do n't we just get married ?

With the death of her fourth husband , Alfred Steele Joan was plunged into personal and financial despair . At the age of 53 , Crawford knew she had to find work in Hollywood .

And I came over to her and I said , " You 're gon na do a great job . " And then she got herself all propped up and got courage and did the scene . And then she looked for me after to see if I had seen it . It was a nice gesture on her part to make me feel like I was important . Next , Crawford embarked on a film that would once again galvanize her career . When Hollywood learned that Bette Davis and Joan Crawford ... ... weregonnacostar in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane ? ... ... everybodywasshocked . I mean , here are two of the greatest stars . Academy Award winners , queens of their studios . The story was that Bob Aldrich should n't direct the picture ... ... itshouldbe ClydeBeatty , the famous lion tamer .

Bette fell on the floor , Joan fell on top of her ... ... andBettewent into the hospital for two days . Joan got up with the attitude of , " Well , that was done . " She envied Davis .

She was in the wings and so was Bette . The presenter said , " The winner is Anne Bancroft in The Miracle Worker . " Joan had been designated to accept the award for Anne Bancroft ... ... whowasin NewYork . Joan pushed Bette and said : " Step aside , " and walked onto the stage . Bette never forgot that . Joan ' s next film was the psychological drama **29;3641;TOOLONG . The public wanted another horror film from Davis and Crawford and they were cast in , Hush ... Hush , SweetCharlotte . From the beginning , Bette was very crusty and aloof . She even installed a Coca-Cola machine on the set , instead of a Pepsi . She played such strong ladies in films . You 'd
zone2	she could not . Crawford went to a hospital and claimed she had pneumonia . And she stayed in the hospital for about three or four weeks . When I got to the hospital , she said , " I just wanted get out of the picture . " Bette had been talking to the director , cutting Crawford 's part down ... ... andbuildingherpartup . And she said , " I just did n't wan na be in , and go through ... ... **28;3672;TOOLONG . " And with that , she locked the door and we went to bed . Joan was replaced by Olivia de Havilland . That was the end of the costarring of the two great queens . Baby Jane was the last important picture Joan did . She did some horror pictures with Bill Castle . She became known as the scream queen . This is Joan Crawford . I urge you to see my new motion picture , Strait-Jacket , from the beginning . Strait-Jacket makes her look kind of like Mildred Pierce , but with a hatchet . I was hired to

Crawford 's suspense-horror films of the ' 60s are interesting ... ... becausesheis givingher all . She is approaching it as if it were still Mildred Pierce . It 's becoming a nightmare . I keep wondering and thinking , "

When people do show their vulnerability ... ... it'shardnottoforgivethem for other things . When I was visiting her , she opened this cupboard ... ... andinit wasaboxofCornFlakes ... ... anda jugandabowl . Her husband used to like Corn Flakes at night , and they were still there . She just missed him so much . She was lonely , she said she was . And I could see it , and I could feel it in her . Crawford 's identity was inextricably bound to stardom so she continued her career on television when film offers were scarce . Did Simon ever speak to you about the process he was working on ? Why , certainly . He kept me up night after night for weeks . I hope you can remember some of it . No . After five marriages , if a woman has n't ... ... well ,

She had , of course , very remarkable material to work with a quick , native intelligence , tremendous animal vitality a lovely figure , and above all , her face that extraordinary sculptural construction of lines and plains . It caught the light superbly , so that you could photograph her from any angle . The nearer the camera , the more tender and yielding she became . Her eyes glistening , her lips avid in static acceptance . The camera saw , I suspect a side of her that no flesh-and-blood lover ever saw .

How soon do you think you can reopen the mine ? Posthaste . The sooner the better . Good . Because I need to keep working if I do n't want to lose my ranch . I thought you were a miner . Well , I am a miner , but my father always dreamed of having a ranch for us one day . And ? He was killed in a cave-in when I was a boy . My mother , she moved us from mining camp to mining camp . They always need a woman to do the laundry and the cooking . I 've been without my cook for weeks . You always had everything , did n't you ? Several of everything .

They came up through the soft dirt . At least it ca n't penetrate rock . It has no eyes . How did they find us ? It 's the sound . Every time we made a sound . Even your teapot . That 's how they hunt . We ca n't just stay here . These foothills are made of rock . We can walk on them all the way to Rejection . - Walk ? - Well , unless you can fly . Tecopa , what are you doing ? Diggin ' a spot for a flagpole . A flagpole ? Does it concern you that Nevada has n't yet adopted a flag ? We will one day . I 'll be ready . They 're back !

When they 're not underground , they 're ... flying . Very fast . - Dragons . Dirt dragons . - We never had them in China . Big Horse , Juan - they tried to shoot them but could n't . You 'd have to be an unparalleled shootist . But wait , that 's it . A telegram . We must send a telegram immediately . Let me do it . I know how . Here . " Wanted - gunfighter . " " Town of Rejection , Nevada , seeks experienced quick-draw artist , calm in face of danger . " " Salary negotiable . " Send that to the Territorial Enterprise , the Denver Post and the Wichita Eagle . - You 're going to hire a gunfighter ? - I think that is a good idea . But is it wise ? A gunfighter 's usually mean
zone2	But we need someone with fortitude . - Someone with a little fan in their craw . Exactly . Someone who is proficient with firearms who can ... Shoot the nuts off a squirrel at a hundred paces . - Thank you . - Someone like Doc Holliday . - Except one that ai n't dead . - Doc Holliday 's dead ? OK , it 's done . Now we wait . - Handsome , no ? - Oh , very . It 's me . Very few men have statues of themselves . A cigar-store Indian ? Oh , a salesman gave that to me when he could n't pay his bill . Well , it could be me . - Mr . Gummer , I fixed your wheel . - Impossible , it 's a complete loss . Nope . Well , I ... My , my , that 's ... Remarkable . Um ... Thank you . Thank you very much .

May we barter instead ? For services rendered , you may have the bicycle . It 's yours . I 'm becoming quite the expert horseman . Dandy , Mr . Gummer ! There you go . No , um ... Oh , here , here , here , here . I 'll steady you . Get your balance . Now , when I push , press the pedals and keep the front wheel straight . Ready ? Off you go . Not bad . Not bad at all . How long is this bedlam to last ? Oh , a few more days . We 're deepening our well . We 're quite proud of our engine .

Lord , in any civilized place my name alone is quite sufficient . Well , out here in the rough-and-tumble West , we tend to use cash . That is a twenty-dollar gold piece on your watch fob , is n't it ? And the watch itself is gold , of course ? And the cufflinks ? Genuine diamonds ? Are you proposing that I barter with you as I would a street vendor in Calcutta ? Do n't be absurd . You will run a proper tab until this pathetic town has a proper bank to which I can wire funds . Here , now . What is going on ? Why are n't you riding that wheel ? No time . I 'm working . You men will take forever . Using a boy to do a man 's work ? Very narrow down there . He 's the only one small enough to widen
zone2	expect to see one of you down there in his place . And he back on that bicycle . Mrs . Lord , I should like to apologize . The truth is , my coin , watch and cufflinks are all I own in the world . I beg your pardon ? My father , in his final demented days , sold all his holdings and invested everything , the entire family fortune , in a certain silver mine . I see . I was rude earlier . I apologize . Once I get the mine running , I 'll pay my bill in full and be on the first stage out of here . As Old Fred would say , that 's a real gullywasher . Do n't look at me . I had nothing to do with it . I hope Old Fred made it to the muling station before this hit . Yesterday a desert , today a monsoon . Once I reopen the mine , the whole town will prosper . You 'll be able to afford whatever your hearts desire . And what is it
zone2	return to the life I had . To wake up every morning and wonder " What will I spend my money on today ? " I 'd venture it matters not how you spend your money , but how you spend your life . - Mr . Gummer ? - Do n't interrupt your elders . Never you mind , Miss Lord . I 'll amend my misspent life when the Grim Reaper comes calling . I recommend that you keep that hog leg skinned , unless you got a desire to be jumpin ' over hot coals in hell . And who might you be , sir ? - Kelly . - " Black Hand " Kelly ? I 'm lookin ' for Hiram Gummer . That would be me . - You posted yourself an advertisement ? - I did . Yes , I did . So who do you want me to kill ? That Injun over there ? No , no , no , no . It 's not so much a " who " as a " what " . They spring from the ground
zone2	call them " dirt dragons " . This stuff sure must be a whole lot stronger than it tastes . We 're well aware that it sounds fantastic , but we can assure you it 's all quite true . - They 're ferocious and fast . - It takes real backbone to face ' em down . Amigo , I like to fight with rattlesnakes just for the fun of it , and I give ' em first bite to boot . Hyperbole aside , you are accurate with a firearm ? - Questioning my abilities , sir ? - As an astute businessman , I 'm simply ... Hey , boy ! - Toss me one of them apples over here . - See , I knew it . Shoot inside house . - Throw it high ? - No , no , no . - You throw it right straight at me . - OK . - You ready ? - Anytime . - What ? - We thought you shoot apple . Obviously we were expecting to see a demonstration of ... You 're hired .
zone2	- In China , no one has gun . Before I sign up for anything , talk to me about that " salary negotiable " part . Do you like silver , Mr . Kelly ? I reckon I do . Upon dispatching all the aforementioned creatures , and upon the reopening of the mine , you 'll be paid in silver . Say , um ... as much as you can carry on a strong horse ? Well , now , I just bet that you could charm a cow right out of her calf with those fancy words . But now , for myself , I sorta need a little something up front . We do n't have any money . Ah , well . Thank you for your time . Double eagle . A down payment . Tell you what . You throw in them there cufflinks and , uh ... you got yourself a deal . This is one sorry collection of lead pushers you got here . I 'm not running a gun store , Mr . Kelly . Juan , you take this here
zone2	that feels right in your hand . And you give us all these blue whistlers that you got . Juan . - Take this . - Oh , pero no . I still ca n't afford it . No credit . It 's a gift . Gracias . What ? No one goes without a hat in China . OK , boys , let 's jingle some spurs . No . No . No spurs . In fact , no jingling of any kind . I tell you , these things are attracted by the slightest noise . They could leap from the ground at any moment . Juan killed one right here . Shh , shh , shh . Cu ? date , se ? or . There ai n't nothin ' here neither . Maybe they gone deaf . Or maybe you two boys are playing me for the fool . After what I paid you ? - We will just have to keep looking . - Juan , if you please , some help . Gummer , dag nab it , ai n't you got no pride
zone2	I ever again require horsemanship , I will engage a tutor . Well , I 'll tell you one thing . I ai n't got your book-learning , but I know this : Being full-growed do n't make you a man . Look , look , look , look . Here , here . They appear to be ... shells . Eggs . Well , if that 's what they are ... then they came out of one big chicken . Or maybe you two are n't as crazy as I 've been thinking . This is where we pipe the hot spring from the mine . The water cut through the dirt , you see ? And the eggs fell out . Perhaps the warm water hatched them . Juan , this tells us how many there are . There are four . And I killed one already . - Three left . - But where could they have gone ? Well , we 're just gon na keep on ridin ' till we find them , cos I 'm gettin ' awful anxious to unravel me some cartridges
zone2	ago . Then those creatures grew large quite quickly . That 's a part of one of them . These scaly things were on their backs . Yeah ? Well ... Maybe one of them there " things " died . Or maybe ... maybe he shed his skin , like a snake . Who is that ? It 's Old Fred . At least , that 's his wagon . Good Lord . This does not bode well . Now , that is one catawampussly chawed-up rig . As I keep say ... saying , these things are not to be trifled with . Old Fred ? Old Fred ? Old Fred ? Maybe we should have made it longer . Well , I 'm not toting ' no more rocks . - We should say something . - I did n't even know the man . Take off your hat . Fred was an old man . That is why we called him Old Fred . He drove the freight . He had bad breath . But I do n't want to say that . All right .

Let 's make camp here . - No , we 'll go to the ridge . Camp on solid rock . As we have every night . Oh , no . That is three miles back there . That 's hard country . If you think I 'd risk sleeping on the naked earth ... We could go down to the muling station . Down the canyon . - Is it safe ? - Yes . There are thick beams on the floor for the wagons . The dragons ca n't break through . - Might there be someone here ? - No . They stopped the supply wagons now that ... Now that the mine is closed . The bitter refrain of my life , it seems . We must secure these horses with certainty . The last time , they got
zone2	up tight . Mr . Kelly ! You ca n't see the door if you 're facing this direction . Always be prepared . Aaargh ! ? S ? lvame , Dios ! What in God 's name ? - So was that them ? - No . No . Something new . You said to pick one I was comfortable with . You 're right . I did say that . What in Sam Hill is that smell ? It 's them . That 's the smell . Remember , se ? or ? But they 've changed so . Become long and thin . There 's six of them , or even nine . We 'd better bring the horses inside . ? Chingada ! They 're gone ! Again ! We ca n't go on foot . They 'll get us for sure . All right . All right . That means we have to stand our ground here . Hiram , it 's about time you learned how to use a real piece . That 's your job . If I need a gun fired ,
zone2	down with a real pretty woman , I s'pose you just hire somebody to do that too . Spare me your tiresome analogies . Hiram . Now , I said this once , and I 'm gon na say it one more time . There are some things a man has to do for himself , and right now shooting ' is one . And give me that stupid hideout piece . It ai n't gon na do you no good now . OK , Juan , you keep your eye peeled for them there snake things . Pay attention , Hiram . Now , this is a single-action Colt Army . This is the finest wheel gun ever made . Do n't be holdin ' it like it 's some skunk . Now , it 's an extension of your hand , OK ? It 's part of you . - And take a stance , like you mean it . - Mean what ? Like you mean that every last lead plum that comes out of that barrel is gon na kill whatever you aim at . OK
zone2	over there by the window . You line up this blade with this notch then you just squeeze the trigger . You do n't jerk it . It 's all right . They can not break through the floor beams . Now , you just relax , you just let your eyes , your brain , your hand , your trigger finger , all becomes one . It 's all right . You got consistency now . - This is a waste of time ! - What do you expect ? You wan na learn in 20 minutes what took me 20 years ? They can not break through the floor , so they are tearing it apart . How could a snake be so strong ? - Look at that . They decoyed us . - Good Lord . How smart are they ? Est ? malo . We 're gon na have nothing left to stand on . - Telegraph ? - It is no good for us . - We do n't know the clicking code . - Click anything . Someone will hear us . I

This is from the muling station . It must be Mr . Gummer . He 's the only one out there . - When will Tecopa and Pyong be back ? - One , two days . Gone upcountry . Getting firewood . All right then . I 'll go myself . Must you tap so loudly ? Let your lead fly , man ! What the hell are we up against ? They ... they grew . Those snakes are not snakes . They are tongues . Three tongues ! - Each creature has three tongues . - And we saw nine before . - So there 's still only three animals . - That 's supposed to make me feel

And then ... and then we 're gon na go toe to toe , point blank , full bore , throw all the lead we got at ' em . And then maybe we 'll get a ... a lucky hit .

I 'm out !

Yes , they are following us . Faster ! - They 're at their limit . Hyah ! Come on ! - We shall see . They 're enormous . Ravenous . " Spirit demons from dark places , eating souls that live in the light . " Part of our legend . We put bullet after bullet into them . It did n't even slow them down . Will they come here ? To our town ? They 'd have to get through the pass . Lots of rocks . Maybe they can not do it . It hardly matters . The mine will remain unapproachable . So what is your intention ? My intention is to leave this godforsaken place , as should all of you . But the mine ... Are you listening ? The mine is lost .
zone2	if it never existed . Start your lives over , just as I will have to . No stupid animal is going to make me leave my land . I 'll go to Carson City , get some blasting powder . Juan , we were lucky . Dumb lucky . If a man like Black Hand Kelly is no match for them , what chance do we have ? Pyong , why would you stay ? Take Fu Yien and the missis back to China . Lu Wan forgets . China not perfect . No place perfect . We will not leave our new home . I 'll send for my belongings , and see that the horse and equipment are returned . That wo n't be necessary . You can keep the horse , and the saddle and the rifle and the knife . In trade for ownership of the mine . - You ca n't be serious . - It 's the best offer you 're gon na get . When I reach Philadelphia , I intend to sell that mine for at least $50,000 . You will
zone2	detail the creatures plaguing the mine , and why it is unworkable . That 's blackmail . You would n't betray me like that . We voted . Four to one in favor of doing exactly that . At least one of you has some sense of ethics . I voted to drop you off a cliff . Stay with us , Hiram . Stay and fight . You 're wasting your lives . You can have the cursed mine . Whoa . Whoa . Mr . Gummer , please do n't leave us . Fu ... Fu Yien , I ca n't help you . ? Madre de Dios . Hyah ! Hyah ! We were wrong . They 're coming . The dirt dragons , they got through the upper valley pass . I do n't know when , but they are definitely coming . Maybe they not find us , keep going south . No , no , no , no . They hunt by sound . We are the only thing making noise between here and Carson City . What do the sticks say ? "

Funnier than a dancing bear , eh ? Here 's one they sent yesterday . " Giant worms have left upper valley . " - " May find town . " - May I ? " Need immediate help . " " Giant worms . " One ticket . Sir ? Your ticket ? I was thinkin ' I could make a sled for it . We could pull it behind the last wagon . There 's no room . Time to let it go . Juan , where will you go ? There is a new strike down near Tonopah . I 'm thinking of heading that way . Where will we go ? - We are going to San Francisco . - And then back to China . All our money is put in the store , and now it 's all gone
zone2	railroad like momma and poppa . They 're coming ! No , no , no , no . Wait , wait . They will come from the north , not from the south . That is something else ... or someone . What poor soul would be coming here now ? It 's Mr . Gummer ! Come on ! Whoa ! " A ferocious arrival " ? Well , now , maybe I 'll let you keep him after all . Stop ! Whoa , curse you ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa , you intransigent beasts ! - Delighted to see you 're all well . - Hiram , they could be here any minute ! - I know . - Whatever are you thinking ? That this idyllic Western retreat shall not fall prey to these mindless predators . I have a cache of weapons that would impress even the late Black Hand Kelly . One Sharps.52-calibre buffalo rifle . One Remington 45-120 Rolling Block . One Henry repeating rifle . Smaller caliber , but impressive rate of fire . One eight-gauge Remington ... um ... derringer
zone2	And this . A two-inch-bore punt gun . Hiram , how did you get all of these things ? You do n't have any money . A wise friend once told me it 's not important how you spend your money , but how you spend your life . Hiram Gummer , what is it you think we are going to do ? Hm ? Madam , I intend we throw our visitors a little corpse-and-cartridge occasion . That we stand our ground and fight these despicable beasts to the death ! We will fight ! Right . It takes me two years to make you leave China . You think I want to go back ? - We do it . - We 'll stomp ' em like snakes . - We will burn them down . - We 'll smoke ' em up ! Ah , Juan . Knowing you , you 'll need a spare . Gracias , amigo . They 'll probably be coming from the north or the northeast . Then we go out there and shoot them . Too dangerous . They can come
zone2	terms . - Stake a horse . When they go for it ... - Tecopa , that 's cruel . Well , these are cruel times . Ca n't we make noise with something else ? That is a good idea , Fuito . Any noise works . It does n't have to be a horse . We could make noise on something like this . Then when they come up , we shoot them . Yes , an ambush . We will lead them into our very gun muzzles . We will make Rejection our last bastion , our last line of defense . - Our Alamo . - Juan , we were the losers at the Alamo . Speak for yourself , gringo . More cans . I need more cans . I 'm eating as fast as I can . What is all this ? When they come , how do we know they come ? We can not see them . - Well , that is a concern . - When the ground shakes ... we know they are here . Dandy . What is a
zone2	A great many ducks . " Pour in one pound of shot or balls . Ram it down tight ... " Yup ! Hyah ! Wo n't we need the horses ? I mean , if we lose the fight ? Ca n't have them making unnecessary noise . Might spoil our trap . And we 're not going to lose , Fuito . Shall we begin ? Maybe we should try again tomorrow . Perhaps Pyong was right . Perhaps they 've bypassed us for Carson City . I do n't know . The ridge at the south end of the valley is all rock , like a big wall . - I do n't think they can get past it . - They got ta be somewhere . No ! Fu , get inside ! - But I want to fight too ! - Fu , Fu . The store is our fort . We ca n't ever leave the fort unguarded . You stay inside and keep guard . You missed ! With a cannon ! - Where did it go ? - Maybe the noise scared
zone2	! It 's coming back ! Hiram , quick ! Yeah ! It worked ! Ugh ! It stinks ! - There ! - Two more to go ! Take your positions ! Fu Yien , back inside ! Juan ! Did it do that on purpose ? Juan , look out ! Can not shoot through dirt . Hyah ! Hah ! Come on , you son of a bitch ! ? Ay , caramba ! Tecopa , gracias . Aston ... Astonishingly clever , my man . - It take your gun . Did it know ? - I fear they are very intelligent . - But not as smart as us . - No . Not as smart as us . And there 's only one left . Where the hell is it ? Let it show itself ! Tecopa ... - Is it leaving ? - No . No , it 's circling . Listening for prey . What do we do ? It seems our rifles are n't strong enough to kill it . Without the punt gun , I fear we 're lost .
zone2	up ? Maybe we take traction engine . Try to get away . - It moves so slowly . - And you would leave our town ? You have ideas for killing it ? A man must learn to sail in all winds . We must do what we can with what we have . Well said . You have black powder . Maybe we could blow it up somehow . Sure . We make big firecracker . I know how . Excellent - but quietly . Move very , very slowly . Fu Yien , you go inside and get twine for fuse . OK . - What are you doing ? - Powder for the fuse must be very fine . Almost there . Just another few minutes . Fu ... Fu ! - I ca n't see the door . - Fu , stay very quiet . Make noise ! Out here ! Hey ! Why does n't it come for us ? For the noise ? I do n't know . They keep learning our every trick . He 's over here . Fu ! Good
zone2	! In the wagon ! Get on . - Oh , good Lord ! - Let 's get the rifles . The bomb ! - Pyong , you must finish the bomb . - I need more time ! We 'll never have time to finish that ! I have an idea . ? Hijo de puta ! Pyong , that big belt . Excellent , excellent . Tecopa ! Help us here ! - What we need is some kind of hook . - I know where . Over here , Juan ! Go . Go ! Watch out ! Yes ! - Mrs . Lord , are you well ? - Yes . Are you all right ? Yes , I am . Gracias , amiguito . - You got ' em , Mr . Gummer . - Yes , Hiram . You got ' em . No , no . We got ' em . Well done , well done . Hiram ! The bank has approved your loan . You can hire new workers , reopen the mine . Well , if I recall , it
zone2	Hiram . It 's your mine . We could n't cheat you that way . You need it worse than we do . That 's very kind . But I 'll only assume ownership under two conditions . " Conditions " ? We agree never to tell anyone about the dirt dragons . If word of them ever got out , no one would ever settle here . And the second condition ? That the first proceeds of the mine are used to build a hotel and a market with real walls , to pay off Juan 's land , and , uh ... Tecopa , what do you want ? A new statue . One that looks like me . And to commission a statue for Tecopa . Does everyone agree to this ? I am fearfully outclassed . It 's good you 've decided to stay . I shall personally supervise the mine - I mean , as soon as I learn how it all works . And I 've selected an excellent location for my home . On high ground . Readily defended . It will even

zone2	. I 'm sorry . I should have told you we were coming , obviously . Anyway , here we are . Hello , I 'm the mother . Harry Sanborn . How are you ? God , sorry . This is my friend , Harry . My mom , Erica . My aunt , Zoe . Sorry about that . We spur-of-the-moment decided to get out of the city for a couple of days . That 's good . Honey , does Harry have a robe ? You know what ? I think I should just take off , let you gals enjoy your weekend ... . What ? No , I 'm sorry . Do n't do that . That 's silly . Zoe and I will leave . You and Harry stay . Harry , I 'm sorry . I apologize about the near-arrest . You were very impressive . Very strong . Very macho . I do n't think I was exactly macho . Trust me . lf l ever catch a guy in his underwear in my refrigerator ... I hope I 'm half the
zone2	. Whatever . All right , then , I 'm definitely gon na hit the road . Ladies , sensational meeting you . Doll , give me a call . Hold on , let 's not get so dramatic here . What are we , four teenagers ? We 're sophisticated people . Why do n't we all just stay for the weekend ? Erica has work to do , I have papers to grade . You 'll do your thing , whatever that may be ... and if we wan na hang out together , we will . lf we do n't , we do n't . No reason we should all give up this spectacular weekend . Seriously ! I can handle it . I can totally handle it . I can handle it . - Hello , Mrs . Barry . - Hello , Annie . I would like a slice of your wonderful meat spread ... and a piece of your best goat cheese . Impressive . She started taking French lessons after she and my dad split up . Part of her " keep busy
zone2	's practically fluent . - Should I get some dessert ? - Let 's buy something . Should we get a good chocolate cake ? - Not bad . - Yeah , I am fluent . I 'll be right back . It 's an epidemic . Buy some things . - How about pasta salad ? - We had that last night . - We did ? I do n't remember . - Yeah . Thank you , madame . Thank you . Sorry . Sorry about that . - My fault . - No , it 's fine . So , Harry , what do you do ? I 'm one of the owners of a record company , among other things . - Really ? Which record company ? - Drive-By Records . Drive-By Records ? is that a joke ? What is that ? It 's a hip-hop label . Hip-hop ? Rap , right . That 's interesting . Let me see if I get where you 're headed here . I 'm sorry . But look , I hate rap , I really do
zone2	, not to mention just a tad misogynistic . Some people see rap as poetry . Yeah , but how many words can you rhyme with " bitch " ? Next , please . How are we doing ? Should have left when she tried to arrest me . Mom , how 's the new play ? Getting happy with it ? You know the thing about me . I 'm 90% hard work , 10% talent ... and so far , the talent part has n't exactly kicked in yet . Right . - What 's your play about ? - About ? I 'm not exactly sure , which is a bit of a problem . But so far , it 's about a divorced woman , a writer . She 's this high-strung , over-amped , controlling , know-it-all neurotic . Who 's incredibly cute and loveable . It 's a comedy . So how did you two meet ? At a wine auction at Christie 's . Harry was the big buyer of the night . I kept raising my paddle just to get her to
zone2	bought the entire collection . I mean , every known bottle of Chateau Margaux . After that , the least she could do was share a bottle with me . Ever been married , Harry ? No , I have n't . Why do you think that is ? Some people just do n't fit the mold , and so far ... . - lf it ai n't broke ... . - Exactly . Wait a second . Are n't you a famous bachelor ? I would n't say I 'm famous . Yeah , did n't I read an article about you in " New York Magazine ? " I guess some people find it interesting that I 've escaped the noose for so long . That was the title of the article , The Escape Artist . I 've read that article . That was you ? You were once engaged to someone really big . Who was it ? Joan Collins ? No . - Wait a minute . Carly Simon ? - Somebody cool like that . - Not Martha Stewart . - No , not
zone2	, this is more fun . lt 's like I 'm not here . Harry was once engaged to Diane Sawyer . - What ? - Right , Diane Sawyer . I love her . I 'm impressed . Yeah , women your age love that about me . - You know what I mean . - Yes , I do . It 's not a bad thing to say " women your age . " No , I 'm sure it was a compliment . It 's just an accurate observation . So when was this ? The engagement ? A long time ago . She was this adorable , lanky girl from Kentucky ... with the greatest pair of legs I have ever seen . I never understood her ending up on a job where she never showed them . You ca n't be serious . I mean , she 's Diane Sawyer . She goes into caves in Afghanistan with a " shmatteh " on her head . Who cares about her legs ? You know what , I hate to eat and run , but --
zone2	come on . This is really fascinating , what 's going on at this table . Zoe teaches Women 's Studies at Columbia . Okay , so this is gon na hurt . No . Let 's take you and Erica , for example . Harry , you 've been around the block a few times , right ? What are you , around 60 ? 63 . Fantastic . Never married , which , if you were a woman , would be a curse . You 'd be an old maid , a spinster . So instead of pitying you , they write articles about you . Celebrate your never marrying . You 're elusive and ungettable , a real catch . - Then there 's my gorgeous sister here . - No , wait . No , this is interesting . Look at her . She is so accomplished . The most successful female playwright since who ? Lillian Hellman ? She 's over 50 , divorced , and she sits in night after night ... because the available guys her age , forgive me for saying this
zone2	whole over-50 dating scene ... is geared towards men leaving older women out . As a result , the women become more productive ... and therefore , more interesting . Which in turn makes them even less desirable ... because men , especially older men , are threatened and deathly afraid ... of productive and interesting women . It is just so clear ! Single older women as a demographic are about as fucked a group as can ever exist . God ! What are you , possessed ? How could you say those things ? It seemed really obvious to me , the injustice of it . Our only break is that men die younger than us . Then you know what ? Write a dissertation on it . But do n't announce to the world that I stay in " night after night . " By the way , one " night after night " would have been enough . Did you ever realize that I stay in as part of my job ? And why do you think I married the director of my plays ? He
zone2	I like staying in and I like this time in my life . Why do I have to defend myself ? I was married for 20 years . I 'm done . What the hell was that ? I 'm sorry . I thought I was on to something . Honey , what are you doing with this guy ? He 's old . He 's chauvinistic . - He 's fun . - He 's fun ? How is he fun ? He 's wrong . - Yeah , wrong can be fun , Mom . - Not this wrong . He 's smart and fascinating . If you talk to him ... about something other than his marital status ... you would find out how smart he is . He owns 10 companies . What does that mean ? It means he ca n't commit , that 's what . Not that , God forbid , I want him to commit . Yeah , that I get . Anyway , he said he thought you two were very spontaneous and nice ... and then he said he 's
zone2	, his car does n't have headlights ? Wait a minute . I have no right to get this nuts . I 'm sorry . He 's your friend , he 's not mine . - l 'm sorry . I love you . - l love you more . - No chance in hell he said we were nice . - Please . None . - What are they listening to ? - l do n't care . Marvin Gaye ? Will you stop that ? That 's disgusting , Zoe . Stop it ! There . I know she 'll never see him after this weekend . She ca n't commit , either . He does sound fun . Admit it , he 's got something . You felt it , right ? This is nuts . Mom ! - Did she say " Mom " ? - Mom , hurry ! I do n't know what happened . We were fooling around . Then he said he felt funny and just collapsed . Harry , what is it ? - l 'm okay . I 'm fine
zone2	an elephant 's sitting on it . Call 91 1 , tell them to send an ambulance . Marin , now ! Oh , my God . - What are you doing ? - Mouth-to-mouth . You fucking guy ! We need an ambulance right away , please . 29 Daniels Lane , Sagaponack . Come on , Harry ! Look at me ! Nine , ten , eleven , twelve . - What have we got ? - Cardiac arrest . Sinus tach 120 . - B.P . ? - 150 over 95 . - Right here ? - On three . All right . Careful . We 've already got a line in . Switch over to monitors . How are we doing here ? He 's had 30 minutes of chest pains , nausea , shortness of breath . Pulse 104 , respiration 's 18 . Let 's get the CBC , CMP , cardiac panel , and 12-lead EKG . Mr . Sanborn , I 'm Dr . Mercer . Are you in any pain right now ? I feel some pressure in my chest .
zone2	where the pain is ? - Right here . What were you doing when the pain started ? I was kissing a beautiful woman . - Were you having intercourse ? - Unfortunately , no . - Sense of humor intact . - Yeah . Give him an aspirin , metoprolol , 5 mg , and hang a nitro drip . - Mr . Sanborn ? - Yeah . Your EKG shows you have a blocked artery ... which is not allowing enough oxygen to get to the heart muscle . I 'm having a heart attack ? We 're gon na stop it , but I need to know what medications you take . I take Lipitor . Chew this . - Anything else ? - And a white one for blood pressure . What about Viagra ? Mr . Sanborn , did you take any Viagra today ? No Viagra . Good , I just needed to be sure because I put nitroglycerin into your drip . And if you had taken Viagra , the combination could be fatal . - Your dad 's gon na be okay
zone2	sorry . Your granddad is gon na be okay . Thank you so much . We 're not related . - He 's a friend . - Sorry . I 'm Dr . Mercer . Mr . Sanborn did have a mild heart attack . I gave him something to dissolve the clot and it worked beautifully . He 's very lucky . Another half-hour , I do n't know if this would have worked . This was very intense . He 's doing great . I gave him something to help him sleep . It might make him a little loopy at first , but then it should knock him out . - You 're Mrs . Sanborn ? - No ! No , I 'm Erica Barry . He was having dinner at our house . I just met him this afternoon . - You 're Erica Barry . - Yes . - The playwright ? - Yes . What a pleasure . I 'm a huge fan . - Really ? - A huge fan . Thank you . Thanks . Thank you , Doctor . -
zone2	Thank you . - You 're welcome . May I ? - Yeah , sure . This is very sweet of you . In medical school you learn what can keep you up all night ... without making you nuts . You know , I heard you had a house in the Hamptons . I am a big fan . I think I 've seen every play you 've ever written . I think some were written before your time . There are some Marin 's never seen . I 'm pretty sure I 've seen them all . And I saw the last one twice . Julian , we 've got a walk-in , may need stitches . Okay , thanks . I 'll check on Mr . Sanborn . If he 's asleep , you all get some shut-eye and come back in the morning . Great to meet you , Erica . Ladies . Okay . Now that 's the perfect guy for you . He 's adorable . Mother , I have never seen a man less interested in me . Or more interested in you
zone2	- No , he 's older than that . Who cares how old he is ? He 's not my type : He 's a gorgeous , wholesome doctor . But he 's perfect for you and he 's hot for you . He 's really perfect . Okay , stop it . He likes my work , he does n't like me . I would never ... . Shut up . Oh , God . ls he all right ? Harry , over here . Hi , honey . I wan na go home . Can you call Leo ... - to pick me up ? - No , you 've got to get back into bed . Woman , you saved my life . - Get a nurse . - Nurse ! I thank you from the bottom of my ... . Even unconscious , he 's a lech ! Get off ! You should n't be standing . It 's all right . Thank you . I got ta take a whiz , girls . We 'll take care of that for you . Okay , I
zone2	. What can I do you for ? I 'm here to pick up Harry Sanborn . Hi , I 'm Dr . Mercer . Come on , I 'll take you to him . And you are ? I 'm Leo Hoffman . I 'm Harry 's personal assistant . Do a little chef , little driving , little party planning , whatever the man needs . Sounds like a pretty interesting job . Going on six years and never a dull moment . Okay , Harry , looks like we 're gon na have to let you go . Take it easy , kids . I just sat up a little too fast . Doc , tell them . Am I in good shape ? How were my tests this morning ? He 's doing extremely well . - Can I hug him ? - Absolutely . Let 's not get goofy . We got nothing but good news here . Knock , knock . - Hi . - Hey . - l 'll catch you on the way out . - Thanks a lot , Doc .
zone2	Mr . Excitement . Tell me something . We have n't actually had sex yet , have we ? No , we have n't . You 're correct on that one . Something to live for . Down to the cheek . Hold on , Tarzan , we 're still moving . Slowly . Harry , I 'm sorry , but I ca n't let you travel quite yet . I ai n't going back in there . I ca n't put you in a car and I ca n't leave you in the parking lot . I wo n't sue you , if that 's what you 're thinking . I 'll sign whatever you like . Just let me go back to the city . Here 's my best offer . I wo n't put you in the hospital if you stay nearby for a few days . Get a nurse and let me keep an eye on you until you get your strength back . Stay nearby . Doc , where do you suggest I go ? Somebody please explain to me how I ended up babysitting
zone2	've ever had in my life . - You 're not even listening to me . - l am . Do n't get all pissy . I come out here for peace and quiet ... and suddenly , I 'm a character in a Kaufman and Hart play . And the phone does n't stop . And it 's never for me . Sorry to interrupt . - No , that 's fine , Leo , I 'll take it . - No , that 's okay . I do n't mind washing them . - No . - Okay . How you doing ? The man does not know my name , and I 'm doing his dishes . I said I 'll take it back tomorrow , okay ? Great . I 'll take care of it . One second . Erica , where shall I put this ? Right here . I 'll take it . Harry has a really bad headache . Do you have any Tylenol ? Extra-strength would be fantastic . Hi ! I 'm Tania . - Hi . - Harry 's second
zone2	meet you . Thank you . Appreciate it . " What should I do with this ? " It 's an empty water glass . What are the choices ? Okay , I 'm getting out of your hair . So you 're not ready to show me any new pages ? I 'm not putting any pressure on you . I 'm just asking . Dad ! I did n't know you were here . Just on my way out , " bubee . " I was gon na drive back to the city with Zoe , but I 'd rather go with you . Actually , I have someone to meet before I go . Wait . You 're leaving ? Zoe is leaving ? The entourage is leaving ? And I 'll be stuck here with him , alone ? The hospital is sending over a nurse in the morning . In the morning ? That 's 19 hours from now . Okay , I can handle this . I 'll just get myself into a Zen place . Play music , cook , write . Focus
zone2	lunch is a bit much for anybody . Hi . Can I call you right back , doll ? Thank you . - What 's up ? - Here 's the thing . I do n't want to play the part of the uptight nurse to your bad-boy patient . If you wan na have another heart attack , go ahead . But I have work , and no time to run to the hospital ... because you 're filling your already-clogged arteries with smoke . But more importantly ... I 'd rather not have my freshly painted house smell like a pool hall . Have you always been like this , or do I bring it out in you ? Just , you know ... . l do n't think I 've ever had this effect on a woman before . What effect ? I do n't quite recognize it . That 's how I know I never had it before . So , you do n't sleep ? I only need about four hours a night . Me , too . I never slept eight hours in my
zone2	. Do you want me to shut these ? The sun comes in pretty strong in the morning . Sure . Who were you talking to at this hour ? A friend in LA . lt 's only 10:00 on the Coast . And that 's not past her bedtime ? So you do n't get more mellow as the hours pass . Good night , Harry . Can I ask you one other thing ? What 's with the turtlenecks ? It 's the middle of summer . Seriously , why do you care what I wear ? Just curious . I 've always liked them , and I 'm just a turtleneck kind of gal . You never get hot ? No . Never ? Not lately . Finally . Oh , God ! I 'm sorry . God , am I sorry . - What are you doing ? - l was just trying to find the kitchen . Back here ? I got confused . lt was dark , and ... . l did n't really see anything . Just your tits and a little ...
zone2	're leaving ? No , that 's not good . - l 've been fired . - No , you just started . Not fired , darling . Just not needed . Not needed ? What are you talking about ? Of course she 's needed . We need her . No . I 'm actually feeling pretty perky today . Making quite a comeback . Sorry for your trouble , Mrs . Gimble . Take care , dear . You 've been wonderful . Listen , about last night -- How about we never talk about that , okay ? Anyway , I was at the drugstore . Your prescriptions were ready . They said to take these two with food , this one without . You were in silhouette . I think that 's talking about it . I really did n't see all that much . There you go . - Okay , I wo n't mention it again , but -- - Going to work . You saw my ass ... you do n't see me acting nuts and wearing glasses and hats ... and weird
zone2	? - Can I go ? - You still getting dizzy ? - Not as much . - Out of breath ? Only sometimes . - Good . How 's Erica treating you ? - Who ? Erica . Her . She is a major piece of work . Doc , the woman wears turtlenecks in the middle of the summer . She 's beyond uptight . Almost makes her fun to be around . Uptight ? That 's funny , I have n't noticed that . Try living with her . I actually saw her naked last night . - That does n't sound so uptight . - lt was an accident . She thought I was asleep , I thought her room was the kitchen . You know what Freud said . There are no accidents . Trust me , this was an accident . Although , why would she be walking around naked ... when she knows I 'm 20 feet away ? Why would you think her bedroom was the kitchen ? It was dark . lt was 2:00 in the morning . That could explain
zone2	You know , I 've never seen a woman that age naked before . You 're kidding . We 're not all doctors , baby . I think she 's very beautiful . And she 's a fantastic writer , you know . No , I do n't know . She 's pretty major . So you date her daughter ? Okay , now she 's a great chick . Must take after her father . Which reminds me ... what about Mr . Midnight here ? When can I be up and running in that department ? I think Mr . Midnight needs to stay put for another couple of weeks . But it wo n't kill me when I do it , right ? No , it 's exercise . lt 'll be good for you . After a heart attack , rule of thumb is : If you can climb a flight of stairs , you can have sex . So you 're saying he ca n't travel at all ? Not even by plane ? - Train ? - l do n't think so . Been
zone2	Now he says he does n't even need one . He 's a bit of a workout . How are you holding up ? - Me ? - You . I 'm fine . Fine . One more " fine " and I wo n't believe you . Wait , where 's my ... . There . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Hello ? Hi . No , I 'm sorry , I have n't been able to get back . Part of the play takes place in Paris ... so I keep listening to French music , hoping to get inspired . No , it 's not helping at all . I 'm trying . It 's not exactly flowing out of me yet , but ... . Pick you up around 7:00 ? What about the patient ? Like he said , he does n't need a nurse . I 'm walking around the house ! Oh , no . - Hi . - Listen . I 've decided to get over that whole " you saw me naked " thing . - So
zone2	- Good . Because I have been hiding from you all day . Do you wan na come in ? I do n't wan na break your rhythm or anything like that . That would be wishful thinking . Nice painting . I 'm gon na venture out there and go for a short walk . - You up to that ? - My doctor recommended it . I got to build up to climbing stairs and stuff like that . You would n't wan na join me ? That means you do n't want me to ? No . I was asking if you wanted to . Yeah , I would . But I do n't like to break once I start writing , so I should n't . I mean , not that a little fresh air would hurt . It 's just a walk , Erica . Not a marriage proposal . You know my name . Erica Jane Barry . I looked you up on the Internet . Do you know that there are over 8,000 web sites that mention you ? - That 's not
zone2	know everything about you now , and not because of last night . No , I understood . - Actually , I looked you up , too . - You did ? Yeah . I know you grew up in LA , which I thought nobody did . You started your own record label at 29 . Very impressive . Sold it at 40 , even more impressive . Then you started a magazine , dabbled in the Internet . And then you invested in a small record company ... which you turned into the second-largest hip-hop label in the world . - lt 's exhausting just hearing about it . - Yeah , I know ... but the truth is , it goes by fast , does n't it ? - Like the blink of an eye . - Yeah . Look at this . I notice that you have bowls of those all over your house . It 's so crazy , I know . But I just think they 're beautiful . But why do you only pick up the white one's ? I do n't pick
zone2	crazy . No , I only pick up the white one's . Oh , God . What does that mean ? That I 'm controlling ? Unadventurous ? What ? So you 're as hard on yourself as you are on everyone else . Something to remember me by . Can I ask you something ? Yeah , sure . Go ahead , shoot . What 's with all the young girls ? What 's the story there , really ? I just like to travel light . You just like to travel ... . God ! I 'm sorry , but what does that mean ? Now , see , a 30-year-old gets that . You mean falls for it . I mean accepts it . Acceptance is key . Okay , if that 's what you want . A non-threatening woman ... does n't get your number , you get to run the show . I think our relationship is growing , by the way . Have you noticed ? I 'm serious . Maybe we just need to get out of the house . Now , you
zone2	the house ... and it 's getting a little rocky again . Of course it 's getting rocky . We 're talking about you . See , I 'll accept that slight hostility ... because I 'm enjoying your company so much . Are you okay ? Yeah . But I think I 'll stay down here and watch the sun set . You interested ? Ringside seat . Big dinner date ? Yeah , as a matter of fact , with your doctor . My doctor . - Because he 's not too young for you ? - No . He 's totally too young for me . But we 're just having dinner , it 's not a date . Does he know that ? I 'm gon na tell him . But I doubt he thinks of it that way . Okay ? I doubt that you doubt it . Anyway , you may like it . Think of it this way : He 's non-threatening , wo n't get your number , you get to run the show . - That is so unfair . -
zone2	Look who 's answering the door . And look who 's at the door . I brought you something . A heart-healthy dinner from our cafeteria . Why , thank you . Hello . - You look beautiful . - Thank you . Hi , it 's Marin . I 'm not in right now , so leave a message and I 'll call you back . Hey , it 's me . Just sitting around , looking at your baby pictures . Thinking of you . You 've reached Brooke and Shannon . For Brooke , push one , for Shannon , push two . Everybody is out but old Har . Old . Old Har . Top of the heap . - Julian , can I ask you something ? - Anything . How old are you ? I 'm 36 . So I 'm almost 20 years older than you . Is n't that an enormous amount of years to be older than somebody ? I do n't think it matters at all . - You do n't ? - l do n't . Okay . But
zone2	be friends , right ? Honestly ? No . - So what do you wan na be ? - l think I 'd embarrass you if I told you . I was embarrassed just getting dressed to see you . This may surprise you , but some women consider me quite the guy . I 've never been married . I 'm a doctor . You would n't believe what catnip that is for some women . Yes , I would . Do n't you like girls your own age ? I do , but I 've never met one I 've reacted to ... quite like this . And when something happens to you that 's never happened to you before ... do n't you have to at least find out what it is ? I suppose . I do n't know . This is an area that 's tricky for me . See , I do n't really date all that much or all that well . Come on , you must beat them away with a stick . You 're kidding , right ? No . Men
zone2	met ... . l 'm not that regular a person , and they really like regular . Men your age may be really stupid . Did you ever think of that ? Yes , I have . Many times . I knew you 'd smell good . It 's just soap . - Erica ... - What ? - ... you 're incredibly sexy . - No . I swear to God I 'm not . I 'm back ! Have fun ? It was interesting . Good night , Harry . Night . Get rid of that . That 's good . Harry 37 ? Of course . Relentless . I do n't understand how he knows everything . In her pj 's . " Pajama party . " Oh , man . We are cute . This is pretty unusual for me . I 'm not used to having sleepovers . Me , either . Really ? With your social life ? My dear , you 're confusing sex with sleeping . Sleeping is something that I prefer to do alone . Okay . Good to know .
zone2	? I know you think I 'm not very discriminating when it comes to -- Please . What difference does it make what I think of you ? I ca n't even imagine what you think of me . Pancakes , pasta , leftover coq au vin . - Grilled cheese ? - Pancakes . Totally what I wanted . You ever miss being married ? I bet you were great at it . Sometimes . Yeah , at night . But not that much anymore . Was one of us just saying something interesting ? You said you ca n't imagine what I think of you . You do n't have to answer that . Okay . If you had an opinion , I 'd be curious . Will you tell me first why you only miss being married at night ? The phone does n't ring that much at night ... and the whole alone thing happens at night . Sleeping by myself took some getting used to , but I got the hang of it . You got ta sleep in the middle of the bed .
zone2	one has the other side . Now I 'm convinced that what I think about you is right . You 're a tower of strength . Try not to rate my answer . I 'm sorry , okay ? You know what you 're like ? You 're like one of those great portraits you see over a fireplace . Words have been invented to describe women like you . Such as ? Flinty . lmpervious . - So you think I 'm inhuman ? - No . I think you 're formidable . Cold , distant , like I 'm frozen in some painting ? Not at all . But I do think that you use your strength to separate yourself from everyone . But it 's thrilling when your defenses are down ... and you 're not isolated . That , I believe , is your winning combo . Killer combo , actually . You know , I ca n't decide if you hate me ... or if you 're the only person who ever really got me . I do n't hate you . - You do
zone2	Hi ! - Room service . Honey , what are you doing here at this hour ? I had this big benefit tonight . Then I went out with a bunch of friends and I checked my messages . And I got this so sad phone call from Harry . So bored out here , so I figured I should come up and see how you 're doing . Thank you so much for the gorgeous flowers , by the way . They 're so huge . It 's a pleasure . That is so sweet . You guys are making pancakes ? You 're both in your pj 's . I feel like I 'm interrupting . Do n't be silly . You know I never sleep . This one does n't sleep either . Hello ? No , I 'm here , babe . I made record time . is everybody still there ? Okay , bye . - Mar ? - Yeah ? Now that you 're here , why do n't you finish the pancakes ... and I 'll get back to work ? Mom ,
zone2	totally stood me up today . I was supposed to have lunch with him at Barney 's , and he never showed up . - Was he always like this ? - Honey , I do n't know . That 's what happens when a couple gets divorced . The kid inherits all the problems . Not that I 'm a kid . So how are you ? How are you feeling ? So tell me , when can you go home ? I really am gon na do a little work . So why do n't you just finish this ? You two catch up , and you know how to fix these . You do n't want pancakes anymore ? I do n't . No , I do n't . I 'm breaking up with Harry . What do you mean ? Why ? - l met someone else . - ln the two days since you 've been gone ? You know me , my life 's crazy . I meet a thousand new people every day . Besides , let 's face it . He 's
zone2	to keep this thing going . True . But you know , he 's ... . l know . He 's soulful when you do n't expect it , right ? Oh , my God , he 's unnerving . Mom , listen . I was thinking , if you could handle this ... you and Harry . I ca n't handle it , would n't want to handle it . You 're only saying that because you think that he and I have had sex . Lower your voice . - Have n't you ? - Never , not even close , I swear to God . I 'm putting this out there ... because for two people who are convinced they 've got life beat ... something was cooking in the kitchen last night other than pancakes . - Hello ? - l 've waited a reasonable amount of time ... before calling you even though you 've been on my mind ... since I woke up at 5:15 . I 'm wondering when we could go out again . I have to work the next few nights

I look forward to seeing you , too . - He 's all yours . - Stop that . How 'd he take it ? He just took care of it for me . He was an ace . Elegant . He said our fate was to be friends . Oh , my God . He was breaking up with me . I did n't even ... . - He 's a genius . - That 's not possible . He would n't . He absolutely did . And you know what ? It does n't matter ... ' cause we 're done and we both feel fine about it . Okay ? Clean slate . I got ta go . Okay . Now , Erica . Try to think of this as the smartest thing you 've ever done for yourself . Candles
zone2	- l just kissed you , and I ... . - No , honey . I kissed you . I know that one was me . Try not to keep score . Soft lips . I 'm so glad they still work . I have n't used them for kissing in such a long time . More like for wearing lipstick , and whistling , and ... . Well , well . Now look who 's got something that works . You did n't even take any Viagra ... . Kiss me before you make it go away . This could be world-class interesting . Yeah . Having any doubts ? Yes . Me , too . But so far ... the kissing is spectacular . I 'm not grading you , I 'm just mentioning it . Like , brilliant . I ca n't get past your damn turtleneck . Cut it off . Please . Cut it off . - Are n't you full of surprises ? - Yeah . Yes . You 're beautiful . Open your eyes so I know you hear me . Beautiful .

God , I ca n't see . My glasses . 120 over 80 ! Baby ! Oh , my God . I do like sex . You certainly do . Oh , God . So this is what you 're supposed to do on a rainy afternoon ? I really thought I was ... sort of closed up for business . I never expected this . Nothing 's ever surprised me more . This is crazy . I ca n't remember the last time I cried . I think I 'm overwhelmed . Me , too . Oh , God , that 's the perfect word . Baby , I had sex three days after a heart attack and I did n't die . That 's got ta be some kind of a record . Yeah . Let 's just not brag about this to your doctor , okay ?
zone2	one thing I am is discreet . Yeah . What ? You know I 'm not good at being monogamous , right ? Monogamous ? Please . I hardly know you . But why Paris ? I always wanted to write a play that ended there . People need romance like that . If somebody like me does n't write it , where will they get it , real life ? Excuse me ? What do you call this ? Eating eggs by candlelight in our robes ... after ... . Sorry . Where do you like to eat in Paris ? I love this little bistro called the Grand Colbert , behind the Palais-Royal . It is the best roast chicken in the universe . You 'd be fun to go to Paris with . It is the best city to stay up all night in . When is your birthday ? - February . - Mine 's January . How about if we still know each other by then ... we go to Paris for our birthdays ? Maybe . You just said ... . You know something
zone2	I do n't know how to be intimate , but not intimate . The color is draining from your face . Look , I 'm gon na pee . Take one of your blood pressure pills ... and when I get back , let 's not talk anymore . Oh , God . You 're the funniest girl I ever had sex with . Well , that 's something . Honey . I think I should go back to my room . Let you get some sleep . - Let me sleep ? - Yeah . Right . You usually send the girls home . But I am home . I 'm an old dog , you know ? It 's perfectly ... . Whatever . This was ... a great night . For me . Me , too . Yeah ? At one point ... I even thought ... soul mates . Good night . I 'd like to try sleeping with you . Oh , my God ! Hi . What time do you think it is ? Can you see this ? Not really . lt looks

Thank you ... for everything . You 're gon na be okay . I am ? This is the second time I 've done this . It 's like I get overcome or something . It 's so out of the blue . It 's pretty common to become emotional after having an episode like you 've had . Everything takes on a new meaning . So it 's not crazy for a guy to do something so totally out of character ... after having a heart attack ? - You mean like crying ? - Yeah . And completely changing their taste . Like , suddenly ... really liking something that you never thought you could ever like . Ever . It 's unnerving . You can expect just about anything right now . People have done some wild things after having a heart attack .
zone2	? I 'm gon na go back to being me ... are n't I ? We 'll see . Here you go . You can have these back now . I confiscated them on your first night here . Thank you , darling . Try not to smoke them . I packed you a sandwich just in case your blood sugar got low ... with some of that iced tea you like ... and a non-fat , low cholesterol cookie , and a peach . What a doll . You got something else . Something to remember me by . There is that . We 'll always have Paris . Bad joke . - Honey ? - Yeah ? No words can ever express my gratitude ... for taking me in ... and taking care of me . Your heart attack could be the best thing that ever happened to me . I love ya . I love you , too . If that 's what you said . I do n't know if it ends in a " ya , " if it 's an official " l love
zone2	anybody . - l knew you 'd call . - Who ? It 's me . What 's wrong ? I had breakfast with Dad , and we 're talking . He starts looking all weird , and tells me he met someone three weeks ago ... and that it 's really something . And then he tells me he 's getting married . Why am I reacting this way ? I 'm almost 30 years old ! Wait . Who is he marrying ? I do n't know . Some chick he met three weeks ago . She 's two years older than me . She 's an ear , nose , and throat doctor . Has he lost his mind ? I have this huge auction tonight ... and I 'm really upset . My shrink is away for two weeks . Can you come in ? I know you 're working , but just , please ? I get that he has a right to get remarried , but he does n't even know her . And she 's my age ! Do you know what that
zone2	not like I think he 's replacing me , because I know he is n't . And I know I 'm too old to act like this . lt 's nuts ! First of all , please do n't smoke . If he is replacing anyone , it 's me , not you . And all the statistics say ... that divorced men usually remarry . It 's the way they 're built . Wan na know the answer to why I 'm always with the wrong guy ? This is why . Because the wrong guy ca n't do this to you . This is my big fear , that some guy can get me unglued like this . And this is just Dad ! We know this about me . I am not cut out for this kind of drama . I think it 's the drama in life that makes you strong . You always say things to me like this . You never understand that everyone is n't like you . I 'm sorry , but if I were you , and my ex-husband ... the
zone2	were getting remarried to a 33-year-old ear , nose , and throat babe ... I 'd be bonkers ! And look at you . You 've never looked better , by the way . Marin , we 're all set .

" I need you to come out to dinner tonight with me , Dad , and the fiancee . Absolutely not . No . - Mom , you have to ! - No , I am not . Yes , because he wants me to meet her . I ca n't go alone . I asked him if you could come and he said it 's fine , and she said it 's fine . You 'll have to meet her , anyway , so we might as well do it together . Come on . Please ?

After all , she did go to medical school . Not in front of the kids . - What do you see that you like ? - What are you having ? I do n't know . I 'm looking at the grilled salmon . Who would like what ? Mom , are you okay ? - Sure you 're okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . - You sure ? - Yes . Good . If we wanted to go pasta , we could get the fresh rigatoni .

What was I thinking ? I have never lied to you . I have always told you some version of the truth . The truth does n't have versions , okay ? Will you cut me a little slack ? - My life has just been turned upside down . - Mine , too . - Then let 's each get our bearings . - l do n't want my bearings . I 've had my bearings my whole goddamn life . I felt something with you that I never really knew existed . Do you know what that 's like ? After a 20-year marriage , to feel something ... for another person that is so ... . Right . Not your problem . Do you know that I 've written this , but I never
zone2	is ? - No . This is heartbroken . How 's that for impervious ? You 're killing me . I just wish that it had lasted more than a week . Me , too . That is a terrible thing to say . You know , the life I had before you ... I knew how to do that . I could do that forever . But now look at me . What am I gon na do with all this ? Taxi . Can you wait just a second ? The truth is ... I do n't know how to be a boyfriend . That 's what you have to say after all of this ? That you do n't know how to be a boyfriend ? That 's not a small thing . Are we done ? I do n't know . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . - Came in by cab . - He 's got a seven . Vital signs are stable . Respirator is on its way . Fifteen minutes of chest pains , hospitalized a week ago with
zone2	. - Hang a nitro drip . You ca n't . I took Viagra . You have been through this before . Let 's run a 12-lead EKG . You 're having chest pain right now ? No . And the pain I was having was sharp , not like before . That 's good . " Not like before " is what we like to hear . I was really out of breath , like I could n't catch it . Okay . Give him an aspirin and let 's run a blood gas . What were you doing at the onset of the pain ? Having a fight with someone . A woman . - Can a woman give you chest pains ? - Are you kidding ? - Love hurts , have n't you heard ? - l 've heard . I just never personally experienced it . - You 've been lucky . - Yeah , lucky . All right , your EKG looks perfectly normal . Your heart rate 's good . The kind of pain you describe is not the kind we generally worry
zone2	on by stress . Stress ? And in case you have n't heard , stress can give you a heart attack . I have no idea what you 're up to ... gallivanting out and about at this hour one week after having a heart attack . But if you were my dad ... I would have you home in bed , recuperating . " lf you were my dad . " Hi , it 's Erica . I 'm not here , so leave me a message . You have one new message . Message one : Erica , hi , it 's Julian . I 'm in the restaurant , and I 'm just wondering if you 're on your way . It 's about 8.20 . It 's a lovely night out here , it 's a nice ... . Oh , my ! Yeah , go figure . Mom , we 're going into town . Okay . Are you crying ? Yeah . It 's my new thing . I 've gotten abnormally brilliant at it . Why ? What is it ? I 'm
zone2	I got ta learn how to do that " love them and leave them " stuff . - Mom , I hate this . - No . Now do you get my theory about all this ? You got ta self-protect . You do n't really buy this stuff you say , do you ? You do n't actually think that you can outsmart getting hurt ? I think it 's worth trying . Listen to me . You ca n't hide from love for the rest of your life ... because maybe it wo n't work out ... maybe you 'll become unglued . It 's not a way to live . Are you telling me this is good , what 's happened to you ? I think you should consider the possibility ... that you and I are more alike than you realize . I let someone in . And I had the time of my life . I 've never had the time of my life . I know , baby . And I say this ... from the deepest part of my heart . What are
zone2	. Harry , you 're looking grand , man . - Hi . - Hey , good to see you . You having fun ? Not quite . I got you something great at the farm stand . These are for you to give me when you apologize . I hope you know how mortified I am by my behavior . I was gon na get in touch , or send you a note , something . - A note ? - A note . That 's a little chilly . I 'm embarrassed . I just have n't been myself lately . What can I say ? Just tell me you 're sorry . I am sorry . Then you could kiss me . Kiss you ? - You 're gon na forgive me if I kiss you ? - l think so . No one on earth would forgive you for that kiss . May I ? I forgive you . Yes ! - lt 's the best thing you 've ever written . - lt is ? - lt 's wonderful . - lt is ? Yes
zone2	's funny . How great is it for you that I 'm not intimidated by your brilliance ? Must we go through this every time ? Come here . Good . That 's very good . Anyway , you know what I 'm gon na do ? Oh , my God . I got ta tell you . I 'm totally excited about this audition . It 's such a great part . Supporting , but she 's a really funny character . There 's this totally hilarious scene ... where she 's dating this older , chauvinistic guy ... and just as they 're about to do it , he moans . So she 's just thinking that he 's really into her ... except he 's having a heart attack . And she 's totally creeped out ... and her mom , who basically despises the guy ... rushes in and gives him CPR and saves his life . Are you okay ? Is n't that funny ? " Hold on , let 's not get so dramatic here . " What are we , four teenagers ?
zone2	n't we all stay for the weekend ? " Your mother has work to do , I 've got papers to grade . " You do what you 're going to do , whatever that might be - - " I need to talk to you . Got a minute ? - So your play is about us ? - No , it 's about me . - Am I in it ? - A guy like you is in it , but he 's not you . What happens to this guy who 's not me ? I have n't totally decided . He can live , or he can die . - What are you leaning towards ? - Death . It 's funnier . He dies of a funny heart attack . He 's a schmuck who screwed around with our heroine ... so it wo n't be too sad . Schmucks are people , too , you know . Death does n't seem a little harsh to you ? I just went where the story took me . It 's a work of fiction , just
zone2	do the hospital " Do you take Viagra ? " scene . Should we wait for you ? Yeah , good . That 's fine . So I 'm gon na be the laughing stock of Broadway ? Harry , he 's not you . He 's a version of the truth of you , so to speak . - Sorry to interrupt . - lt 's okay . Dave wants to know , when Henry says " l love ya " ... you want that to be " ya , " not " you , " right ? - Right . - Yeah . - You look really nice . - Thank you . Are you feeling all right ? You know , it is n't like I wanted to stop seeing you . We could have carried on a fun thing for a while . Why is it that you broads want all or nothing ? I do n't know . - We 're just goofy when it comes to love . - Yeah . If it 's all right with you , I 'd like to be
zone2	. How 's that ? Fine . I understand . Anyway , do you actually buy that horseshit ? That men and women can be friends once they 've had sex ? I 'm friends with my ex-husband , but then again , we did n't just have sex . We did n't just have sex , either . Then what was it ? I 'd love to know . Can I e-mail it to you when I figure it out ? Okay . Just moving into another phase with this thing . I 'm mad at you . - l think I 'm mad at you , too . - Excellent . Because I do n't like thinking about you so much ... and worrying about how you are ... and if I ruined your life . - You 've worried about me ? - Yes , honey . The schmuck who deserves to die ... worries about you . Sometimes , worrying about you feels like a full-time job . Doll , I 'm doing great . So you do n't have to work that shift anymore .

And if I were you , I 'd be pounding on my chest . Your diagnosis , although fascinating , was entirely incorrect . impossible .

Harry Sanborn , this is my husband , Danny Benjamin . - Heard so much about you . - l bet . You know , with the play and all . - l 'm famous ? - Just to us . In every interview my mom does , she always says she made you up . So the guy in the play does n't make it , does he ? He basically dies at the end of the second act . But it gets a huge laugh . I was hoping she 'd give me a reprieve . Yeah , well ... . - Good seeing you . Congratulations . - Thanks . How is she ? She 's really good . Up to her old tricks . Learning Italian , remodeling her apartment in the city ... . Now , if I wanted to see her , how would that go over ? Only one way

Showtime . - l knew you 'd be here . - You did ? At first I thought I had the wrong restaurant , but here you are . Just like I imagined . You mean we 're not just bumping into each other ? You came here to see me ? I 'm aware it was a bold move ... one of those impulses that grabs you ... but so far we 're okay . Right ? I mean , I kind of - - lt would be great if you 'd let me take that as a yes . Would you like a glass of wine ? Yeah , I would . I 'd love one . I was just gon na give you a kiss hello . Okay . Awkward . You remember how you said if we still knew each other ...
zone2	We still know each other . - That 's true . But , Harry , I have n't heard from you in six months . Yeah . After I saw you in the theater that afternoon with the dancing Henrys ... . - Yes . Sorry . - No , it 's very funny , by the way . - l had another episode . - l 'm sorry . As it turned out , I was fine , but I was sure I was dying . The doctor in the ER said I needed to decompress . So I did . I walked out of there and changed my life . Sold most of my businesses , packed my bags ... moved to an island in the Caribbean . That is where you 've been all this time ? In the Caribbean ? Actually , no . I was there about six hours when it occurred to me ... that wasting away on an island in the Caribbean ... could n't possibly cure what was ailing me . So I decided to take another kind of trip ... into
zone2	? I thought if I visited some of the women I 'd known ... maybe I could figure out how I arrived at being me . Yeah , it was quite a journey . Hi , Louise . You remember me ? Hi , how are ... . Some of the ladies , I 'll admit ... were n't too interested in seeing me or even speaking to me . But one day , my losing streak ended . One of them opened up to me . Hearing what she had to say was no picnic ... but I stuck it out and listened . And then I listened harder . And one of the things I realized ... was I was actually giving closure to generations of women . When you hear the same story about yourself ... over and over , your life begins to add up . It took me months to find them all . Visited a dozen different states . But I traveled the farthest to see you . I do n't believe it . Me , either . - Doc , how are you
zone2	you . - You , too . I should have told you he was coming ... but I was so engrossed in your story . Sorry I 'm late . What story ? Maybe another time . So I guess I should have seen your play .

You look good . You do . You look great . I have n't been on a gurney in six months , so that 's something . - l 've just been to every store in the city . - What ?

Secondhand smoke will kill you anyway . She 's very brilliant , but the woman can not hold her liquor . - l like that about me . - Me , too . Now , if I were writing this , this is where l would write : " An awkward moment . " Honey , if you were writing this , I 'd be dead . Never fails to amuse her . Here it is , thank you . - No , please let us . - No . Doc , I insist . I crashed your party . Please let me

zone2	The police of Tanage county have arrested the director of Gantang office , Konto , who was suspected to kill a four-year old child Tanage According to our investigation , the suspect , Konto , suddenly became crazy and killed his own dog near his own shop As Konto defended , he only hit his dog with metal stick as usual He did n't know that a child would suddenly go into the area It is reported that the people nearby heard Konto calling pupils as stupid thing And Konto always gets money by pursuing those cats and dogs which are roaming around He will tie them up and hit with metal stick Now the police are investigating the above events for further details Now comes the next news In Aogi of Yama county , the firemen has found a dead body of a 21-year old teenager , Kinshi , and his room-mate , another 23-year old teenager , Kataoka , At the beginning , Kataoka was very agitated But now the situation is under control Now the death of Kinshi is being investigated The police have found out a
zone2	investigation , Kinshi 's skin tissues have been found on Kataoka The police are now investigating for further details It is believed that this case is directly related to Kataoka But since Kataoka was very agitated , the process of investigation was hindered After he calms down , it is believed that he would be interrogated Maybe he would be brought back to the scene and reorganized the case The police now put Kataoka into prison and refuse bail The above are Japanese news and reported by Hirayama Is anybody there Why nobody is there Something is strange I 'm alright Madam , do you walk past here every day Are you their relatives No Then come with me Here is not a good place to talk What 's the matter It 's better for the shop to close down The shopkeeper has already changed to several people Not a single one can keep going Each one also becomes very strange Strange You also think so That couple does n't look like normal persons That land is the root of the problem That land ? When a person buys the
zone2	like that couple Then there would even have murders Sometimes mankind is really cunning In order to achieve their aims , they would hurt themselves deliberately and cheat for insurance compensation This kind of people deserve punishment What are you saying ? Derserve punishment That shop is not made by ordinary material What material do you guess Not ordinary material ? Mankind is really greedy The shop is not made by cement but the graves nearby They broke the graves and mixed the debris with other materials The boss of that construction company also died in a strange way It serves him right Miss . Ryoko You also know that it is strange I want you to tell me If I were you , I would n't pretend not to see anything and not to feel anything If so , I would rather accept myself to have such special power , right I can listen to them touch them Of course can even look at them Now I am always able to see Well But I will try to pretend not to see anything even though it is wrong to
zone2	think much about ghosts Really I think maybe because I have done something bad It is a retribution So I am able to see those strange things Nori , when you encounter some strange things , do you have such thought ? Maybe But other people really can not see anything In fact there are some other things which are not able to explain by logic The issue itself may not be on Nori or me These things are beyond the control of mankind after all So we do n't need to think about why there are strange things to happen But just to face it when these things have happened Do you really think in this way Miss . Ryoko You would feel better if you could think like this Maybe you wo n't agree with me But ... I would be very worried Sometimes it sounds like I 'm thinking too much I would feel better if just regard it as an ordinary thing What do you mean And the issue is not on me To regard it as an ordinary thing , do you want to tell

zone2	very soon I really feel a bit unhappy about that While the film is being shot , I have been very happy If the film has finished shooting , I will have a sense of loneliness I really want to keep working with the staff What did you feel when you first saw the script When I first saw the script , I found the beginning quite straightforward But having the experience of being a store-assistant , it is still valuable to me At the beginning , I was not that concentrated but later it was greatly improved I think I am going to be a good actor Do you watch scary films No When I see some scary scenes , I would be very frightened I would immediately use my hands to cover my face When did you first go to funerals I went to funerals before I will try my best Is there anything that is particularly hard to you It is that I had to get used to many new things at the beginning I was not used to at the beginning Did you seek advice from

zone2	226748 Question : How does a girl who falls - - No , actually , she jumps eyes open , down a rabbit hole , plummeting into chaos ... The answer ? She does n't . See , I know , because that girl is me . But to truly understand the predicament I was in i.e . , stuck in the middle of chaos you 'd have to go back to that first day at my new job . Actually , to be fair , you should go back a little further starting with Mom . Do n't worry . I 'm not blaming her entirely . She believed that all problems could be solved by listening to Carly Simon . Greatest Hits . Side two . Hurry . Something about her voice , or her lyrics , or her music helped Mom clear the chaos especially after a fight with Dad . Or when he left us for good . People said Mom was better off . They said she was lucky . But she believed ... . Luck is when preparation meets opportunity . You got ta prepare for the life you want . And though I

And while my roommates were n't as understanding as I 'd hoped ... - Come back to bed . - ... it did bring certainty . I 'm sorry , Bean . We have only but one road to travel in this life . And I just do n't think we 're on the same one . So to get more involved , or for me to over-commit myself would just lead to chaos . - How do you know ? - l 'm certain . I mean , what if you 're wrong ? What if we 're supposed to be together ? What if you just made the biggest mistake of your life ? Stacy , honey ! Smile ! Stacy , honey ! Smile ! There are moments in life where you hope your decisions were n't rash . Bean ! Bean ! And moments where you just know .

That 's before the past was a supermodel that barfed quietly . You know , I do n't pry into your old boyfriends . Here 's a little tip : I never dated Brad Pitt . All right . Shut it off , okay ?

He barfed too . Fascinating . And before Stephen ? I did n't date much . I was shy . And ugly . Why do supermodels say how

She called all the time , begging him , pleading , pathetic . He played me the messages on the machine . They were hysterical . She was desperate . One angry chef , coming up . I ca n't show her that . I 'd be purposely hurting a friend . Knowledge is a terrible and a marvelous thing . It just depends on your perspective . Think of it this way . If she knew who you really were , she 'd hate you . Can you blame her ? And , Stace ? She 's not your friend . Have fun at the game
zone2	I was in the middle of a crisis with Derek . I 'm helping him with something . Does n't he have someone else to help , like a girlfriend ? Probably a bunch . But ... . We agreed not to discuss anyone we date , unless one of us was serious . Then we have to , but he 's not , and I 'm not . So why torture each other ? You know , it 's just too painful for both of us . Sorry , that 's my cell . Hello ? Hey , I was just talking about you . Derek . So , what happened ? You might think it odd that I did n't strangle her as I watched her flirt and coo with my man . But I did n't . I was strangely drawn to their banter . Curious about this part of his life that I had been completely dumb to just a few days earlier . They had a past . - They had a present separate from me . - They scored . Listen . Can you
zone2	, but she did n't want to . Suddenly , I knew what I had to do . Finally I asked him to go back to his old girlfriend . Finally I asked him to go back to his old girlfriend . She called all the time , begging him , pleading . - She was desperate . - Joyce ? - How 'd you know her name ? - You mentioned it . - You did . - She did . I did ? Well , yes . Joyce . He only went back to her out of pity . Barb was right . As soon as Joyce realized that he 'd lied to her about Lulu she 'd never forgive him . Which was , after all , what I 'd wanted . So why did I feel so bad ? - l should n't have shown you that . - No , I appreciate it , really . It 's just so bad , you know . I probably did call him a few times when he was with her . But I was upset . I
zone2	But for her to know that I called means that he told her . Even if she did n't hear it , she knew , and that 's just so bad . Joyce , I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . - He 's in there . - Where ? Right there , with the orange sweater and the stupid haircut . It is stupid . Yeah . We stood there both of us sadly in love with the same man . Both of us feeling let down by him . Where are you going ? I 'm going home . I 'll see you tomorrow for the pre-interview . Good night , Barb . Wait , Joyce ? Wait . Please . Wait . - That tape , the Lulu -- - You know what , it 's not about the tape . It 's just talking to you and seeing Lulu . All that stuff brought up bad memories . And who am I trying to kid , you know ? A clean break is easier . You can reset it and it heals , and
zone2	or things do n't get put right then it just hurts . Forever . It 's really time for me to move away from him . From all this . I do n't even know who he is anymore . I should have felt happier at that moment . I had won . But the cost was high and the victory hollow . I had taken a good friend from someone I loved . And nothing about that felt right . I needed a reality check . I needed Mom . But she was out . So I settled for Carly . The line between right and wrong had blurred . In my search for truth , I had become the lie . Perhaps some secrets should remain secret . Okay , you guys are not that bright . Can I have an amen ? is everything okay ? It 's great . Yeah . - That makes one of us . - What 's the matter ? I 'm not feeling so , you know , good . You ca n't go home . I mean , I need

And there was something I needed to tell you . What was it ? - Oh , right . We 're live . - There she is . - Yikes . - Showtime . Great to see you . - Welcome to Kippie Kann Live . - Watch this ladder . I need a running order . - Who 's on first ? - You . - What ? - lt 's for you . - What is ? - Everything . Let 's see who 's at Kippie 's door . Just go with it . Stacy , oh , come on out . That 's right , Stacy . Make yourself comfortable . You look a little confused . - Know the name of today 's show ? - " Plastic Surgery Nightmares " ? No . Actually it 's called " Little
zone2	on some recent history . Stacy 's a new member of our staff who 's been using resources here to do her own personal research on her boyfriend , Derek . And three of his ex-girlfriends . - Oh , no . - Oh , no . Oh , yes . She went through his little black electronic book ... - ... found his ex-girlfriends ... - l do n't believe this . ... and interviewed them under the guise of being a guest on our show . - That 's my idea . - Wow , man , too bad . - Barb 's upstairs , if you wan na kill her . - And they will be . But not for the reasons they thought . Take , for example , supermodel Lulu Fritz . Welcome to Kippie Kann Live . You used us . You took my idea , and you set her up . - How can you just stand there ? - Camera two . - You stole my idea . - lt 's poetry . - You stole it . - l 'll share
zone2	Just watch . God , are you watching ? It was all superficial . Completely about sex . I 'd have to say no . That 's not from my documentary . That 's right , Lulu . lt 's all a ruse . A flower ? - A ruse , a joke . This woman ... - How can you do this ? ... Stacy Holt , a member of our staff , got you here under false pretenses . - Her name 's Barbara . - No , the woman producing is Barbara . The woman beside you is the current girlfriend of the man you once dated . - Stephen ? - Derek . Camera five . Doorbell . Camera five . Doorbell . Another woman scorned , and she does n't even know it yet . Come in , Dr . Keyes . Welcome to Kippie Kann Live . Drama , pathos , life unfolding . - lt 's good . - lt 's Greek . Go to three , Phil . - Camera three , go . - Dr . Keyes , you 're a
zone2	personal information on her boyfriend , whom you once dated . But I examined her . - Well , that was all a setup . - Even the warts ? No , it was a joke . There were none , ever . Ah , the apex . Joyce . She thinks she 's doing a pre-interview for a cook-off . That 's what you told her , right , Stace ? Come in , Joyce . Welcome to Kippie Kann Live . Here comes the tough part . You can do it . Welcome . What 's with the audience and all these - - ? - Lulu . - Oh , that 's right . You two go way back . But what about you two ? - Barb ? - No , actually , that 's Stacy . - Derek 's current girlfriend . - What ? No cook-off today . You lied to me ? After everything I told you , you lied . - Just like she did . - Are you referring to me ? - Shut up . - What did you say
zone2	in , shall we ? We sent our own Kippie Kann crew to the Kaleidoscope Kitchen posing as a crew for 48 Hours . - Then that was all a rose , too ? - Ruse , yeah . Roll it . - Why is she calling you Stacy , Barb ? - Because that 's her name . No , actually , my name is Barb . The other woman you met 's name was Stacy . - No , she was Barb . - No . - What ? - Stimulating as ever . I 'd say it 's nice to see you , but then I 'd be lying . Enjoy your meal . I got sick that night , and not on purpose . Stay put for more surprises when " Little Black Book " continues . Ladies , stay in your seat , okay . We 're still live . - l 'm sorry -- - Don't-- Do n't say another word . You wanted me to hate him ? Mission accomplished . I do . But , as bad as he is , he
zone2	could have a seat -- - This is completely unacceptable . I 'll sue this entire show for defamation of character . This is America , and you are welcome to sue anyone . But that release you signed is ironclad . I was told we 'd be discussing sexually transmitted diseases . Sexually transmitted diseases . That 's an idea . - Ninety seconds to air . - Ninety seconds . - l love it live . - You stoop to conquer . Yeah . I stoop . We all do . I mean , look at where we work . We march thousands of Stacys through here every year . We uncover their secrets . We spare no feelings . But suddenly you get a conscience because you know one personally . - You 're unethical . - You 're a hypocrite . - l 'm a hypocrite ? - This show is based on hypocrisy . You wan na call me unethical ? Okay . But do n't judge me and then worship Kippie for doing the same thing . We 're all swimming in the same
zone2	This is reality . Forty-five seconds to air , Phil . - Ira . - Underneath your seats there 's a Kippie Kann Live hat for each one of you . Kippie 's a giver . ... there 's a Kippie Kann Live hat for each one of you . Kippie 's a giver . - l got ta get to the control room . - Carl , you wan na handle this ? - Got it covered here . Thanks . - You 're all in on this ? - Everyone knew ? - There is no conspiracy here . Just a good idea for sweeps . - You can fight it . Seems pointless . - Lame . Really stupid . Or you could become a part of something bigger . Something completely different . Now , of course I can not -- But trust me , gon na be big . - Huge , it 's giant . - l 'm talking about a real show here . Changing formats . Breaking the fourth wall , and the fifth . Kamikaze television without restriction without hesitation ,
zone2	be on the ground floor . Thanks , Carl . But being that low does n't interest me . Do n't fool yourself . What you did was lower than anything I 've ever done . By the way , if you leave now , I will sue you for fraud . Oh , come on . It 's your 1 5 minutes . lt 's not so bad . - lt 's my life . - lt 'll be over soon . I meant the show . Five , four , three , two ... . Welcome back to Kippie Kann Live . And " Little Black Book . " I think it 's time to bring out the man of the hour . What do you say ? Are you ready for Derek ? Derek ! Derek ! Roll scream , roll doorbell . Derek , come on out . What the - - ? Derek thought he was coming to a surprise promotion party for Stacy . You 're in for it now ! Lulu ? Rach-- Joyce . What the hell 's going on ? What
zone2	. - You wan na tell him , Stace , or shall I ? Yes . I wan na tell him . I 'll do it . God . What 's going on ? - Tell him ! - They 're all here because of me . They 're all here because of me . See , after I heard about you and Lulu ... - ... I interviewed her . - You did what ? You know , look under the hood first , she 's Lulu Fritz . Thank you . - We got around to the sex question -- - Wait a minute . You 're not serious . She said that you guys did it , like , two , three times a day . It 's funny . I mean , why would she lie like that ? - What are you doing ? - Purging . You can go next . Then I went to Rachel . I wanted to go straight to Joyce , but I could n't . Not right away , so I made up this story about warts and went
zone2	it turns out , joke 's on me . You can shut the cameras off , because it 's never gon na air . We 're live in 70 markets . Hi , Mom . Hi , Mom . Then Barb and I browsed through your Palm . - Barb who ? - Barbara Campbell-hyphen-Dunn . Who sold me out for this show . Just like Carl 's selling Kippie out . At least , is n't that what you told me ? Yes , yes , that 's it . Turn the tables on us all . That 's real . lt 's honest . Phillip , get Carl . Jay , give me a shot to Carl . - What are you doing ? - Regurgitating . Something sexy just for you , Carl . - Who 's Carl ? - Stage left , crooked toupee . - Philip , on four . - Camera four , go . Get that camera off of me . Phil ? - Ca n't do this to him . - You hold that shot . Split the screen . Did you
zone2	can see that tape you wear on your face right there ? Then he edits it out of the copy he gives you . - Back to Carl now . - And those tabloid leaks . Nice , really nice . You 're burying Carl . I 'm burying him , her , you , me . We 're all going down . Go to commercial . No commercial . I 'm still running things . Stay with me , Phil . Not you . You 'll get promoted . I 'm out of here . I ca n't top this . Anyway , Barb and I were playing with your Palm , and we stumbled across a lovely montage of Joyce and your folks on holiday . Which is really odd , because you never bring girls home . - l don't . - You brought her . She 's different . Why ? - Yeah , why ? - Tell us ! You know what ? I 'm not doing this . - Why ? - You wan na get out of my way ? is she better
zone2	knew it . Maybe that 's why I had to meet her and when I did , I understood , because I liked her too . I liked you so much . I want you to know that . Not in a weird kind of way , but in a way that I thought maybe in some alternate universe we could be friends . Yesterday , you told me you were schmoozing up some new recruit and you 're schmoozing Joyce ? No , Joyce 's brother . Robbie Moore , the recruit , is Joyce 's brother . Joyce hooked us up because she 's trying to help me out . Then why would n't you have told me that straight up ? - l mean , why lie ? - l never lied to you ! - " Omission is betrayal . " - Yes . Oh , okay . Now you 're gon na tell me about betrayal ? What the hell do you call this ? I would never do this to you , ever . No ? Then answer me this . If we shared
zone2	? You should n't have to tell me everything , Derek . But why would n't you want to ? Unless there 's somebody else you 're waiting for . Someone who is n't afraid to say , " The past is n't past , Derek . " Or , " l really wan na meet your folks . " Or , " l really , really hate hockey . " - You do ? - Oh , to the bottom of the ninth . - That 's baseball . - You see that ? I was just too afraid to be honest with you , with myself , because ... . lf l was really honest gut-wrenching honest then I 'd have to admit that we were n't right the way you guys are . Were we ? There 's your show , Kippie . " My Boyfriend Belongs With His Ex and I Just Figured lt Out . " Sue me , Carl . Listen . I 'm fully aware that you may never speak to me again . And I understand . I do . But before
zone2	whole idea was n't planned out . It was n't premeditated . It presented itself , and then I guided it into this event . Now , granted , it was dramatic . lt was extreme but you dove head-on into the muck and came out with this masterpiece . And I hope one day you can understand that you got what you wanted , Stace : Your life back . I should tear your eyes out right now . But how will you ever be able to look at yourself in the morning ? Looks like we have an audience . Stay put . Kippie Kann Live and " Little Black Book " will be back after these words . Move it , will you ? The question : How does a girl who jumps into a rabbit hole plummeting into chaos , come out unchanged ? The answer : She does n't . No , it ca n't be closed now . Stacy ? Stacy Holt . lt 's Bean . - King . Bean King from college . - Bean . Bean , what are you doing

It 's just - - l have spent a lifetime preparing for a lifetime . And I was beginning to think it all went wrong somehow . But maybe you 're the reason , Bean . - For ? - Everything . Maybe you 're the plan I was supposed to hang on to . Bean ? The 8:00 was sold out . Should I try the 1 0:20 ? Yeah , sure , honey . I 'll be right there . That 's my wife , Colleen . You should come meet her . Love to , but I just got ta go jump in the river now . Hey , come on , now . Every plan I had for my life went so unbelievably wrong . John Lennon said , " Life happens when you 're busy making other plans .
zone2	You just got ta live . Stop planning your moves . Let them happen . I mean , you might be surprised . Do you believe in happy endings , Bean ? Yeah , I think so . How about you ? I do . Is n't that funny ? I still do with all my heart . Even when the girl does n't get the guy in the end . Or , in my case , both guys . - That 's amazing . Congratulations . - Thanks . You go find your happy ending , Stacy Holt . And thanks for the continuing patronage . By fall , I was ready to try again . A little bruised . A little humbled . And , hopefully , a little smarter . I believe we write our own stories . And each time we think we know the end we do n't . Perhaps luck exists somewhere between the world of planning , the world of chance and in the peace that comes from knowing that you just ca n't know it all . You know , life 's
zone2	wheel , you might end up right where you belong . Wow , that is such an amazing story . I mean , you went through all of that , and here you are . I can do this job , Jane . I 've been preparing my whole life . It 's too bad Diane 's gone . She is ? On assignment . She 'll be back next week . But before she left she told me , " lf you find someone great for this job I mean , perfect do n't let them go . " Welcome aboard , Stacy . You mean ... - ... I got the job ? - You got the job . Congratulations . Stay here . I 'll go check Diane 's calendar . Thank you . - Hello , Mama ? I got the job . - You got the job ? - You got the job ! She got the job ! - l got the job ! I got the job ! - She got the job ! - lt 's amazing , amazing , amazing .

Honey , are you there ? Hello ? Hi , I 've just come into the studio , and I think your friend fainted . She fainted ? Oh , my God . Who is this ? My name is Carly Simon . I 'm just here to meet with Jane . Oh , I think she 's coming around again , so I 'll give her the phone . Hello ? Mama ? Gone . Are you really Carly Simon ? - Yeah , I just - - - l ca n't believe this . - You just really made my life . - Are you Jane ? - My name is Stacy Holt . - Stacy . I just got a job here . Please do n't tell Diane that I fainted . - You really are Carly Simon .
zone2	- Yes , thank you . I 'm so mortified . I hug people when I 'm embarrassed . So do l . l do exactly the same thing . I think this is just about the greatest day of my life . So thank you . Thank you so much . I love you .

Now , how do you explain that ? The reasons for doing something like that would be ... Losing you there . Hold on . The reasons for doing something like that would be ... Could be many . Both ...

You said we could afford this house and take out a second mortgage so that we could put in the pool , redo the kitchen ... - I said that . ... and now we are on the verge of losing the house .

zone2	... Oz and Debbie Peterson former employees of now-defunct Globodyne were charged with armed robbery ... - ... after holding up a local branch ... - Dick . Dick , that could have been us . What were we thinking ? - and turned to crime as a result of their sudden unemployment . Like this woman , Naomi Seiler , a human-resources manager caught last May managing a different kind of resource : 220 kilos of Canada 's finest marijuana . I knew her . She always remembered everybody 's birthday . Or this man , Mark Fish , a former VP of Globodyne who was arrested after using his home as the setting for secret high-stakes cockfights . Mark Fish ? He was such a nice guy . Globodyne CFO Frank Bascombe starts serving his 18-month prison term next week . - Eighteen months ? That 's nothing . - Bastard . - trying to incriminate Jack McCallister . - Oh , yeah . - I do n't think I got away with anything . The collapse of Globodyne hurt me financially and personally just like any other
zone2	et up about it . Now watch this shot . Did I get him ? - Now you did . - Great . Look at that guy . Everybody 's in hell , he 's on vacation shooting stuff . Man , I hope every one of these bastards get what they deserve . Prosecutors say next to be indicted will be company spin doctor Dick Harper . - Harper gave misleading statements ... - What ? Indicted ? ... about Globodyne 's finances one minute before the company ... - Indicted ? - That 's not fair . They made you go on that show . You hear what they said ? I 'm gon na be indicted . - But you only said what they told you . - Indicted , Jane ! Indicted . I 'm gon na be indicted . - Wait , it 's gon na be ... - Indicted ! - Honey ... Dick ... - Indicted ! - Honey ... - Gon na be indicted ! Hold it , they ca n't ... It 's gon na be okay . Just calm down
zone2	na be indicted . Indicted ! I 'm gon na be indicted ! Indicted ! I 'm gon na be indicted ! Be indicted ! You know , I have n't seen you in the downtown club for a while , sir . Well , that 's because I was very , very busy being indicted . Look at all the executives . You guys are my kind of peeps . Captains of industry , masters of the universe presidents of Hair Club for Men . That 's a nice piece of hair . You ca n't even see the tread marks . This squirrel died of natural causes . Excuse me , pardon me . I got ta get to the " toppytip " of the financial summit . Is n't anyone going to do anything ? This happens every week . This guy actually is n't that bad . I 'm a corporate puppet . And I 'm gon na need some more string so I can go on believing I 'll be a real boy someday without being manipulated ... - No , no , no ,
zone2	, my God , Dick . Come down from there . Hon , I 'm in the middle of a very important meeting . Sweetie , you 're standing on a table pretending to be a puppet . Who 's pretending ? - Could n't you have just cut him off ? - He only had half a beer . Dick , hi . Long time no see . - Frank ! Frank ! - I 'm gon na get him . Just ... Frank , where are you going ? - Dick ! - Come on , Frank . I just wan na have a talk . Hey there , Frankie . How do you like those eggs Florentine ? Wait , wait , wait ! Wait , it was Jack . It was Jack . He siphoned off all of Globodyne 's assets and then he dumped the stock . It was his plan from the beginning . Son of a bitch ! That fucker ! - Hon , language . - She 's right . When you get out of prison you 'll get $20 million to
zone2	think I could have gotten 20 ? You son of a b ... - You 'll break ... Dick . - I want him . - Let go . - Do n't you think I feel terrible ? Why do you think I 'm drinking myself to death ? Instead of drinking , why do n't you do something about it . Yeah , Frank . Sometimes the cure is a clean conscience . - That is good . - Thanks , hon . - I just thought of it . - You did ? - Yeah . - You 're right . You 're right . Help me up . Help me up . Yeah , help me up . I got ta think of something . Okay , just give me a minute . Just give me ... Hey . Hey ! - Not this time , Frank . - I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . It 's force of habit . I know a way . I know a way . But it 's really , really risky . That 's
zone2	liquid U.S . bearer bonds . So it 's a vault job . Go in after midnight , bypass security and ... power tools . - It 's a little simpler than that . - Power tools ? Jack 's gon na have to take those bonds out of the safe-deposit box . That should be fun for him . Here 's my babies . So , what 's he gon na do with the money ? There it is , the Grand Cayman Bank . Grand Cayman . What is this place ? It 's where rich people go to evade taxes . - Bastards . - Honey . They ca n't hear us . What 's next ? McCallister takes the bonds to a representative who asks him for his signature to verify what they call " membership . " Once the bonds are counted and confirmed McCallister will receive a CRM- 114 deposit form and on this form he inputs his account number that only he and the bank know . Then the agent will take this to an authorization officer for further verification . Once the
zone2	will take the CRM- 114 back to McCallister for final approval before finalization . You said this was gon na be simple . Can you explain it again ? Jane does n't seem to understand . - Jane , it 's simple . It 's so simple . - Jeez . Now , listen . All we have to do is switch McCallister 's CRM- 114 with his account number with one of our own . - I 'm so sorry . - A copy that we have made that has a number from an account that I have established . And Jack sends the 400 million to us without knowing it . That 's ... You got it . It 's so simple . That is beautiful . It 's a switch . - It 's a switch . - It 's a switch . - It 's a switch . - That 's so sexy , man . - That 's unbelievable . It 'll be fun . - But Jane 's gon na have to do it . Because if McCallister sees either one of us ,
zone2	? - Do nothing . I can do that . Yeah . Okay . - You do it , then . You 're the one . - Yeah . Yeah . - You could do it , except ... - No , it 's good . No , you do it . You do it . You do it . - You deserve to do it . - Honey ... Are you ready to make the switch ? Do you have the form ? - It 's right here . - We should practice the move . - No , I got it . - Okay , fine . I wo n't be involved . I wo n't participate at all . - You do it . It 's all you . - Let 's do one for good luck . I got dressed up . You 're not doing me any favors . - Get out of the car ! - I just think it 's important . That 's all . Okay , I 'll be the bank representative . And you be you . Hey . Hey
zone2	no . No ! - Sorry . - Everybody ready ? - No . - What ? - Well , Dick lost the form . - So ... - What ? Do you have an extra copy ? Do you have any idea what I went through to get that ? ! Oh , let me guess , a fifth of Scotch ! You son of a ... Wait . Stop it . Knock it off ! My God . Wait a second . Can we get another one ? Is that possible ? How can we do that ? You know what , I 'm gon na take the car and I 'm gon na try to delay McCallister . - He 's here . He 's here . - Oh , God . - What are you ... ? - I 'm going . That was not cool . Okay . It 's very simple . I got it . - I got it . It 's very simple . - What ? Go into the bank . Go into the office of the client-relations coordinator . The

Ilona Tasuiev , this young 22 years old scientist , promised to a brilliant future , has been kidnapped while on her way to help underprivileged people . Can Avalon accept this ? No ! We 've always considered such acts , to harm any of our employees , as a personal attack against the whole company . Ilona 's sister . Bislane Tasuiev . She 's working for Avalon , at the archives . Ilona saw her ... just before being kidnapped . It 's Dr Muller , her superior , who gave the alert . As for the 71 , it 's the jungle . 4 homicides , 32 complaints ... Are you listening ? I 'll see her later . Tell her ! I want to know everything about her . Habits , vices , obsessions , strengths , weaknesses . Her colleagues , her friends , her lovers . Avalon must give
zone2	as the list of her patients . Put some pressure . The narcotics will tip us on the 71 . Without a ransom demand , we should n't neglect any lead : industrial espionage , robbery , sexual crime . The kidnapper bypassed the watchmen and security cameras . He 's fast , calculating and organised . It 's not his first kidnapping . Amiel ... Check the convicts , the psychopaths and those released on parole . Montoya . Check Ilona 's car . Contact Gavary and Lionet at the Casbah . If the car appears somewhere , they 'll know about it . Is it clear ? We find the girl then we can rest . Does anyone know where she went ? Woeller ? Sport shoes , size 38 . Considering the footprints the kidnapper must weight around 60kg . A woman . Or a teenager . Make a DNA search on everything we found . Cigarette butts , various wrappings . I have some information about Muller . He was a researcher in genetics for Avalon . I 'm switching to e-call . When his brother
zone2	in an Avalon 's clinic . Dog hair ... here and there ... I found some old underwears . A lil ' tip ? She 's working at Avalon 's laboratory . But Ilona is regularly on duty here during her free time . There are better things to do to relax . Facing reality puts ideas back in place . Genetic exploration is hazardous . I 've known more hazardous things . Research is a never ending fight . Lose its the purpose and you 'll lose its meaning . That 's why I 'm pushing young people to get their hands dirty . Is it the reason you quit ? You did your duty . I realized I 'd be more useful here than in a laboratory . You 're still working for Avalon . It 's difficult to get away from Avalon . You called the police at 0h34 . A 22 years old girl is 20 minutes late . Do n't you think it was a bit too fast to sound the alarm ? Unfortunately I think I was right . She 's never been late

An abnormality provoking premature ageing . A disease affecting children . A tough fight I used to carry on myself . It was a long time ago . Come ! Did you miss me ? Karas ! I hate it when you come here . Me too . So ? Nobody knows anything about the girl . Her sister is often at the Zbench and at the 71 . I do n't give a shit about the sister . I 've got nothing else .

Do n't take me for a damn fool ! I saw you together last night . Did you forget ? Ah yes ? And ... I have n't talked to the cops yet . Not yet . That 's what she wanted . I was supposed to steal it for her . What ? What is it ? She did n't pay me the last instalment . Health Beauty ... Longevity ... Avalon ... We 're on your side for life . Let go of me ! Let go of me ! Calm down . I wo n't hurt you . It 's already done
zone2	I kidnapped her ? You tell me . You 're the cop ! Stop running me around ! You found me . Are you always so aggressive ? Only when my sister is kidnapped . We 've always been very different . Even when we were children . Before the death of our parents . Did they die during the war ? I was 15 years old , Ilona was only 10 . I took care of her after that . We 're very close to each other . But it 's complicated . Avalon noticed her , she was 13 years old . They took us here . We would still be there without her . And Dellenbach ? He changed her . She has faith in her . Talk to me about Dr Muller . She met him when she started her Ph.D . He offered to help her in exchange of some duty at the clinic . They admire each other . Anything else ? Let me known if there 's anything else . Do n't hide anything . Or I 'll know it sooner or later

You can understand , ca n't you ? To protect such a scumbag ? He was n't always like that . This investigation will be very difficult with friends like that . What about you , Karas ? Do you always meet perfect women ? No . You 're wasting your time in this shitty world . This shitty world , it 's the only one I know . If you know
zone2	must have missed something . It 's here somewhere . We 'll inevitably find out . This way ! Move it ! Hands up ! Igor Vord ? You 're under arrest ! No ! Him , not Igor ! Igor Vord , where ? Igor ! Igor ! 2 more names for the same face on different metro-passes . We 're right in the middle of an identity traffic . Er ... Absolutely , captain . Er ... Vord , Novalis and Hemen . All incinerated here . Igor Vord , 10 years ago , in march 44 . Thomas Hemen , 5 years ago . Alfred Novalis will be incinerated next month . As you can see everything is noted here . Those deaths were n't registered . According to my report the hospital took care of them . You can have a look by yourself . Burial certificate sent by Avalon 's clinic . Everything is in order . The same doctor signed for the 3 of them . Dr Muller . Nora , call Reparaz , we 're going to Muller 's place . We 're
zone2	. He knows we 're making some progress , he has the picture of the kidnapper . You have nothing . Muller signed the 3 burial certificates . He 's signing 300 of them a year ! A fuck up will be his lawyers delight . I do n't give a fuck , I want a warrant ! It 's 5 in the morning . I need at least 1h . Karas ! Listen ! I 'll get you if you go in ! Karas ! Police ! Amiel ... Investigate on Muller and Avalon , year 2006 . Report anything you can find . Why do n't we have this kind of stuff ? Remain calm . They pirated my e-call , they shot me ! I want a warrant for arrest for Dellenbach . You do n't have any evidence . They were Avalon 's men ! You break into Muller 's house and you kill 2 men . Do you want to be decorated ? Muller is behind Ilona 's kidnapping and Avalon is covering up for him . What 's your share in this ? What
zone2	Nice show ! Go fuck yourself . You 're not alone . You have a team with you . You were right about the metro-passes . They 've been used around Muller 's district . I gathered all I could about 2006 . Muller was one of Avalon 's greatest hope . He quit everything after his brother 's death . He tried everything to save him . But Claus was infected by an incurable disease . Progeria . Muller ? It does n't make any sense . He took advantage of his situation to steal identities . The book belonged to him . Muller is involved . Why Ilona ? She discovered something about him during her research . I must find out what happened in 2006 . Why did Ilona want this book so badly ? But I need you for that . What ? Avalon archives ? You hate your job . It 's too dangerous . It never stopped you . Where are you ? I 'm heading to the archives . It 's fine , I see you . Ah ! Do you understand ,
zone2	very careful . I can see everything Ilona consulted on 2006 . Focus on progeria and Muller . Oh shit , an alpha confidential ! What ? A secured file . I can check it but I 'll be discovered . Too dangerous . It never stopped me . There 's ... Children who all carry a mark on the back of the skull . A triangular scar . What did they do to them ? We put a definitive end to Muller 's protocol . He 's the guy on the book . Dr Nakata . Our supply of patients depleted after these deaths . Genetic experiment tests all failed . Intruder alert ! Block 4.6.4 . Intruder alert ! Maximum alert ! We 're terminating the tests . Bislane , get out of here ! Authorizations have been rejected . All files relating to our research have been destroyed by Dr Muller . We lost 9 children . 7 of them had mutated before dying . They 're here ! Move away ! They were all suffering of heart condition , pulmonary troubles and brain damage . Code
zone2	Stay put during the duration of the alert . They shut down everything ! Stay put during the duration of the alert . I ca n't see anything ! Karas ! Karas ! What is it ? Who 's there ? Ah ! - It 's me , quiet ! - They killed the children ! - I heard , calm down . We 're gon na get out of here . Find them and do n't lose them , understood ? Try to get rid of the girl . We 'll leave at dawn . We should sleep . I grew up in the Casbah . Do you think I 've always been a cop ? I have no other choice than to trust you . But if you 're still hiding something . Stop ! You 're crazy ! I 'm not afraid of you . You 're the one afraid to reveal yourself . No one is born as a gangster . You become one , that 's all . Me , Farfella ... We still were kids . It was a game for us . One
zone2	rival gang trapped us , they lock us up , and beat the hell out of us . Run ! Run ! Run ! Farfella managed to escape . So , under what charge do we arrest her ? What the hell is this ? I do n't have any other choice . To protect you . Having sex with me does n't give you any right ! Where is Amiel ? He got a boy , the funny thing is ... What ? He wanted to call him Karas . But he got worried it might bring him bad luck . Anything on Nakata ? What would you do without me ? Of course , I did n't tell you anything . He was Muller 's assistant until 2006 . He 's the only survivor of the team . A 93 years old young man . You came to talk about Jonas Muller , did n't you ? I do n't care about your opinion . I 'm not ashamed of what I did . You killed all these children . We did everything we could to save them
zone2	. These children were doomed . We tried everything to save them . Muller could n't bear it when his brother died . He gave up his research , and destroyed all his work without hesitating . 20 years of work gone in smoke . The clinic was his redemption . Ilona was the only one to understand him . How do you know Ilona ? She came here for the first time about a year ago . She really wanted to understand Dr Muller 's past . She wanted to understand the reason of our failure . What did Avalon do ? They tried everything they could to convince Muller to keep working . They offered him a fortune . Captain ... Do you have the slightest idea of what Muller 's protocole was ? Progeria was just a step , not a final goal . Our protocole was n't complicated . It was even very simple . Our goal was immortality ! Ah , ah ! Oh ... What time is it ? - Immortality ! Some results must remain secret . Really ? Why , Jonas ?
zone2	ahead , shoot ! Be done with it and shoot . When I think I 've been admiring you for all these years ! Do you want me to tell you what you are ? A coward , that 's what you are . Do n't move ! Where is she , doctor ? Your gun ! Your e-call ! Call some back up . Karas ! What are you gon na do ? Shoot me ? On your side ! Tie yourself to the guardrail . She 's alive , is n't she ? Yes , unfortunately . I 'm not a murderer . I could n't convince her . I tried to warn her about those people . Tell me where she is doctor . I hear you . And I understand . It was n't easy . You do n't know anything . You 're completely wrong since the beginning . Ilona is the danger ! What are you talking about ? Just like me , 40 years ago . She found the answer , she discovered the secret . The protocol of immortality ! And Avalon
zone2	her . But then you 'll give Avalon unlimited power . The power of life and death will belong to them forever . No ! We 're running out of time . I 've been hiding my discovery from Avalon for 40 years to save us from hell . Without death , life has no meaning . Where is Ilona ? You 're not listening . Ilona is n't just another victim . If Avalon finds her we 'll all become victims . No , do n't do that ! You 're our last hope . Life is so beautiful , death will be sweet . In peace , I 'm reborn . Noooo ! What did he tell you ? What you really are . Lecturing people is n't my strong point but I 'm infallible to smell sons of bitches . Despite this talent , a lot of people die during your investigations . Dimitri Ostrovski . Jonas Muller . Hishiro Nakata . Do n't you know it ? Everything has a price , captain . The one we earn or the one we pay . I 'll
zone2	you . I originally came to smash you to bits . Now I only have to pick them up . Dr Muller death remain a mystery . Reserved , he dedicated his life to the poor . It 's a irretrievable loss ... He fell off the roof of officer Karas house . It may be a suicide . Captain Karas , recently suspended , remains at police disposal . People disappear around me . At least we have something in common . You 're not safe with me . We 're gon na make it . It 's just another little scar . What 's going on ? Karas ? The scar ! It 's Claus , Muller 's brother . Oh , my god . He 's alive . Muller had found the secret of immortality . To protect him from Avalon , he destroyed all his work . Except one important thing : Claus himself . He stole the identity of dead patients To allow Claus to live anonymously for 40 years . He condemned him to live trapped in the body of a sick child .
zone2	before me everything Muller did would have been useless . You 're not gon na abandon her ? I 'll find her . But she 'll have to forget her previous life . Promise me to save her . Promise me . I promise . You must hide . Dellenbach will do anything to hurt us . Hmmm , hmmm . Come back to me safely or I 'll kill you . After 20 years ... We 're finally even . May the Prophet be with you , Karas . Salam aleikum . I loved him too . Claus ? I know what you went through . I grew up alone too . Jonas took care of me when I arrived . He gave me back hope . He was like a father to me . I need you , Claus . Everybody is looking for you . The video from the subway security cameras near Muller 's palce . Carry on . Our friend gave us his nicest smile . Look . One more time . Closer . Stay on him . Closer . Stop ! We got him
zone2	I 'd rather go alone . I ca n't tell you why . Go back to your family . Wait , Karas ! Good luck ! Be careful . Karas ! Where is your captain ? I 'm losing patience . If you have better things to do ... Hmmm ... Your son weighted 3kg at birth . A beautiful child . Congratulations . It would be a shame if anything bad happened to him . But rest assured . Avalon always took care of its children . It 's only the 2 of us now . Ah ! Claus , I ... Ilona , let go of him ! Let go of him ! He tried to kill me . But I ... Come with me . I know who you are . You killed Muller . IT 's not true . He was crazy . He wanted to protect you . I do n't understand . What do you want ? Let go of me ! But ... no ! I promised Bislane to save you . And I 'll do it , that 's it . Help
zone2	them ! Let go of me . Please ! Ah ! Come on . They 're coming , Ilona . You must disappear . Forever . Hurry up . Come one ! Pleae , I beg you . You are our only hope . Our only hope ? Oh ! Who do you think you are ? The world is waiting for my discovery . Since the dawn of mankind . Avalon will change your dreams into nightmares . How can you know anything about my dreams ? Ilona ! You would n't understand . You 're not fit for that . Bislane is safe . You can have a new life . I want eternal life . Ilona , no , no ! Do n't do that . Ilona , stop ! Please , do n't do that . Our goal was immortality . Without death , life has no meaning . Promise me to save her . - Ilona is the danger . You do n't understand . Promise me . Ah ! Noooo ! - Karas ... Karas ... Karas ... I gave her a new identity

zone2	85498 1 ' 500 years ago most of Europe ... had abandoned its own believes and turned to the Christian faith . Only in the North did the people hold on to the Gods of their ancestors . The most powerful of these Gods was Odin . He reigned among the stars in Valhalla , and his ravens ... gave him wisdom and memory . But whilst the fire of the ancient powers faded ... a wonderous tale arose that captured the hearts of the people . It told of a blacksmith who slew a mighty dragon ... and won a legendary treasure : The dragon gold . Too many . Where are we going ? - Quick ! We ca n't hold the south wall any longer ! - Take our son and go , Sieglind . I 'm not leaving you ! Siegfried ! Xanten whelp ! Go now , go . My brother always watches out for me ! This way , my lady . What do we do ? - We must cross here , my queen . Over there ! Come on ! Get up here , Siegfried . Hold on tight . Hold on
zone2	, is n't it ? Who are you , boy ? What happened ? What happened ? - I do n't know . I ca n't remember . Oh ... 12 YEARS LATER 12 YEARS LATER What do you see ? - Be patient , child . Odin 's power is in the runes : They never lie , but they wo n't be rushed . - Hallbera , do n't keep me waiting . Fire will rain down from the sky very soon . Tell me more ! - And the light of that fire ... will reveal your destiny . So far from home . What destiny could I have here ? After the fire a man will come , a man as strong as you . The warrior 's strength will match your own . He 'll even beat you in battle . No one 's ever done that before . No one else ever will . We should anchor for the night soon . I better get the cargo ready for the king . You work on this till it 's cool . - All right
zone2	We look for Eyvind , the blacksmith . That 's me . They say your iron 's the best around . What can I do for you ? - What swords have you got ? Right now nothing at all . I can see a lot of " nothing " right there inside . - Oh , those ... were made for King Gunther of Burgund . - But he 's not here , and we are . Meaning that you plan to steal King Gunther 's property ? " Stealing " , he says . Just count yourself lucky we are n't offended . Erik . I think your iron is getting cold . Good day . I do n't like Saxons . - I do once in a while . Yeah , I know ... for sword practice . Look at that pale path of light ... That 's the road to Valhalla ... I wish I could see them sitting up there , all the great heroes ... at table with the Gods . And they are watching over us mortals . - But why do they
zone2	as we need them . We 'll fight on their side , when the evil powers attack us . How do we know what they want us to do ? - They map out our destinies . Think about all the signs in the sky . And if they see from up there , that we do something that 's bad for us , they get furious ! The Christians say their God is all about forgiveness . The Christians . They are a strange lot . Oh , look ! It 's Ragnarok ! The Gods go to war ! I want to take a closer look ! - No , no . Do n't go ! We should never meddle with the Gods ! Never ! You 're the woman from the longship . And you 're the man from the smithy . A tamer of fire and the elements . Then maybe you can tell me what this is . Some kind of strange metal . I 've never seen something like this before . Imagine the weapon one might forge from it . Is this metal
zone2	are . Never mind him , blacksmith . Tell me something . Do you believe in destiny ? Why ? We were both sent a sign that would bring us together here . That sign was big enough for the whole country to see . The only one's here are you and me . Today the runes promised ... to lead me to a man whose strength would be as great as mine . And you defeated me . I just wrestled you down . - No one has ever done that before . Until now . So you see ... We were meant to meet . Why do n't you stay here with me ? Oh , Erik , I would love to . But like you I have duties to perform . But I will wait for you . - But where will I find you ? Iceland . But there might be more than just one Brunhild in Iceland . Not more than one who 's queen . You 're the queen of Iceland ? Yes . Does that make a difference ? No . Not to
zone2	no matter what happens , I will love you forever . I promise I will come . Well , the Gods wanted it to happen . But I 'm a blacksmith , and she is a queen . Up north are many tales about blacksmiths who became kings . Really ? There 've always been things that are different about you , son . Maybe she felt them , too . Father , take me with you on your journey to Burgund this year . - Why ? Maybe the river holds an answer to what happened before you found me . You were never curious about it before . It never really mattered before . Maybe last night changed you . I do n't know anything about myself , I 've never even left the smithy . And now I feel I must . Let 's get the boat ready . We leave tomorrow morning . Thank you ! Thank you , father . What 's that ? Is it a war ? It sure looks like that . But who is the enemy ? King Gunther is at
zone2	- Lord Hagen . I see you have not changed . Nor have you ! - I got your message . What is it you want now ? - Fafnir , the dragon , is awake . You must convince King Gunther ... to gather his best warriors and kill Fafnir . Why would I put their lives at risk and mine ? I do n't care about the dragon . - You would n't say that ... if you knew what was hidden in his cave . - Go on ! The ancient treasure hoard of the Nibelungs ! You 've been babbling about that ever since they cast you out ... for trying to thieve it . Now you want me to believe that the hoard is here ? The dragon was sleeping on it ! So you 've wasted years of the mortal Life they cursed you with , and the treasure was under your nose the whole while ! That 's funny . You wo n't laugh so hard when you 've seen it . You 've never dreamed of such a hoard of gold and
zone2	keep the whole hoard for myself ? We know each other too well , you and I . Some of my blood ... courses through your veins too . - Do n't ever dare to speak of it ! You know it 's true . - Be quiet with you ! I know that you 're ashamed of " where you are coming from " . But remember how many times I 've helped you with my magic . We could help each other now . Very well , I choose the best of the king 's men . Move fast . Then again ... why do things have to be halves ? All right , Kriemhild . - Ready ? Let it go . Go ! So much for the pigeon . - I must work on its hunting technique . If he ever comes back ... Good to see you ! - Good to see you , my friend . There he is ! Are you sure he 'll come back to you ? - Of course ! He knows I 'm his lord and master ! -
zone2	get him back ! What a beautiful bird . He belongs to me ! - What 's it 's name ? Arminius . - Oh , like the great hero who ... chased the Romans out of the country . - Yes ! Now give him back to me , boy . Who are you calling a boy , boy ? I 'm the king 's brother , and I call common men what I please . Did you hear that ? What ? What 's that ? Aha . He says I 'm no common man , but the tamer of fire and the elements , and that 's what you should call me ! Shall we try again ? - Stop this nonsense , Erik ! Give back the hawk to Prince Giselher ! At once ! I hoped you would n't give up so easily . I 'll get you a new one . Eyvind ! - Oh , Lord Dankwart ! I 'm glad you got here safely . - We saw the devastation ... coming up the river . - It is a dragon .

You have a good eye for blades , my king . Forges and tempered by my son , here it 's well balanced in order to make it move like an extension of your arm . You 've learned your craft well ! - Thank you , my king . I 've always said : There 's no better weapon maker in the land . Eyvind , you arrived just in time . I need your best iron to help my men ... fight the dragon . - Brother , with this sword I could fight the dragon at your side . Let me come with you ! You know my answer , Giselher . It would not be wise to put 2 princes ... of Burgund in danger at the same time . - You handle it very well ! The balance is perfect for you . Please , keep it . It 's
zone2	This creature should be hunted down . I too ask to join your quest against the dragon . That is a task for only those warriors most honoured and favored by the king . Please excuse his impetuous youth , my king . I know exactly how you feel . What did you think , Erik ? That the king would be waiting for you to kill the dragon for him ? - I can do it ! With your mouth you can ! Make sure it reaches the right temperature . Are n't you helping me with this ? - It 's your sword . Did n't I teach you how to do it ? - Yes , you did . Then do it ! I will love you forever . To the forest of Fafnir ! May God be with us and grant us swift victory ! Do n't stare at the princess . It 's not polite . I 'm not starring . She is , though . Tamer of fire and the elements , may I enter ? You may . And please do call me
zone2	, would you care ... to pump the bellows , prince ? Thank you ! I came to thank your father for his sword . I neglected to do so earlier . Oh , he 's asleep now , but I 'll let him know that you stepped by . I 've never met a blacksmith who knows how to use the sword so well . My father always says you ca n't forge a good sword ... if you do n't know how to use one . What about your father ? My father was killed in battle years ago . My mother died soon after . How do you know when the iron 's ready ? - The feel . The way it looks . This one will need hammering for days . Is n't it wonderful to make such things ? - Do you have a talent or a craft ? I 'm a prince . I 'm not allowed to work . It would disgrace my brother , the king . Do n't you get bored ? - Yes ! If it were n't for my
zone2	quite a pretty girl . Every nobleman in our kingdom wants her . She does n't want any of them . Who does she want then ? - Why do you ask so many questions ? Are you smitten by her , too ? - My heart is elsewhere . I just hope my brother is able to kill the dragon . The king ! The king is returning ! Gunther ! Gunther ! The dragon 's hide was hard as iron . Our weapons were useless against it . Take him in . He will be avenged , my lady ! I swear it ! This is your masterpiece , my son . What will you call him ? - I do n't know . Why ? A sword as great as this deserves a name . Then I shall call you Balmung ! Balmung ? Balmung was the sword of the last King of Xanten , destroyed in battle Why do you want to call it that ? I just like the sound of it . Fafnir ! Come out ! Come out , you worm ! Fafnir
zone2	Come out ! Come on ! If you are wise , you will leave empty-handed . This gold is not for humankind . It belongs to us . I think it belonged to the dragon . - We are the keepers of the gold . Gold that only we can hold . The hoard was ours ' til Fafnir stole it from us . Heed our warning , or you too will pay . Who are you ? - We are the Nibelungs . The people of mist and twilight . You gave the gold back to us ... by slaying Fafnir . And we thank you for it . Thanks are very well , but I 'm the one who risked my life to kill the dragon ! That should be worth something . - It is not worth a single coin ... of this treasure , not when it comes with a curse . I do n't believe in curses . - The proof is outside . Fafnir lies dead because of it . - I think he lies dead because of me . And what 's this
zone2	the oldest thing in the hoard : Its heart . The one who possesses it , is the treasure 's owner . It 's beautiful . - And as deadly to you ... as anything else here . It 's going to take more than just words to frighten me today . I 'll be back for it soon . When the curse begins to bite , beware of it . It will find your weakness , and through it , destroy you . What sorcery 's this ? - Give it back ! - Who are you ? I should have known better . - What ? The dragon 's blood has made your skin impenetrable . - Listen , what 's to stop me from killing you , too ? - The magical Tarnhelm ! You can keep it ! It made me take your shape . What do I need that for ? I look like me already . Yes , but with it , you can wear any shape you desire . Prove it ! - Put it on your head . Listen , are you

Then I must look like you . Are you going to spare me ? Go ! Another mistake , young mortal . Now you also own his enmity ... and the curse . - Why ? Who is he ? His name is Alberich , and he was one of us . But greed awoke in Alberich . He wanted the treasure all for himself , like you . When he tried to steal it , we cast him out and stripped his immortality away . What about if we make a bargain ? I 'll only take half the treasure , and you keep the rest . Would n't that be fair ? Half the treasure , all the treasure , or just that single Ring is enough ... to bring the whole curse down on you . It 's all mine now . Lady
zone2	almost an insult to their rank . These men who ask for your hand ... are royal kings and princes ! - And I 'm a queen , their equal . And I have the right in my own land to make whatever laws I please . Then tell them that the Queen of Iceland will only wed the man ... who passes the tests she sets , and who can defeat her in single combat . But no man can hope to succeed at such tasks , Majesty . One man will succeed . And one man will marry me . And I will know that man as soon as I see him . You may go . You 're thinking of the man you met on the night the star fell , are n't you ? The blacksmith ? - I 've thought of that man ever since . And I will marry no one else , Hallbera . Not a prince , not a king , not the Roman Emperor himself . And if your handsome sword-maker does appear , what then ? And is he strong
zone2	? He has defeated me once already . Only he will defeat me again . The runestones do not lie . It 's Erik . Where have you been ? - Hunting . Any luck ? What is it ? What does it look like ? It 's a dragon 's claw . Where did you find it ? - On a dragon 's foot . Of course you did . You think you can fool your old father ? If you do n't like this claw ... how about its head ? What ? I do n't believe it . It really is the dragon ! It 's wonderful . Fafnir is dead ! Erik , the blacksmith ... killed the dragon ! - Yes , he 's dead . Do you hear ? The dragon is dead . Erik killed the dragon ! It 's over , it 's over . Thanks , I 'm fine . Gunther ! Erik killed the dragon , alone . This blacksmith must be blessed by God . - Or the devil . He succeeded where you and 12 of your best
zone2	he could use against you . He did this form me . Open your eyes , Hagen , and let your suspicious mind have a holiday . People of Burgund ! I command ... that Erik the blacksmith be proclaimed a hero of the Kingdom ! Long may he be honoured for his great victory ! Long live the dragonslayer ! Even the honour of guarding such a treasure would bring fame to Burgund . And respect for its king will increase beyond measure , once it is known ... that you have been entrusted with the safety of the hoard . My king , the dragonslayer is outside . - Send him in . It sounds most attractive , Hagen , but all of these benefits ... depend on what our young hero has to say . King Gunther , I am greatly honoured by your offer to hold the treasure ... in safe-keeping for me . But ... - You do n't trust the king ? I trusted him well enough to kill a dragon on his behalf , Lord Hagen , did you ? - That was
zone2	the word " but " usually means some difficulty . My king , it 's only I 'm not sure your treasury has enough room . Can I see your face ? - Oh , no ! That would ruin everything ! He is my only son . I brought him up all by myself . The father of our savior ! - Not just that ! I 'm also a sword maker , favored by the kings . And still a pagan ! - The hammer of Thor , the God of thunder , the working man 's God ... is my favorite . Are you baptized ? Yes , but tonight I am pagan again . Let 's go get some water . So what does a dragonslayer do now that there are no dragons left to slay ? He goes back to his smithy . With all the gold you brought back from the cave , you do n't need to work ! My father taught me the art of changing charcoal and ore into iron , and I enjoy doing it . Defeat dragons with iron
zone2	One ? Two ? A dozen ? None . My heart is pledged already . And who is this fortunate lady ? High-born or low ? High , I think ... or fear . Maybe too high . Perhaps she does n't know you love her so deeply , all sorts of arrangements might be made for such a great hero ... Would I know her ? - No . She lives far away . So . To whom is your heart pledged ? Are you married ? No , I 'm not . If I ever marry , it would only be for love . Will you finally come to me ? I 'm waiting for you , my love . Do you know who you are at last ? They call me Erik the blacksmith , Erik the dragonslayer , and Erik , the hero of Burgund . But these are just titles . One honest , one honoured , one honourable . But none of them are who you really are ... The twin kings have struck at Odinwood . They burned out towns ... and took
zone2	Bonna is under siege . Damn them . Damn them both . We 've lived in peace with the ... Twin Kings for almost 10 years . - Yes , but for most of those 10 years , Burgund 's treasury has n't been filled to overflowing with Fafnir 's hoard . Greed will negate any treaty . - How strong is their army ? 4 ' 000 , perhaps 5 ' 000 men . - We can match in strength . But they 're on the move . It does n't matter . Send messengers to all our towns . Muster the army of Burgund . We 'll leave at once . - My king ... Erik owes you no allegiance , but he killed Fafnir on your behalf . If he agreed to join the army , it certainly would encourage our warriors . And discourage the enemy . To meet a man who slew a dragon would give anyone pause for thought . Command ... no , ask that he rides with the Burgund host . - Brother , I also wish to ... Giselher , I
zone2	. If we do n't come back , you must live to defend Burgund . And your sister . Meanwhile we ride . Go . King of the Burgunds ! My masters , the good Kings Thorkwin and Thorkilt , do not wish fort his battle ! Since we outnumber you , I believe that . - We will spare your lives and ... spare Burgund its certain devastation , if you yield up to us the dragon 's gold ! I am the wrong man to ask for the gold , messenger . If your masters ... want the gold they must take it up with the man who slew the dragon . Let me talk to them , my king . - No , I will never allow this ! We will fight them together . It is my treasure , my king . And enough blood has been spilled over it already . My King , if the dragonslayer can help avoid more blood shed ... then let him . If he fails , we 'll attack . Another messenger ... I hear you want something of
zone2	gold . If you want it , you 're welcome to try to take it . But you 'll have to fight me first ! Big words for a blacksmith ! It takes more than gold to make a man worthy to fight a king . And it takes more than a crown to make a man to be a king . You 're nothing more than a Burgund whelp ! Xanten whelp ! You killed my father ! I am Siegfried ! Son of Siegmund , king of Xanten . You 're beaten , and your Kingdoms will be divided between the kings ... of Burgund and Xanten . I should kill you both for what you did , but that would n't give me any satisfaction . Just get out of my sight . I want him tied to the house of Burgund forever . What do you have in mind , my king ? - My sister will marry him . And I 'm sure you will not find this too difficult to arrange . Go now ! Father , I 'm awaken at last . I
zone2	, I hope , of a queen . Come to Iceland , my love , and find out . - Soon my love . But I 've won a mighty treasure , and I want to bring it home for you . Siegfried , you are the only treasure that I wish for . Hurry , my love , I 'm waiting . Now , you sent for me . What do you want ? Siegfried means to take the treasure back to his father 's castle in Xanten . He must be stopped . - A whole army could n't stop him . The king wants him bound to the house of Burgund through marriage to Kriemhild . But there is some other woman . - What do you have in mind ? One of your spells or potions ... If he could forget his other love and find the princess attractive instead , then the gold stays where it is . I think I can help you . If the price is right . What do you want ? - That boy took something from me . It
zone2	secret can look like anyone else . Siegfried knows that secret . - Interesting . Get me the tarnhelm back , and the potion 's yours . The potion first , thief . Once I have proof that it works , then ... you 'll get your Tarnhelm . - You 'll have it the day after tomorrow . Do n't ever call me that ! If killing you would change that , I would have done it long ago . As the moon wanes the heart wanders , sweet memory dwindles , the heart grows cold : Drinking the draft makes new love sweeter , past love a memory , withered and old , ' gainst potion 's power nothing prevails ... grey iron nor silver , jewel nor gold . Father ? Father ! Father ! What 's the matter ? Are you sick ? If old age is a sickness , yes . You just were working for a long time . You do n't have to work any more . There 's all the gold we could ever need . - Do n't tempt me with
zone2	You 're just tired , father . That 's all . I 'll get you something to eat and drink . - " Father " , can you still call me that ? Your true father was a king . You knew . - I suspected it . I saw the mark of the royal house on your tunic . And later I learned that the Twin Kings were looking for the lost son , but never found him ... Because you gave me another name to protect me . It would be a lie to say that that was the only reason . You see , I never had a wife , but with you ... I got a son . And it was such a joy to be a father ... your father ! And I 've always been proud of you . I wanted you to know that . And whatever I am , it 's because of what you taught me . Listen ... The world around us is in the throes of a great change and the new powers struggle with the old for domination
zone2	. So when my time comes , my body can be sent to the Gods ... in the old way , the way of fire and water . But you ... and your Queen are children of the old world , too . The Gods gave you wonderous powers . And you must fulfill your destiny together , wherever it leads you . I will bring my love with me to Xanten as my wife . I promise you . But you 're going to come with me ! I have no more travelling left in me . I 've hardly even breath anymore . There 's still so much for you to do , so many swords to make . My best blade is forged . There 's no need to bother with lesser one's . My throat is dry , son . That drink you said you were going to get me ... I could use that now . Of course , father . I 'll be right back . Father ? Father ! Animals die , people die , everyone on earth must die . But a
zone2	. My love , so near to my heart and my mind . And yet so far from my arms and my body . How much longer ? How much farther ? Yes ? My lady Kriemhild , may I please speak to you ? I wish to be alone , Lord Hagen . - It 's about Siegfried . What about him ? - I 'll expect him back any day . Of course he will come back ... for the treasure . - And not because of you ? What are you implying ? - I noticed your feelings for him . You speak of matters you know nothing about . I know , my Lady Kriemhild , that you have loved the dragonslayer ... since the first moment you saw him and I have come here to help you . Once the treasure is gone , there is nothing to keep him here . What is that ? - Certain herbs with interesting properties . Which if correctly brewed , will make a heart grow warm . That is wrong ! That is no Christian thing .
zone2	All he must do , is to drink this , mixed with wine and as long as ... it is you who gives him the cup , any love for any other woman ... would be forgotten , and only you will burn in his heart ... from that moment on . But why ... In battle and in council , I have always served the house of Burgund , and the best interests of the kingdom . WHAT HAPPENED UNTIL NOW My son ! - Go now ! Who are you , boy ? What happened ? I ca n't remember . Fire will rain down from the sky very soon . With the fire a man will come . The warrior 's strength will match your own . He will even best you in battle . Do you believe in destiny ? We were meant to meet . You 're the queen of Iceland ? - Yes . Does that make a difference ? No . Not to how I feel about you . I will love you forever . Do n't stare at the princess . -
zone2	Lord Hagen . Fafnir the dragon is awake . You must convince King Gunther to gather his best warriors and kill Fafnir . I too ask to join your quest against the dragon . That task is only for those warriors most honoured and favoured by the king . To the forest of Fafnir ! The dragon 's hide was hard as iron . Our weapons were useless against it . He will be revenged , my lady ! I swear it ! This gold is not for humankind . It belongs to us . That is the ring of the Nibelung , the oldest thing in the hoard . The one who possesses it , is the treasure 's owner . It comes with a curse ! Fafnir is the evidence . Heed our warning , or you too will pay . What sorcery 's this ? - The magical tarnhelm . With it you can wear any shape you desire . His name is Alberich , and he was one of us . But greed awoke in Alberich . He wanted the treasure all for himself . Like
zone2	the blacksmith killed the dragon ! Fafnir is dead ! I command that Eric , the blacksmith , be proclaimed a hero of the kingdom ! Even the honour of guarding the treasure would bring fame to Burgund , my lord , once it is known that you have been entrusted with the safety of the hoard . Defeat dragons with iron , but win maidens with gold ! My heart is pledged already . Would I know her ? - No . She lives far away . And I will marry no one else , Hallbera . Not a prince , not a king , not the Roman Emperor himself . I will bring my love with me to Xanten as my wife . But you 're going to come with me ! - I have no more travelling left in me . I 've hardly even breath anymore . They call me Erik , the blacksmith , Erik , the dragonslayer , and Erik , the hero of Burgund . I am Siegfried ! Son of Siegmund , king of Xanten . You 're beaten , and your
zone2	Xanten . I want him tied to the house of Burgund forever . My sister will marry Siegfried of Xanten . And I 'm sure you will not find this too difficult to arrange . What do you have in mind ? - One of your cantrips , spells , potions . If he could forget his other love , and ... find the princess attractive instead , then the gold stays where it is . So near to my heart and my mind and yet so far from my arms and my body . How much longer ? How much farther ? All he must do , is to drink this , mixed with wine . And as long as it is you who gives him the cup , any love for any other woman would be forgotten , and only you will burn in his heart from that moment on . 1 ' 500 years ago , most of Europe ... had abandoned its own believes and turned to the Christian faith . Only in the North did the people hold on to the Gods of their ancestors
zone2	He reigned among the stars in Valhalla , and his ravens ... gave him wisdom and memory . But whilst the fire of the ancient powers faded ... a wondrous tale arose , that captured the hearts of the people . It told of a blacksmith who slew a mighty dragon ... and won a legendary treasure : The dragon gold . King Siegfried of Xanten ! - I thank you for your hospitality . You were always welcome ! - I know that the treasure ... has brought you and your kingdom great misfortune and blood-shed , and for that I truly apologize . - Many wars are fought for gold ... and treasures . No army has ever waged war with a hero such as you among them . You did n't destroy lives ! You saved them . You 've done the kingdom of Burgund a great service . - Thank you , my king . King Siegfried , would you join us in a toast before you leave ? This is a special wine of Burgund , mixed with spices . To Siegfried of Xanten !
zone2	king ! To King Siegfried of Xanten . - To King Siegfried of Xanten . Good wine ... though the spices gave it a strange flavour . Where are Gunther and Hagen ? They left . Will you make it again for me some time , only with less cinnamon ? Of course , I will . But first I must confess something . - What ? At the dragon feast ... you told a masked girl that your heart was already pledged to somebody else . So it was you . Forgive me , I could n't say anything because ... - Please , it does n't matter , because I love you and I do n't know ... why it never occurred to me . - Nothing matters now , except that you love me , and I love you . Where might my raven be ? I 'm proud that Burgund has won you as brother-in-law . Nobody could bring more honour to our kingdom than you , Siegfried . I want to make your sister my queen before I return to my kingdom . Unfortunately in
zone2	marry before any of his siblings . - How long do we have to wait then ? It 's not that simple . The queen I desire is a beautiful and powerful woman who challenges ... her suitors to single combat . Till now , nobody has proved ... strong enough to defeat her . - And who is this powerful woman ? Her name is Brunhild . Queen of Iceland . I 've met her once . You know her ? Yes . Her ship sailed by our smithy one day . How could I forget ? She 's of extraordinary beauty . But you said you 've met her ? I did . That night a star fell from the sky ... into the forest near our smithy . We met by the crater it made , and we fought . But why ? I mistook her for a Saxon , and I wrestled her down . You mistook the Queen of Iceland for a Saxon ? How did she react ? She was a little surprised , that 's all . Siegfried , she is the woman
zone2	her for Burgund 's queen ? How ? By fighting her in my stead . Would n't she notice ? Not if you wear that magic helmet of yours . These powers should n't be abused . - Only you could defeat her . King Gunther has given you his only sister in marriage . Will you not help him win a queen for himself ? Think , Siegfried ... If I marry Brunhild , you and Kriemhild can be married the very same day . I knew what the wagons were carrying , when they came , but I had no idea it could look so beautiful . It 's yours . Mine ? The treasure is my wedding gift to you . But this ring ... is the symbol of our love . Wear it till I come back from Iceland . Every day without you will be an eternity . Come back soon . And bring my brother back safely . My king , we found a stowaway , hidden amidst the stores . Throw him over the side ! - I think you should see him
zone2	wanted to see the Norse women , the great Valkyries who fight like men ! Why , Giselher ? Do you want a warrior woman of your own ? Why did n't you ask me ? - I 've always asked you , and you 've always turned me down . - Your have to look after Burgund . And Kriemhild will be worried about you ! - Kriemhild knows . I 've half a mind to send you back ! - Oh , come on , Gunther . What boy does n't crave an adventure like this ? Sit down . And those are the Seven Silver Apples of the Goddess of youth . You know a lot ! - Not as much as my father Eyvind did . See over there , that 's Orwandil , the Giant , and next to it is Fearr , the bull that he hunts , and see there , that 's the Spirits ' Road , the Bright Road to Valhalla . The Gods sit up there with the holy dead , and decide what we should do to help them
zone2	they want ? - They send us signs . In water , fire , or in the sky . What happens if we read those signs wrong ? I do n't know . He 's coming , your future husband is coming ! Siegfried . Rise the sails . - Yes , sir . Rise the sails ! Welcome to my country , tamer of the fire and the elements . At last , you 've found your way to me . The dragonslayer 's fame reaches even here . It is not I who come to challenge you , great queen . It is King Gunther of Burgund who seeks your hand . I only serve him ! My queen ... I come here to seek your hand in marriage . We will fight a duel of double-bladed axes . If you win , I will wed you . If I win , it will cost you your life . If I fail to make you my wife , I will die gladly . The contest commences in one hour . Giselher . Let 's wait outside . Shadows
zone2	until it 's done . What about Siegfried ? He 'll follow us later . The dragonslayer does n't join you ? - He is already preparing the ship ... for our return . - The axes ! You can still sail back to Burgund alive ! Come on ! Here ! Come on ! Bow to my future husband . The king of Burgund , now the King of Iceland . Leave until I call you , and close the door . They make no sense , lady . Look there . That means a cloak or a mask . Something or someone ... has been hidden . The way truth is hidden by lies , or eyes are covered by a blindfold . Is that why Siegfried did n't recognize me ? There is nothing here . The Gods are silent . Ever since you came to Burgund in the guise of a humble blacksmith , many good things have happened in our kingdom . Now around this table are the two men I love most in the world . Giselher is my brother by birth , and
zone2	brother by blood . The dragon 's blood made my skin impenetrable . But I guess tonight is a night for trust . This is the only place where I can be wounded . And now both of you share the greatest secret I have . This cup will hold no lesser drink than the blood of brotherhood . It will be raised in no lesser toast . And may those who betray that trust , die dishonoured and accursed . People of Burgund ! Your Queen ! I present my sister Kriemhild . I 'll be a sister to you as well ! We will celebrate two weddings on one day . Where 's my tarnhelm ? I 'm not done with it yet . You can have it in due course . That was n't the deal , Hagen ! I 'm not sure if it worked . - It worked ! It worked ! And now you 're trying to cheat me . Perhaps I should find a way ... to have a little talk with the king . - No , no . No need for
zone2	Can I help you ? - I waited for you , as I said I would . Siegfried . What happened ? Did you find you could n't love a queen as well as you did a passing stranger ? Or was it the gold ? That has turned many hearts cold before . I do n't know . - Who shall I ask ... why you loved me then , and do n't love me now ? I did n't ... Do n't lie to me . You can not claim you did n't want me then ! It was your first time , blacksmith . And mine as well . And I knew then that the Gods had sent you to me ... and me to you . And you knew it too ! Does that mean nothing ? That 's not how I remember it . And you never loved me ? Even though you said you did . I was a boy then ... If this is what manhood brings , I only wish I 'd learned this lesson sooner , but it 's too late
zone2	will remember our love so little , because I will never know joy again ... till I forget or you remember . King Gunther , do you take Brunhild as your wife and queen ? I do ! - And do you , Brunhild , accept my king as your rightful husband and lord ? I do . Do you , Kriemhild , take Siegfried as your lawful wedded husband ? I do . - King Siegfried , do you take Kriemhild as your lawful wedded wife ? I do . I now pronounce you man and wife . This warlike display shows our Burgund swords ... and warriors at their finest . They could only be bettered ... by the great Queen Brunhild and the extraordinary King Gunther . Those few of us who were privileged to travel with King Gunther to Iceland , witnessed a display of incomparable skills . He was the only man who could match his beautiful queen in her challenge . Siegfried could . But Siegfried did n't . Would he like to try ? It would be an honour , Queen Brunhild .
zone2	forged from the same ore and have never been crossed . My spear ... and your sword ! Thank you for this chance to recognize my limits . What happened ? - I was tired . I decided to lie down . - That 's not what I meant . Why did you leave without me ? - Siegfried . Our fight in public . But you won ! - He let me win . That was not an honest victory . - He was lucky , that 's all . Maybe he gave up , so he would n't go to his marriage bed covered with bruises ! You 're the only woman I 've ever really wanted ! And do you have me ? Or do you ? You want me , my strong husband ? I 'm waiting . No more of this ! I 've drunk too much tonight to deal with such foolishness . The man who defeated me had n't drunk too much . - What ? Or then again maybe you had been drinking . Some magical potions to give you strength ,
zone2	a little secret : My strength is a gift from the Gods , and it lies in this belt . Once you 've removed it , you 'll find a yielding maiden in your arms ! Can the man who survived my challenge not survive his own wedding night ? Brunhild ! Well ! Stop ... Untie me ! Stop this ! Untie me ! Untie me right now ! Be quiet now ! - Wife , are you mad ? Let me loose ! Gunther is a lucky man . - Not as lucky as I am . Do n't you think Brunhild 's beautiful ? - What a question here and now ! Siegfried , answer me ! - Alright , yes . But it 's a hard beauty . You 've noticed it then ... - What ? That coldness . Well , she 's certainly angry about being defeated by Gunther . I do n't think she likes me much . Maybe because you won your husband without having to fight him . You hear that ? That 's Thor , swinging his hammer . Probably
zone2	will be conceived tonight ! Giselher . You do n't really believe in all this pagan nonsense , do you ? I do ! And so does Siegfried . And he 's the greatest hero Burgund has ever known ! I believe in what he does : In living life by the sword . And I 'm going to do the same . And when I die , I will be rewarded by sitting at the warriors ' table , next to Father Odin himself ! - You should hear yourself ! Do n't the old ways fascinate you ? - No , they do n't ! They scare me . The powers in it are uncontrollable , dangerous . Anyway , it 's not the way we were brought up . Lena . I did n't mean to hurt you . Brunhild , please do n't let the servants see me like this . I promise , I 'll never try to subdue you again . - Then let this be a lesson to you . I might be captive in this gilded cage , but I 'll never
zone2	the matter ? - Blood-brother , can I speak openly , and know you wo n't tell anyone else ? - Of course ! The queen ... We have n't ... I mean ... - What ? She wo n't let me into her bed . I 'm sorry . - And Burgund needs an heir . I must have a son ! If there was anything I could do , I would . But this is not a battle ... I can win for you . - Your strength is greater than hers ! And her strength does n't even come from her own body . It comes from her pagan belt . Now , if you could get it away from her ... No ! No , Gunther ! I 'm only asking you to take her belt , not ... substitute for me some other way ! You 'd refuse to help the man who gave you his own sister ? Your magic tarnhelm worked for us ... in Iceland , blood-brother . But if you do n't use it here tonight ... then all of that
zone2	... Shadows and vapours , all the same . Good night , my king . Lena ! You two go ahead ! I have to tell you something . - I love you , too . He just passed this way . Something very strange ... is happening here . I just want us to be happy together , to be man and wife . Look at you , my king . You are a match for me , are you not ? After all you defeated me in Iceland . Well , well . My king regains his steel ! Strange how it comes and goes without warning . Listen ! I do n't want to fight . I love you ! Prove it . That 's what I needed to know . Siegfried ? Now you can be my husband . Where are you going ? To get rid of this pagan witchery . And when I return , I expect you to be my wife . Do you swear to keep this secret ? In Iceland I saw two Gunthers too ! When my brother returned of
zone2	Gunther who arrived in the room . It was Siegfried . Gunther had been hiding in there all the time . I know it was n't my brother who defeated Brunhild . It was Siegfried ! Where have you been ? Kriemhild ! Why are n't you in bed ? - I woke up , and you were n't there . I could n't get back to sleep without you , so I waited . What 's that in your hand ? - Nothing important . Let me see . A woman 's belt ? Why try to hide it ? - It 's not what you think ! We 've only been married one day . All I can tell you is : Your brother needed me ! What for ? - That I can not tell you . Why not ? I promised not to . I swear before all the Gods , that I remain your true and faithful husband . So why wo n't you answer my questions ? What kind of help did my brother ... need from you that took you from your bed
zone2	woman 's belt in your hand ? If I told you , I would be breaking a vow of utmost secrecy . Break it . Open the doors for us , please . - I can not do that , my lady . Can not ? Why not ? - Orders from the queen . What ? No one may enter the church until the queen has done so . - Are you joking ? Open the doors ! - We can not , Lady Kriemhild . Brunhild , how dare you order the doors of this place closed to me ? I am the king 's own sister ! - And I am his wife , the queen ! It is only right that I should enter before any other lesser royals . Step aside now and let your queen pass ! - You 're no queen of mine , Brunhild ! And how dare you refer to my husband as lesser than anyone ? He even introduced himself in Iceland as Gunther 's servant ! He certainly served your husband well when he defeated you last night !
zone2	It was also my husband who conquered you in Iceland . You insult the Queen of Burgund in public with these lies ? So first I 'm a servant 's wife and now I 'm a liar ? Do you recognize this ? Who gave you that ? - My husband ! Do you believe me now ? He took it from you last night , in your own bedroom . It surprises me that you could n't tell . Now get out of my way . I do not get how you could reveal my and your brothers most intimate secret , in front of the whole of Burgund . Kriemhild , I only broke my vow because I counted on your discretion . I know . I am sorry . Please forgive me . I love you more than life , and now I 'm terrified ... that something awful will happen and somehow we 'll be parted . No more tears . In two days we 'll be far away from this place , from your brother ... and the complications of his marriage . - He
zone2	. He took advantage of your loyalty . But it 's over now . I 'll attend the hunt with him , and we 'll part as friends . Today I give orders for the gold to be loaded onto our ship . As soon as ... the hunt is done , we can be on our way . - Ca n't it be done any sooner ? Ca n't we leave immediately ? - I wish , but we can not give your brother the impression that we leave , bearing him ill will . I told you he was not to be trusted . - What justice can I ... possibly administer to put this right ? - The simple justice ... laid down in our books of law may not be sufficient in this case . He used magic to help you , it 's true . But what other use has he made of it ? You 've heard the people praise him more than you . Your brother-in-law has a legitimate claim to the throne of Burgund . What 's he planning next , my
zone2	of that hoard in my chamber would only bring me good ! Even if the queen gets a child by you , every tongue in Burgund will wag ... with the gossip that it 's really Siegfried 's bastard ! The kingdom is already ripe with this scandal . It wo n't go away . It will taint to you and your house ... till the end of your days unless something is done . I 'll end the alliance and send him away . Let him live out his days in Xanten . It 's not enough . You may not care if men scorn you as a weakling and a cuckold . But what about me ? I was betrayed by the dragonslayer and by you . I am the queen of Iceland and Burgund . I will not be dishonoured . I will be avenged . There is only one punishment fit for such a crime . What would you have me do ? It 's very simple . Siegfried must die . You ca n't mean it ! He 's my friend . More than my
zone2	shared ... a betrayal like that . I ca n't just have him killed ! - Either you will kill him ... or I will kill myself . My king , perhaps his punishment could come about " accidentally " ... at the hunt tomorrow . - You know Siegfried is invincible . And you know as well as I that he is not . King Siegfried , shall we ride together ? - May I join you as well ? I 'd be honoured ! Queen Brunhild ? Queen Brunhild , please let me talk to you . Our trouble has to be settled . Please , Queen Brunhild . I have something that 's rightfully yours which I must return . Indeed you have something that is rightfully mine . But it 's far too late to return it . You Christians make much of forgiveness . Do n't look for such in me . - I do n't , Queen Brunhild . All I can do is say how bitter my sorrow is for the way I treated you in front ... of the cathedral . I
zone2	be happening , I could n't bear it . Once I loved a man whom I thought the Gods themselves had sent me . I loved the whole world because he was in it . Long we were parted , but I could bear it ... because I knew he would return one day . But when he came again , it was as if his heart had been wiped clean . I loved him as I had , but he did not love me . We were strangers , as before we had been lovers . - Siegfried ? Siegfried . I have done you a terrible wrong . - Let 's speak no more about the church . I am not speaking of the cathedral . I speak of something far worse . What are you talking about ? You have done me no other greater harm . Once I loved a man who did not love me , and I could not bear it , for the world was an empty place without him . So when Hagen came to me with an unholy thing , that
zone2	new one there . I blinded myself to what was right , and gave it to that man to drink . It was Hagen 's magic . Siegfried never knew . Even if he did , there would be nothing ... he could do against it . That is my great sin against you , and him , and I will do penance for it for the rest of my life . So I 'm not the only one who got lucky . Well done , brother . Have a drink with us . - I 'll wash the blood up , first . Brunhild ... Is Siegfried not back ? - We should leave before dark . I 'll go and get him . Siegfried ? Siegfried ! No ! Help . Help ! Help ! Somebody help ! Arminius ! There was an ambush . A group of Saxons . Murderer ! How can you accuse me ? What reason would I have to kill a man who 's done us so much good ? Envy , and guilt , and greed ! With Siegfried dead , you
zone2	. And with him dead , you could keep the hoard for yourself ! All of it . The hoard ! I do n't want it anymore ! You always wanted the gold for yourself ! That 's why you slew him ! We planned it together ! You 'll never have the gold ! But the gold is my Nibelung birth right ! - You insolent son of a dwarf ! Keep out of this , boy ! He murdered our king ! I order you to arrest him ! Those who ally themselves with me , will be rewarded with gold " from the hoard " . And finally betrayed as he betrayed me ! Hagen of Tronje , face the fate my Gods have chosen ! Your Gods are dead ! - Soon we will know ! Return this ring to it 's rightful owner . Take it back to the Nibelungs . D-ave Day-yah fryn-dr . Dayre syolw-ra ith sama . Arminius . Today the old Gods live again ! No , Giselher . Today the old Gods will die with them

Don't-- Jeffrey . Oh . That 's nice for Jean-Paul . Well , oh , dear . Tsk . Bye-bye . Let 's go , sweetie . Sometimes it takes a great tragedy to make a man see his life clearly . I realize in my 29 years on this planet I have n't told you often enough how much I appreciate you . But you are all I have left in this cruel world . And I 'm not going to let anything come between us . - Oh ... . - Ever . - I love you
zone2	sweetie , love you . But you know what , honey ? We really have to get going , we 're late . I can see that my time is almost up . So I want to share with you one final story . On a beautiful morning in 1998 I went to my doctor for a routine colonoscopy . He ran some tests to make sure I did n't have cancer but I did . I tried every treatment known to Western medicine and some unknown to Western medicine . Whoo ! Ha-ha-ha . Nothing worked . I was told I was ... . I was told I was going to die in six months . That was six years ago . I beat cancer . How ? With my mind . I decided I was not gon na let some overactive clump of cells stop me from living my life . From that moment on , I realized I could have anything my heart desired . You can too . Remember , you are the author of your own life story . Why not make it a happy
zone2	, three , four ! - Son-of-a -- - Good morning , Jeffrey . That 's Mr . Mannus to you , and there 's nothing good about it . Jeffrey did you change the window display ? Sex sells , Seymour . Change it back , now ! I 'm putting Keith in charge of window displays . - What ? - I need someone I can count on . Seymour , how long have I been employed here ? Thirteen years . Yeah . And in all that time , have I ever missed a day of work ? Yes . More than any employee I ever had . There was the day your ant farm broke the day you lost your hat , the day you had a sore tongue . I ca n't do my job if I ca n't enunciate . Jeffrey , I like you . I liked your father , he was a good friend and a great Rotarian . But I need you to start taking this job seriously . Just behave or you 're fired . You know , positivity goes
zone2	for crying out loud , was a motivational speaker . - I mean , at his core . - I guess , yeah . - talk to him . I have n't done anything like that in years . What do I say to him ? Just ask him a question . You could ask him a follow-up about his colon . This is utterly ridiculous . I have a lot of work to do . I 'm just gon na -- Ask him anything , because here 's the point : You ca n't spend the rest of your Friday nights playing Scrabble with that son of yours . - I know . - You got ta dip your toe in the water . Somehow , some way , some dipping must occur . Stop talking about-- Okay , okay . - Calm down , relax . It 'll be easy . - Okay , I 'm mature . The third world 's a region I 'd like to get my hands on . - They could use some positivity . - Hi . - Hi . - Excuse
zone2	I do n't want to interrupt anything , of course , but I was wondering ... - ... if it 's all right if I ask you a question ? - Sure . Absolutely . Stem cells , that 's what I mean . It 's like , what do you think of the stem-cell research that 's going on today ? I 'm no expert , but I think if it helps the human race , go for it . Good . Good answer . Oh . Thank you . - Jan Mannus , right ? - Me . Yes , I 'm Jan . Associate Director of Human Resources . You are doing a hell of a job . Thank you for noticing . - Hmm . - Anyway ... . - Okay . - Do you like , uh , jazz ? Yes . - Do you ? - I love jazz . You lo - - ? Well , I play in a band and we gig on Friday nights at the Jazz Odyssey . Yes , I know that place . Do you ? Good
zone2	'd love to come with you . That 's the most wonderful invitation . - Thank you . - Terrific . But I 'm afraid I ca n't on Friday night . - I 'm sorry . What did you say ? - I said I ca n't make it Friday night . I 'm still not understanding you because the word " ca n't " is n't in my vocabulary . You see , Jan , we never regret the things in life we do only the things we don't . - I wrote that . - Ah . I do . I do , but you know what I mean , not like the whole " I do . " I mean , what I 'm saying is yes . I would like to go with you and listen to you play the jazz . - Hi , sweetheart . - What are you doing here ? I thought I 'd give you a ride home . Guess who I ran into yesterday ? Jennifer Cushman 's mother . Jennifer Cushman is apparently getting a divorce . -
zone2	be at the church 's single mixer on Friday so I thought you might wan na go . I have plans with you Friday night , remember ? Oh , right . Why are you so concerned about my personal life all of a sudden ? You have n't been on a date in three years , Jeffrey . I 'm concerned about -- Neither have you . Well , I got asked out today , and ... . - Pfft . Please . - What do you mean , " Please " ? Can you - - ? What is wrong with me getting asked out ? - You 're a middle-aged widow . - I 'm not that old . Not some trollop out of a Jackie Collins novel . There 's no reason to be absolutely ugly to me in front of people . I 'm trying to protect you . What if it does n't work out , like the last one ? I could n't bear to see you get hurt again . You know something , we never regret the things that we actually
zone2	n't do . So . Where did you get that pseudo-philosophical platitude ? - It does n't matter . - Dr . Phil ? Okay , that 's not funny . I think I 'm gon na go . Okay , fine . So . When is this date ? - Friday night . - What ? That 's Putt-Putt night . But I said I was sorry . - Well , I 'm afraid sorry wo n't do . I know , I know , sweetheart . What if I make your favorite , huh ? What do you think ? Little bitty ? No ! You ca n't win back my affection with Manwich . This has been the worst day of my life . I 'm going to my room . Did you do something to your hair ? I cut it . A little garish , but not altogether unattractive . - Really ? - What 's the occasion ? Well , I have a date tonight , remember ? Oh , yes , right , of course . The bitter sting of rejection 's coming
zone2	goodness , here it is . Well , have a nice day . - Are n't you forgetting something ? - What ? It comes in a brown paper sack , and rhymes with my lunch . I just did n't have time to make it this morning . Why ca n't you just grab yourself a little sandwich or something ? All right , honey ? Bye-bye , bye-bye . There you go . Can I help you ? Yes . Do you have anything that 's not utterly repugnant ? No . Okay . Fine , give me three biscottis two chocolate chip fudge brownies and one of these giant Rice Krispie abominations . Maybe a heart attack will teach my mother ... - ... a lesson in abandonment . - Maybe . Biscotti . That 's a cool store . It 's actually got some character , unlike those lame mega-chains . Do you like working there ? It 's paying the bills until I make my first astronomical discovery . You 're an astronomer ? That 's cool . I 'm a singer , actually .
zone2	that I write are about how corporate America 's totally screwing up our culture . I 'm calling my first album " Bed , Bath and Bullshit . " So ... . I actually do a show here every Saturday . It 's not sappy . You know , my songs are n't about love or anything . They 're about how much I hate corporations . So , anyway , that will be 10.76 . For stale bread and cereal ? That 's obscene . I know . The guys who own this place are a bunch of poser A-holes . So ... . But I 'll give you my employee discount if you want . It 's 10 dollars even . All right , here you go . Well , take it easy . Here . This is redeemable for a free book . Not including first editions or new releases ... - ... or fiction . - Thanks . Or non-fiction . It 's -- We -- Woo . Oh . Thank you . Thank you very much for coming out to the Jazz Odyssey tonight .
zone2	it to a very special lady ... - ... in the audience tonight . - Oh -- Do you mind if I say this ? I just ca n't get over what a great singer you are . I mean that . Well , Nat King Cole , that 's a great singer . I 'm just a wannabe . You know something ? I disagree . To me , I think that you could have your own Christmas special even . Thank you . That 's very kind . Actually , music is just another hobby for me . Kind of like golf and horseback riding and archery . And wine making . - Of course , puppetry . - Oh . My goodness . I just do n't even understand how you find time for all of it . I think we always find time for the things that are important to us . Do n't we ? What 's important to you ? - Me ? - Yeah . Oh , my goodness . Well ... . Unless I 'm being too personal , because I do
zone2	I just have n't thought about what 's important to me in a really long time , so ... . Well , maybe it 's time you start . What a wonderful evening I had . - You are so nice . - Well , thank you , I did too . Would you like to maybe do it again ? - You mean go out again ? - Yeah . I mean , my God , you 're beautiful , you 're smart , and ... . Plus , you like my singing , so there 's that . Seriously , though , I think being a single mother is the most noble thing that anyone could ever do . It takes strength and fortitude to raise a well-adjusted child who is prepared to go out and take on the world and I think what you 've done is just terrific . - You know something , Mert ? - Yeah . - I have to be completely honest with you . - Mm-hm . My son lives with me . Oh . He 's still in school ?
zone2	. He should have his own place hands down . But , you know , the thing is we made a big agreement . That he could live at home until he makes ... - ... his first astronomical discovery . - Oh . Astronom-- Wow , that 's - - Boy , that sounds ambitious . - Yeah . - I 'd love to meet him . Sure , of course . But you 're not talking about now , right ? No , yeah , because he 's not actually here . - It could be another time . - Okay . Another time , well , good . Well , listen , I 'll call you . - Oh , okay . - All right . Sure . Do that . Whoa . Ha-ha . - Oh , boy . - Good night . Good night . Jeffrey ? That 's my name , do n't wear it out . Well , what are you doing up ? Where did you say you were again ? I told you , sweetie . I was out with Barbara
zone2	- Hah ! Her son told me he was with her all night . You 've been cavorting around with that Mert character , have n't you ? - Oh , tough . - I knew it . Have you had sex with him ? - I 'm not going to answer that . - You have . Oh . I hope you used a condom . I 'm sure he has herpes . Oh ! - I want you to meet him . - Forget it . No ! If you wan na skulk around behind my back with some VD-ridden sex maniac who keeps you out until all hours of the night , that 's your business . - But I want nothing to do with him . - Ca n't you just make this easier on me for once , Jeffrey , and meet him ? I 'm sorry , but the answer is no . Come on , sweetie . We can go to Putt-Putt . Hmm ? Hmm ? So , Mert . You ever been married before ? I was married once . -
zone2	No . Why do you hate children ? Well , actually , my wife had ovarian cancer . Would you call yourself a religious man ? I 'm agnostic . - Do n't believe in God , I guess ? - That 's an atheist . How many pieces of string would it take to connect the Earth to the moon ? One , if it were long enough . Go ahead , just -- - So , we can just -- Yeah , bend over . Come on . I know . Just bend over . Excuse us for just a second . - Hit it softer . Yeah . - Yeah ! - Okay , all right , okay . - Oh . Okay . - Not bad , huh ? Go ahead , Jeffrey . - Thank you , Mert . Show us how . Well , you know , I play a little bit , so ... . - Come on , Jeffrey . Show us how . - Yes , Jeffrey , yes . Here you go , Jeffrey . Ah ! Oh ! -
zone2	Hats off , Jeffrey . - Outstanding . - Oh , my . It 's called a triple ricochet , Mert , and it took me years to perfect . Is n't this so much fun ? You know what , sweetie ? You know what we could do ? We could-- Maybe next time you could bring a date , and we could play doubles . You know dating is not an option for me given the lack of privacy I have in the house . Honey . Oh ! Look what he did . - Yes ! Ha-ha . - Ho ! Ho-ho ! Beginner 's luck . That 's all that was . - Oh . I know ! - That 's just-- How impressive is that ? Well , I read the break . That 's what I did . Well , what do you know , Jeffrey . We 're tied at 29 . I could live with that . Naturally , you 'd be content with mediocrity , Mert . I , on the other hand , play to taste the savory thrill of
zone2	Your mom 's waiting in the car . She 's a little bit worn out from having played for five hours . Ho ! Ha-ha ! Should have gone with a tie , son . Ha-ha-ha . - Oh . Tough luck there . - No , that 's a do-over . Official rules state I 'm eligible for another turn . Oh-- Got it . He 's entering the third stage of shock right now . I got ta get out of here . I have very fragile -- - Give me your hand , son . - I ca n't . It 's cutting deep into my flesh . I think I can feel the blood . - It 's a dull blade , sir . There 's nothing there . - No , give me some gauze . - I need some gauze . Come on , give me a hand . Push . - Push ? I 'm not giving birth here . - Chuck , get the Jaws of Life . Mert ? If you can hear me , I get another shot . Mert
zone2	? Did you - - ? What did you - - ? What did you think of Mert ? I mean , did you - - ? I 'm sorry . I ca n't give you my blessing . He simply does n't have your best interest at heart . I suggest you break it off with him via e-mail he may react violently if you do it in person . Morning , gang . - Hi , M-mert . What are you doing here ? Uh ... . Have n't you told him yet ? - Told me what ? - Well ... . - Well ... . - Well Jeffrey , your mother and I have made a decision . You 're never going to see each other again ? - No . - No , no . No , no , no , sweetheart , no , no . Actually , what 's happening is that Mert is going to kind of like kind of , sort of move in , around the house a little bit , you know ? Kind of like on a temporary
zone2	and kind of -- Oh , God . Mert , move in . Like , with us , and ... . Well , we wan na ... . We want to know how you feel . Jeffrey ? Can I speak to you in private , please ? Obviously you 're upset . Of course I 'm upset . I was n't even consulted , for Pete 's sake . I 'm so sorry . It 's just that the last six weeks have been a whirlwind and -- What was all that about you wanting my opinion ? You do n't care about what I think . Of course I care what you think , you 're my son . I love you more than anything in the world and Mert 's moving in is n't going to change that one iota . Now , I know this is an adjustment , but you know what I think ? I think you 're gon na enjoy having a man around the house . I am a man around the house . Fixed the sink . The p-trap collar nut
zone2	Now for the first time ever you can make homemade sausage and homemade pasta as easy as one , two , three . Look , I know we sprung this on you a little bit abruptly so I do n't blame you if you feel angry . That 's an authentic emotion . I encourage you to go ahead and experience it . But just so you know I do n't wan na replace your father , and I ... . Ha . Heh . I do n't expect you to call me dad . But I do have one request , and that is that you just give me a chance . You 're a good kid , Jeffrey . I 'd like to be your friend . You know only those who risk going too far can possibly find out how far they can go . Hmm . I wrote that . Mitch , I need your help . Sorry , Jeffrey . We stopped selling interactive porn . No . I want you to do some hacking for me . His name is Merton Jacob Rosenbloom and
zone2	him . - Fifty bucks . - That 's ridiculous . You 're ridiculous . I 'll give you 25 dollars and a Warburtons discount card . Great choice , sir . One of our most popular games . Good , good . It 's a gift for my girlfriend 's son . - Cash or charge ? - Charge . Wai -- You 're Merton J . Rosenbloom ? That 's right . Heh . I might have some information about your girlfriend 's son you want to know . Really ? What - - ? What is it ? Hey ! Hey ! You remember me ? - Remember ? - Oh , yeah . You want a ride ? Yeah , then when I was like 17 , my dad was all : " Get rid of the tattoo or get out of the house . " So like , I 've been on my own ever since . Why do n't you have a car ? I have severe carpal tunnel syndrome . Well , thanks for the ride . - It was nice of you

You know how sensitive my joints are to moisture . Now , it 's perfectly dry down there , and guess what . Guess what we did . We put in the old TV and VCR down there so it 's gon na be like your own bachelor pad . Honey ? Oh , sweetheart . - Would you just please go away ? - Hey , buddy .

Who 's headed for the bedroom ? - Oh , Mert . Oh , Mert . Oh , honey . - Oh ! Oh ! Your thighs are like a bear trap . - Ugh ! Oh ... . Oh ! And everything 's sponsored By huge corporations What will be next ? A Del Taco space station This corporate culture Just sucks out our brains While the corporate vultures Eat our remains From Wolfgang Pucks to Family Feud It all sucks and we 're all screwed There 's no way to escape From the corporate rape And this world that we 're living in Is headed for oblivion

Where 's Allison ? Actually , Allison and I just broke up . Long distance relationships are impossible to maintain . I hear that . I guess I 'll see you around . Wait a minute . I want to apologize for being so brusque earlier . Whatever . Uh-- Wait . I want to make amends . Let me buy you a cup of coffee or something . It 's been a really long night , I do n't think so . You would be doing me a colossal favor . See , I ca n't go home right now because my mother is having violent sex with her new lover . - Okay . One cup of coffee . - Waitress ! No ! God , no , not here , the coffee sucks
zone2	Trip . He was the last guy I dated . And he had this band called the Taco Shits . And he wrote all , like , these really poetic , beautiful songs . And then I found out that he stole them all off the Internet . And I was like , " Oh , that 's so lame . " And that 's why I hate this city , you know ? Because it 's all a bunch of posers . And I just feel like as soon as I get enough money I am gon na get out of here because I ca n't stand it anymore . - Do you wan na sit here ? This good ? - Oh , sure . Well , where are you gon na go ? I think I 'm gon na go to Austin , Texas . I wan na check it out . It 's got this really , really cool indie music scene there . Have you been there ?

It 's my cross to bear . Well , that really sucks that you have to live at home . Well , at least it affords me the financial freedom to pursue my life 's work . For the last seven years , I 've been tracking what I believe to be a long-period comet which emanates from the Oort cloud . That 's cool . Oort . What 's up , Nora ? What do you want , Trip ? - I 'd like a tall latte , extra hot . - Heh-heh-heh . - That 's a good one , Trip . - Ha-ha-ha . Yes , Trip . Very clever . I 've seen you before . You work at that bookstore , right ? Yes , I do . Well , that 's messed up , bro . That place is , like , old and shit . Wow

Get a napkin , stat . I think I may be a hemophiliac . So is your nose okay ? I think that barbarian broke it . Hey , cool . Whose hybrid ? That 's my mother 's beau du jour . This is Mert again . - Speak of the devil . So call me , please . Do n't look at him , you 'll turn to stone . - Hey there . Oh ! - Hi . What happened to your nose , Jeffrey
zone2	. What are you guys doing out at this hour anyway ? Is n't it a little past your beddy-bye time ? Gee , it 's hard to imagine why I 'd wan na leave all the luxury and comfort of my dungeon . What are you doing outside on the phone ? - Hi , I 'm Mert . - Hey , I 'm Nora . What do you do , Nora ? - Well , I work in a coffeehouse -- - Nora is an aspiring iconoclast . - And she was just leaving . - Hey . Would you like to join us Saturday ? We 're having a family picnic . - No , we 're not . - Actually , we are . I decided to do something special for your mother 's half-birthday . You must 've forgotten . I am far too busy to keep track of fractions of people 's birthdays . And anyway , I 'm sure Nora does n't have the time nor the desire to subject herself to that kind of horror . Well , actually , I 'd
zone2	What are you guys gon na do now ? I do n't know . You must be Nora . I 'm Jan . - Hi . - Hi . Nice to meet you . Oh , God , you have no idea how happy I am to meet you . Words can not express it . Ooh . - Welcome . - Thank you . Oh , my goodness , look at you . All right now , listen , Mert is out back on grill duty . Jeffrey 's getting dressed . Jeffrey ! Jeffrey ! That 's Jeffrey . Look at him . Little fat butterball . You could just eat that little face right up , could n't you ? He was really big . Oh , he was huge . Yeah , I mean , he was a month late . And so , eventually they had to induce labor and it was kind of a battle . The doctor had to use forceps , and it was kind of like a tug-of-war , you know ? Because every time they 'd get Jeffrey 's head
zone2	. This went on for just hours and hours and finally , they had to inject a mild tranquilizer into his skull and then he kind of slid right out after that and ... . Jeffrey , honey . Nora 's here ! That 's John . That 's Jeffrey 's dad . He was in the Rotary club . Anyway . Oh-- See this ? Jeffrey is 12 years old , and that 's right after he got back from Austin . He went to an astronomy convention when he was 12 ? No . He went to a fat farm . Who 's ready for a picnic ? - These ribs are delicious . - Mmm . Thank you , Nora . - Mert is a magician with meat . - Oh . - Ha-ha . - Oh . Do you have any more barbecue sauce ? - Oh , yes , of course we do . - In the ... . - Did you bring this , Mert ? - No . It 's addressed to you . Why do n't you open it , Mert ?
zone2	, open it . All right . Oh . What is frontierism ? Actually , I think it 's pronounced frotteurism . It 's a deviant sexual behavior in which the frotteur becomes sexually aroused by rubbing his genitals against others in public places . - Oh . - I read about it on the Internet . Do you subscribe to that magazine , Mert ? Actually , I do . I have a client who is a frotteur . He 's having a difficult time overcoming his problem and I thought if I could understand what it was like to be a frotteur ... - ... I 'd be better prepared to help him . - Oh . I mean , he is ... . He is such a good kid , darn it . Tsk . I just wan na help him get past this , you know ? Live up to his full potential . That 's really cool . Thrilling is what it is . Well ... . Moving . So , Nora . Did you study music in college ? - I took a couple
zone2	to the Lunar Space Institute in Austin . Really ? How was that ? - Jeffrey did n't exactly finish . - I cut my college experience short to save my mother the trauma of empty nest syndrome , Mert . Cut it short , Jeffrey ? No , no . Remember ? You showed me your dorm room and you made me take you home . It was like a prison cell . And did you see who would 've been my roommate ? All covered in tattoos and piercings . I 'm sure he and his friends would 've gotten intoxicated one night and sodomized me . Jeffrey . Sometimes we confuse our fears with our fantasies , Jeffrey . I myself loved college . Getting away from my parents , being on my own in Berkeley . I mean , it was a very exciting time . Mm . Heh . Berkeley in the ' 60s ? Must have been very exciting . All you hippies shooting up acid and snorting LSD . I mean , I might have smoked a little pot , but who has
zone2	have I . Because drugs are wrong . I tend to agree . Well , that was a long time ago . Nora ? Do you make a living as a singer ? Well , that 's the dream . What 's holding you back ? I 'm just trying to save up enough money so I can record a demo . But I ca n't afford it right now . I'm-- I 'm sorry , what did - - ? What did you say ? I said I ca n't afford it . No , see , I still do n't understand you because the word " ca n't " is n't in my vocabulary . You see , Nora , I believe that if you really want something in life you got ta go after it . You ca n't let anything hold you back . - You just said " ca n't . " Uh-uh-- Mm . Jeffrey , please , just be quiet . I do n't get it . I mean , how am I supposed to record a demo if I do n't have
zone2	to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams . Lightning bolt . Lightning bolt . Lightning bolt . Lightning bolt . Lightning bolt . Have pity , Gallantar , I 'm but a simple Mage . - Silver . Silver . Silver . - Stop , I 'm dead , Gallantar ! - Enchanted . Enchanted . - Stop , Gallantar ! Time freeze ! Ow ! Get off me . Get off . He called time freeze , Gallantar . That means stop ! I 'm the game master , Rathkon . I get to call the shots around here . You hit me in the forehead . I have a deposition tomorrow and I 'm gon na look ridiculous . What 's wrong with you , Gallantar ? Sorry , Alhorn , my old friend . I 've brought my troubles from home to the battlefield . The boyfriend ? You must confront this enemy head on , Gallantar . For your own sake , and for the sake of the Land of Erdreja ! Ahh . How do you like thine grog ? It 's
zone2	yeah , I mean , my parents locked the liquor cabinet , so I ... . It 's got a lot of sugar in it , though , so ... . How may I help you elves ? I 'm looking for Mert Rosenbloom . Why , are you trying to steal the magic orbs ? I 'll call you back . Wrong cord . - What 's up , Lancelot ? - Your time in my life is up . My mother 's not big enough for the two of us . I 'm sorry , Ace . I love her , and I 'm not leaving . Well , I 'm not leaving either . You know , Jeffrey , it does n't have to be this way . I hereby throw down this gauntlet . That sounds like glass . You 're gon na pay for that . War is hell , old man . Yes , it is . And you 're going down . That 's a promise , son . See you on the battlefield . Do n't call me son . So then
zone2	Oh . You wan na go to Comic-Con ? It 's important to always create a kind of positive atmosphere in the work home . And when I say " work home , " I mean a place where you can have a warm , kind of comfortable relaxing , kind of ... . You know , an environment where people really enjoy what they 're doing , and it 's -- It 's the kind of ... . It 's the kind of thing that does n't have -- Goddamn it ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh . Mert ? Uh-huh ? What is this ? It looks like a bong . Hmm . With some pot . That 's what I thought , but you said you do n't do drugs anymore . - I don't . - Well , then where 'd this come from ? Actually , the truth is I do smoke a little pot , once in a while . - Oh . - Jan ? It 's not that , you know ... . Honesty is very important to me , Mert .
zone2	. Oh ... . Hey , hey . Are you okay ? What 's the matter ? Is it about Mert ? Did you discover something about him that you did n't know before ? Well , I discovered that Mert smokes pot because he has glaucoma but that 's not actually it . Wait , then why are you crying ? I 'm crying because Mert and I are gon na get married . Look . Ha-ha . Grab a glass . Let 's celebrate , huh ? You 're gon na be a Rosenbloom . - Come on , baby , let 's dance . - Oh , Mert , no , I 'm too embarrassed . - Oh , no . Come on , come on , come on . - Ah , sweetie , oh , please . Oh , Mert . Oh , ha-ha-ha . Mm . Oh , you 're so snappy , pappy . Ooh . How 's that ? I feel like I 'm on a subway . Mert , what do you say ? Ha-ha-ha . We got one other piece

No , of course it 's your home , naturally but Mert and I are starting a new life and we want our own home so that we can make new memories . New memories . Brand-new memories , Jeffrey . Well , I hate to rain on your parade but I refuse to give my consent on the sale of this house . Well , I do n't need your consent because the house is in my name . Okay . Fine . Let 's assume for a moment that 's true . What about me ? Where do I fit into this new house equation ? Well , we 're looking at smaller places . Yeah , condos and whatnot . So ... . Yeah . No , but you can come and sleep in the hideaway bed whenever you come for ... - ... like , a little visit . - Yeah , but ,

Fine . You two obviously do n't want me here anymore so maybe I 'll just get out of your hair tonight . Jeffrey , no . Yeah . Mert . Hey . Thank goodness you 're home . I 'm in desperate need of a Yoo-hoo . I have this nasty infestation of vermin at my house which I ca n't seem to exterminate and it 's causing my gastritis to flare up . Yoo-hoo 's the only beverage that seems to soothe it . How do you know where I live ? I bribed one of your associates with a discount card . Well , unfortunately , I 'm fresh out of Yoo-hoo . I see you still listen to Morrissey . Yeah , well , a lot of his new stuff 's really good . Really ? I would n't know .

Marijuana ? ! I 'm sorry , I say no to drugs and so should you . - Are you joking ? - No . Not only is it illegal , I 'm sure it contains any number of unknown toxic substances . But go ahead and " trip out " or whatever it is you hippies do . I 'll just sit here and monitor you for safety purposes . Well , it 's a good thing you 're here . You 're kind of a freak .

I 'm irreplaceable . I 'm replacing you with Keith . Do n't do this to me , all right ? I love this old bookstore . Here 's your severance check . I gave you my youth , Seymour . - If you need a reference , I 'd be happy to -- - Burn in hell , old man !

Mert does n't really seem like the cheating type . - They never do . - So , what do you need me for , anyway ? Why do n't you just show those emails to your mom ? Uh-uh . Too circumstantial . We need definitive evidence . Nothing must be left to chance . Now , come on , let 's go . Jeffrey ! I 'm in the middle of recording my demo . Nora , time is not our friend at the moment . My mother 's gon na marry that philanderer if we do n't do something right now . Please . I 'm just trying to do what 's best for my mother . I could really use your help . Arizona ? Hey . Hey . I 'm gon na stop , okay ? Stop where ? I do n't know . I was thinking we could camp out tonight . You know , under
zone2	in the back . Camp out ? I do n't wan na be raped by some sex-crazed trucker . Come on . Why do n't you drive ? For real . I know about fat camp . It 's okay . I was a chunky kid too . Believe me , I know exactly what you went through . It 's awful . Just be honest with me . I 'm afraid to drive because my father was killed in a car accident . Okay ? I 'm sorry . - This is pretty great , huh ? - Oh , yeah . If you consider great having a sciatica flare-up while being eaten alive by mosquitoes . Do n't be such a baby . I ca n't believe you 've never been camping before . I 've been camping . Just never without adult supervision . My father took me once when I was 10 . Actually , that 's the first time I heard the seductive song of the astronomy siren . That 's cool . My dad was too busy getting hammered and puking on his shoes
zone2	feel so insignificant out here . Do n't you ? Sometimes . But then other times I feel totally connected to the universe like a part of something greater than myself , or even this planet . That despite what happens to all of us when we shuffle off this mortal coil the universe will still be here . That was beautiful . Yes , well , I 'm paraphrasing Leonard Nimoy , of course . Are you okay ? What do you mean ? Your teeth are chattering . They are ? Are you cold ? Not particularly . Is that a permanent retainer ? - Yeah . - I have one too . See ? They say you 're supposed to keep it in for life , you know ? Well , that 's what my orthodontist said . Hey . So ready to go ? - Hold on ! - Come on . Jeffrey ? Jeffrey , what are we doing ?

Me , sick ? You 're the one having an affair with a man who 's engaged to another woman . Mert Rosenbloom is not my lover , you psycho . He 's my father . The last time I saw Mert , I was 12 years old . He dropped me off for soccer practice one day and never came back . At the time , my mom told me that he just was n't ready to be a father . And when I was older , she told me that he suffered from depression . He started emailing me a couple years ago telling me that he 'd turned his life around and that he 'd become some sort of motivational speaker . Actually , I think he prefers the term " success coach . " He said that he met this really great
zone2	when I did n't respond , I guess he just figured he 'd rather say he did n't have any kids than admit that he 'd messed up so bad . Maybe I should have responded . I do n't know . I guess I just never figured out a way to forgive him . We 're here . Well , I feel sorry for the poor guy . But the truth must be revealed . Wait a minute . You still want your mom to break up with him ? The man lied to her , Nora . - He was ashamed . - A lie is a lie . Ugh . Wait a minute . So you 've never told a lied before ? Absolutely not . That 's a lie right there . Remember fat camp ? That 's different . What about Allison ? What about her ? I know there is no Allison . Mert told me all about it . And you believed him ? The man will stop at nothing to bring me down . Do n't you see ? That 's what
zone2	from that monster . You 're not trying to save your mom , you 're trying to sabotage her because you 're too afraid to grow up . And I was just a pawn in your sick little plan . You were not a pawn . You were an essential component . An essential component ? Is that what you think of me ? Yeah . What 's wrong with that ? You 're such an asshole . Get out . - Okay , Nora , I 'm sorry . I did n't mean that . - Get out ! Morning , Jeffrey . Oh , Mert . That 's my name , do n't wear it out . What are you doing up ? Cut the bullshit . I know where you 've been , and you should n't have gone there . Well , you should n't have told Nora about Allison . Stay away from me , you maniac . I 'll call the police . Go ahead . It 'll be over by the time they get here . I 'll scream . My mother 's

Huh ? - He started it . - I did not . - Did too . - I did not ! - Did too . - I did not ! Stop ! Will somebody please in God 's name , tell me what is going on here ? Mert lied to you , Mother . He has a daughter , and I have proof . Mert , what is he talking about ? Well , I mean-- I was -- I was going to-- I was going to tell you . Okay , forget it . Forget it . Here . You can take your ring back , Mert
zone2	take it . I am not -- - Jan , I am not-- I am not taking the ring . - And good luck . - Jan , your son -- - Do n't talk to me like that . Do n't you dare say that about my son ! Okay , that 's it , Mert . I 've had it ! Put him on a leash ! I know it was n't easy for you to break it off with him , Mother but take comfort in the fact that you did the right thing . No one should have to cohabitate with a liar . Oh , and I was thinking that maybe for dinner tonight we could do something special . Jeffrey ? I want you to move out . What ? You have two weeks , Jeffrey , to find your own place . I 'm sorry . No , I 'm not leaving . You ca n't make me . Yes , I can , Jeffrey . All right , fine , I 'm sorry . I 'll be better . I promise .
zone2	, look , you 're in a state of shock , you do n't know what you 're saying . I know exactly what I 'm saying . Now , please let go of me . Let go of me . Fine . You want me to leave ? I do n't need your pity fortnight . I 'll leave right now . But I want you to know you 're right . This is all your fault . That I turned out this way , that you used me to replace Dad . Oh . Oh . Oh , dear . Here . What do you want ? Actually , I 'd like an application for employment . I 'm looking for work , and I recalled you mentioning that the benefits package here was respectable . Hey , Richard , can you bring this guy out an application ? The manager will be right with you . Hey , if you wan na just fill this out for me right there -- So how are things ? Can you cover for me ? I 'm gon na take
zone2	me the opportunity to explain . Okay , but what 's to explain ? That you 're an immature man-child who used me in your demented plot to squeeze your mom 's boyfriend out of her life so that you could win her back ? Oh , yeah , and your long-distance girlfriend is imaginary . Does that about wrap it up there ? You 're sick , bro . It sounds a lot worse when you string it all together like that , Richard . - You ca n't go back there . - Nora ! Do n't even bother filling out that application . Where 's your car ? I sold it . I 'm taking a bus to Austin next Sunday . Nora , please . Give me another chance . Why ? You do n't care about me . You do n't care about anybody . Do you have any idea how much pain you caused your mom ? Do you ? All she wanted was a life , and you went and you messed it up because you 're too afraid to live your own
zone2	that to me . I 'm chasing my dream . I 'm taking my shot , okay ? And if your mom knew what was good for her , she would too . And she 'd kick you out of that goddamn house . She did . Oh . So , what ? I guess you need a place to crash ? God , you 're so pathetic . Mm . Nummy-num-nums . Ahh . Come on . Thanks for coming . I hope we can let bygones be bygones . I just spent 500 dollars to get you out of jail . Then we 're off to a good start . Well , now , as you know , there is n't much room . - And there 's only one bed . - All right . Are you sure you 're gon na be okay sleeping on the floor ? I was thinking you would sleep on the floor . I 've got spina bifida . I 've got osteoporosis . Well , I 'm allergic to dust . I 'm 91 fucking years old . Seymour ,
zone2	What are you doing in my bed ? Do you think there 's any way for me to make redress for the things I 've done ? It 's 4:00 in the morning . I need to know , Seymour . Can I be redeemed for all the suffering I 've caused ? If you 're looking for some wise , pithy bit of advice that only an old man with a lifetime of experience can give you you 're barking up the wrong tree . What I can tell you is the love we give away is the only love we keep . That 's actually wise and pithy , Seymour . I got it off an old Deepak Chopra calendar . I think it was September . Wake up , old man . What in the name of Mike is going on ? I have a plan ... - ... to restore order to the universe . - Huh ? I 'm getting my mother back together with Mert . You 're wearing my suit . Slow down ! I do n't know how ! " My dearest
zone2	incredibly successful schedule to think about recent events , and I 've come to a conclusion . I was wrong . Yes , I , Mert , the meat magician , screwed up . I just want you to know that I 'm sorry , and I know that Jeffrey is sorry . What he did was selfish and childish . He was afraid to live his own life , afraid that by sharing you he would lose you but he loves you and he wants us to be together . Please , meet me at Brentfield Park tomorrow at 3 . All my love , Mert . " " Dear Mert , you 're right . Jeffrey should be on a leash . Meet me at Brentfield Park tomorrow at 3 . Love , Jan . " Yes ! Damn it , where is she ?

Jan , no , wait , wait , wait . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Look , I know I should 've come clean about everything but I just - - I was afraid I was gon na lose you . That sounds like an excuse , but it 's not , it 's true . Look , I ... . I have been in love with you since the first moment I saw you . Bingo . What ? Damn it ! Ca n't they do anything right ? What 's happen - - ? What ? Oh ! Oh . Oh , my God . Lovely day for a stroll . Leave me alone , okay ? - Come on , give Mert another chance . - What ? Look , I know I have

For everything I 've done . - Since when ? - Since you met Mert . - But what about before that ? - What are you referring to ? Well , I am referring to the fact that you have n't been honest with me a day in your life , Jeffrey . - And you 've been honest with me ? - No , I have not and it just makes me absolutely sick . To think that our whole entire relationship has been based on a foundation of lies and self-deception -- This is no time for a trip down memory lane . It 's not about us . It 's about you and Mert . It 's all about us . It 's all about where we went wrong . - Do n't you walk away from me , young lady . - Do n't you talk to me like that , young man . I

I may be forced to litigate . - Move this vehicle or I 'm calling the cops . - I refuse to move an inch , sir until the young lady agrees to come with me . Oh , my God . - You 're insane . - No , I 'm not . I made a backup copy . Look , Nora , you were right . I was an asshole . I 'm sorry about the way I treated you . It 's just because I liked you so much . What are you talking about ? You 're smart , you 're intrepid , you 're " funky . " I was just so terrified of being hurt I could n't admit it . But I 'm not afraid anymore . Now I 'm late , asshole . Move that piece of shit . - Come make me , you philistine ! Ah ... . Can you give me a chance ? Come with me ? Get out of the way

I like riding around the trains . Takes my mind off things . All unpleasant to be old , is n't it ? The tale is thrilling , if I say so myself . But now is not the time to tell it . Take my arm .

That 's why he 's returning to Hogwarts . And it 's crucial he should return . I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you , Harry . She was truthfully ... very pretty . The girl .

How old is he ? 150 ? Give or take a few years ? Cissy , you ca n't do this ! He ca n't be trusted . The Dark Lord trusts him . The Dark Lord is mistaken . Run along , Wormtail .

Every day , every hour , this very minute , perhaps ... dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle 's walls . But in the end , that greatest weapon ... is you . Just something to think about . Now off to bed , beep beep . That was cheerful . History of Magic is upstairs , ladies , not down . Mr . Davis , Mr . Davis , that is the girls ' lavatory . Potter . Oh , this ca n't be good . Enjoying ourselves , are we ? I had a free period this morning , Professor . So I noticed . I would think you would want to fill it with Potions . Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror ? Well , it was , but I was told to have to get an Outstanding in my O.W.L . So you
zone2	, Professor Slughorn 's perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T . students with " Exceeds Expectations " . Brilliant , um ... Well , I 'll head there straight away . Oh , good , good . Potter , take Weasley with you . He looks far too happy over there . I do n't want to take Potions . There 's Quidditch trials coming up , I need to practice . Attention to detail in the preparation is the prerequisite of all plan . Harry , my boy , I 've been beginning to worry . You brought someone with us , I see . Ron Weasley , sir . But I 'm dead awful at Potions . A menace , actually so . I 'm probably just gon na -- Nonsense , we 'll sort you out . Any friend of Harry 's is a friend of mine . Get your books out . I 'm sorry , sir , I have n't actually got my book yet and nor is Ron . Not to worry , get what you want from the cupboard . Now as I was
zone2	ideas what these might be ? - Yes , Miss ... ? - Granger , sir . That one there is Veritaserum . It 's a truth-telling serum . And that one -- It 's terribly tricky to make . This is Amortentia . The most powerful love potion in the world . It 's rumored to smell differently to each person according to what attracts them . For example , I smell ... Freshly mown grass and new parchment and ... Spearmint toothpaste . Now Amortentia does n't create actual love . That would be impossible , but it does cause powerful infatuation or obsession . And for that reason , it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room . Sir , you have n't told us what 's in that one . Oh yes . What you see before you , ladies and gentlemen , is a curious little potion , known as Felix Felicis . But it is more commonly known referred to as -- - Liquid luck . - Yes , Miss Granger . Liquid luck . Desperately tricky to make , disastrous should
zone2	find that all of your endeavours succeed . At least until the effects wear off . So this is what I offer each of you today . One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student who in the hour that remains , manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Dead . Recipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books . Issue one doubt , however . Only one set of student manage to brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize . Nevertheless , good luck to you all . Let the brewing commence . How did you do that ? You crush it , do n't cut it . No , the instructions specifically says to cut . No , really . Merlin 's beard ! It is perfect ! So perfect I 'd just say one drop would kill us all ! Here we are then , as promised . One vial of Felix Felicis . Congratulations . Use it well . Oh Harry , you got my message ? Come in . How are you ? I 'm fine
zone2	Slughorn is most impressed with you . I think he overestimates my abilities , sir . Do you ? Definitely . What about your activities outside the classroom ? Sir ? Well , I notice you 've spent a great deal of time with Miss Granger . I ca n't help wondering if -- Oh , no , no , I mean ... She 's brilliant and we 're friends . - But no . - Forgive me . I was only being curious . But enough chit-chat . You must be wondering why I summoned you here tonight . The answer lies here . What you 're looking at are memories . In this case , pertaining to one individual : Voldemort . Or as he was known , then : Tom Riddle . This vial contains the most sufficient memory . On the day I first met him . I 'd like you to see it . If you want . I 'm to admit to some confusion for receiving your letter , Mr . Dumbledore . In all the years Tom 's been here , he 's
zone2	incidents with the other children -- Nasty things . Tom , you have a visitor . How 'd you do , Tom ? Do n't . You 're the doctor , are n't you ? No , I 'm a professor . I do n't believe you . She wants me looked at . They think I 'm ... different . Or perhaps they 're right . I 'm not mad . Hogwarts is not a place for mad people . Hogwarts is a school . School of magic . You can do things , ca n't you , Tom ? Things other children ca n't . I can make things move without touching them . I can make animals do what I want without training them . I can make bad things happen to people who mean to me . Can make them hurt . If I want . Who are you ? Well , I 'm like you , Tom . I 'm different . Prove it . I think there 's something in your wardrobe trying to get out , Tom . Thievery is not tolerated at
zone2	taught not only how to use magic , but how to control it . You understand me ? I can speak to snakes too . They find me . Whisper things . Is that normal for someone like me ? Did you know , sir , then ? Did I know I just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time ? No . If I had , I ... Over time while here at Hogwarts , Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher . Can you guess who that teacher might be ? You did n't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach potions , did you , sir ? No , I did not . You see , Professor Slughorn possesses something that I desire very dearly . He will not give it out easily . You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect to me . I did . Do you want me to let him ? Yes . Okay , so this morning , I 'm gon na be putting you all for a few drills just to assess you straight . Quiet ,
zone2	, now then , remember , just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year . Is that clear ? Good . No hard feelings , Weasley , alright ? Hard feelings ? Yeah , I 'll be going out for Keeper 's , well , It 's ... nothing personal . Really ? Such a big guy like you ? You 've got more of a Beater 's build , do n't you think ? Keepers need to be quick , agile . I 'll have my chances . Say , um , you think you could introduce me to your friend , Granger ? Would n't mind , eh , getting on a first-hand base , you know what I mean ? Come on , come on . Go , Cormac . Come on , Ron ! Come on , Ron . Confundus . He 's brilliant . I have to admit I thought I was going to miss that last one . I hope Cormac 's not taking it too hard . He 's got a bit of a thing
zone2	Have you ever heard of the spell : Sectumsempra ? No , I have n't . If you had a shred of self-respect , you 'd hand that book in . Not bloody likely . He 's top of the class . He 's even better than you , Hermione . Slughorn thinks he 's a genius . I 'd like to know who 's that book was . - Let 's have a look , shall we ? - No . Why not ? The binding is fragile . " The binding is fragile " ? Yeah . - Who 's the Half-Blood Prince ? - Who ? That 's what it says right here . This book is property of the Half-Blood Prince . For weeks , you carry around this book . Practically , sleep with it , and yet you have no desire to find out who the Half-Blood Prince is . I did n't say I was n't curious and I do n't sleep with it . Well , it 's true . Well , I got a nice chat before I go to bed
zone2	It 's like being with Hermione . Well , I was curious So , I went to -- - The library ? - The library ? And ? And nothing . I could n't find a reference anywhere to the Half-Blood Prince . There we go . That settles it , then . Yeah , uh ... hoping to find you in the Three Broomsticks . Uh no , emergency choir practice from the freighthorse . Does anyone fancy a butterbeer ? A chum of mine was sledging down Clagsby Hill . We had a very long , home-made Norwegian style sledge . We hurtled down , we hit what most ... Ron , sit aside me . Okay . Something to drink ? Three butterbeers and some ginger in mine , please . Oh , bloody hell . Ron , see they 're only holding hands . And snogging . - I 'd like to leave . - What ? You ca n't be serious . - That happens to be my sister . - So ? What if she looked at me and saw you snogging me ?
zone2	- Hey , my boy . - So wonderful to see you . And you , and you . So what brings you here ? Oh , Three Broomsticks and I go way back further than I care to admit . I could remember when it was One Broomstick . All hands on deck , Granger . Listen , my boy , in the old days , I used to throw together the occassional supper party . Select a student or two . Would you be game ? I consider it an honor , sir . You 'd be welcome too , Granger . - I 'd be delighted , sir . - Splendid ! Look for my owl . Good to see you , Wallenby . What are you playing at ? Dumbledore 's asked me to get to know him . - Get to know him ? - Du n no . It must be important . If it was n't , Dumbledore would n't ask . You got a little bit ... Katie , we do n't know what it could be . - Harry , what
zone2	you hear what she was saying back in the pub there on me and her snogging ? I warned her . I warned her not to touch it . Do n't get any closer ! Get back , all of you . Oh no , no , no . Do not touch that , except for the wrappings . Do you understand ? You 're sure Katie did not have this in her possession when she entered the Three Broomsticks ? It 's like I said . She left to go to the loo . And when she came back , she had the package . She said it was important that she deliver it . - Did she say to whom ? - To Professor Dumbledore . Very well . Thank you , Leanne . You may go . Why is it when something happens , it is always you three ? Believe me , Professor , I 've been asking myself the same question for six years . Oh , Severus . What do you think ? I think Ms . Bell is lucky to be alive .
zone2	Katie . Off the Quidditch pitch , she would n't hurt a fly . If she was delivering that to Professor Dumbledore , she was n't doing it knowingly . Yes , she was cursed . It was Malfoy . That is a very serious accusation , Potter . Indeed . Your evidence ? I just know . You " just " know . Once again , you 're astonished with your gifts , Potter . Gifts mere mortals can only dream of possessing . How grand it must be to be the Chosen One . I suggest you go back to your dormitories . All of you . What do you suppose Dean sees in her-- Ginny ? And what does she see in him ? Dean - - He 's brilliant . You called him slick git not five hours ago . Yeah , well , he was running his hands all over my sister , was n't he ? Something snaps . You 've got to hate him , you know ? Old principle . I suppose . So what do you think he sees in her
zone2	funny , attractive -- Attractive ? You know , she 's got nice skin . Skin ? You 're saying Dean 's dating my sister because of her skin ? For blood , I mean . I 'm just - - I 'm just saying it could be a contributing factor . Hermione 's got nice skin . When you say it , as skin goes , I mean . I 've never really thought about it . But I suppose , yeah . Very nice . I think I 'll be going to sleep now . Right . So tell me , Cormac , do you see anything of your uncle Tiberius these days ? Yes , sir , in fact I 'm meant to get hunting with him and the Minister of Magic over the holidays . Oh , well , be sure to give them both my best . And what about your uncle , Belby ? For those of you who do n't know well , Marcus ' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion . Is he working on anything new ? I do n't know .
zone2	Prolly cause my dad says potions are rubbish . His only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the day . And what about you , Ms . Granger , what exactly does your family do in the Muggle world ? My parents are dentists . They attend to people 's teeth . Fascinating . And is that considered a dangerous profession ? No . Although , one boy , Robby Fenwich , did bite my father once . He needed ten stitches . Ah , Ms . Weasley . Come in , come in . Look , her eyes . They 've been fighting again . Her and Dean . Sorry , I 'm not usually late . No matter , just in time for dessert . That is if Belby has left you any . - What ? - Nothing . Goodbye . Bye-bye . Potter ! I 'm sorry , sir , I was just admiring your hourglass . Ah yes , most intriguing object . The sand runs in accordance with the quality of the conversation . It is stimulating , the
zone2	- I think I 'll be going , then . Nonsense . You have nothing to fear , dear boy . Actually , some of your classmates ... Well , let 's just say they 're unlikely to make the shelf . Shelf , sir ? Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here . But then again , you already are someone , are n't you , Harry ? Did Voldemort ever make the shelf , sir ? You knew him , did n't you , sir ? Tom Riddle ? You were his teacher . Mr . Riddle had a number of teachers who was here at Hogwarts . What was he like ? I 'm sorry , sir . Forgive me . He killed my parents . Of course , it 's only natural you should want to know more . But I 'm afraid I must disappoint you , Harry . When I first met young Mr . Riddle , he was a quiet , albeit brilliant boy , committed to becoming a first-grade wizard . Not unlike others I 've known .
zone2	existed , it was very deep within . You okay , Ron ? I 'm counting on you , Ron . I 've 2 games on Gryffindor , ya ? - Be good , Ron . - Loser ! What 's he wearing ? - So how was it , then ? - How is what ? - Your dinner party ? - Pretty boring actually . But I think Harry enjoyed dessert . Slughorn 's having Christmas , do you know ? I 'm about to bring someone . I expect you 'll be bringing McLaggen . He 's in the Slug Club , is n't he ? Actually , I was going to ask you . Really ? Good luck today , Ron . I know you 'll be brilliant . I 'm resigning . After today 's match , McLaggen can have my spot . Are you alright ? - Juice ? - Sure . Hello , everyone . You look dreadful , Ron . Is that why you put something in his cup ? Is it a tonic ? Liquid luck . Do n't drink it
zone2	. - What are we talking about ? Come on , Harry , we 've got a game to win . - Weasley ! Weasley ! Weasley ! - Weasley ! Weasley ! Weasley ! You should n't have done it . I know . I supposed I could have just used the Confundus charm . That was different . That was try-outs , this was a natural game . You did n't put in ? Ron only thought you did . Charm spell . Just practising . Very good . How does it feel , Harry ? When you see Dean with Ginny ? I know . I see the way you look at her . You 're my best friend . Oops ! I think this room 's taken . What 's with the birds ? Oppugno . It feels like this . I ca n't help it if she 's got her knickers in a twist . What Lav and I have , well , let 's just say , there 's no stopping it . It 's chemical . Will it last ? Who knows ?
zone2	at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes . I really could n't care less . Was I under the impression he and I would be attending Slughorn 's Christmas party together ? Yes . Now , given the circumstances , I had to make other arrangements . - Have you ? - Yes . Why ? Well , I just thought seeing is not the risk at going with who we 'd really like to , We should go together , as friends . Why did n't I think of that ? Who are you going with ? Um , it 's a surprise . Anyways , you have got to worry about . You ca n't take anyone . You see that girl over there ? That 's Romilda Vane . Harry , she 's been been trying to smuggle you a love potion . Really ? Hey ! She 's only interested in you because she thinks you 're the Chosen One . But I am the Chosen One . Okay , sorry , um ... Kidding . I 'll ask someone I like . Someone cool
zone2	castle . At least , not while awake . I sleep-walk , you see . That 's why I wear shoes to bed . Harmonia nictere passus . Harmonia nictere passus . Harmonia nictere passus . Drink ? Neville . I did n't get into the Slug Club . It 's okay , though . He 's got Melvin hanging up towels in the looroom . I 'm - - I 'm fine , mate . Thanks . Okay . Hermione , what are you doing ? What happened to you ? No , I 've just escaped . I mean , I left Cormac under the mistletoe . Cormac ? That 's who you invited ? I thought it would annoy Ron the most . Thank you very much . We will catch up with you . He 's got more tentacles than a Snargaluff plant . - Dragon tails ? - No , I 'm fine , thank you . Just this one . They give one horribly bad breath . On second thoughts , it might keep Cormac away . God , here he comes . I
zone2	's a little minx , your friend . Nice to work . How nasty is n't she ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . What is this I 'm eating , by the way ? Dragon balls . You 've just brought yourself a month 's detention , McLaggen . Not so quick , Potter . Sir , I really think I should rejoin the party . My date -- Can surely survive your absence for another minute or two . Besides , I only wish to convey a message . - Message ? - From Professor Dumbledore . He asked me to give you his best and he hopes you enjoy your holidays . He ... He 's travelling . And he wo n't return until term resumes . Travelling where ? How are you ? Get your hands off me , you filthy Squibb . Professor Slughorn , sir . I just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor . He claims to have been invited to your party . Okay , okay , I was gate-crashing . Happy ? I 'll escort him out . Certainly
zone2	on . Maybe I did hex that Bell girl . Maybe I did n't . What about you ? I swore to protect you . I made the Unbreakable Vow . I do n't need protection . I was chosen for this . I do n't know what all this mean , - but I wo n't fail him . - You 're afraid , Draco . You attempt to consider , but it 's obvious , - let me assist you . - No . I was chosen . This is my moment . Unbreakable Vow . You sure that 's what Snape said ? Positive . Why ? It 's just , you ca n't break an Unbreakable Vow . I-I worked that much out for myself , funny enough . I do n't understand . Oh bloody hell . I miss you . Lovely . All she wants to do is snog me . My lips are getting chapped , look . Then I 'll take your word for it . So what happens to you ? What happens if you break an Unbreakable Vow ? You
zone2	? - I know it sounds mad . - Has it occured to you , Harry , that Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help so he could find out what he was up to ? Ginny ! That 's not what it sounded like . Perhaps Harry is right , Remus . I mean , to make an Unbreakable Vow -- It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore 's judgement . Dumbledore trusts Snape , therefore , I do . Dumbledore can make mistakes . - He said so himself . - You are blinded by hatred . - I 'm not . - Yes , you are . People are disappearing , Harry . Daily . We could only place our trust in a handful of people . If we started fighting amongst ourselves , we 're doomed . Ginny ! Open up , you . Do n't you trust me ? It 's good . Just , uh , get ... - Pie ? - Not for me . No . You 'll have to forgive Remus . It takes its toll ,
zone2	? We 're being followed , all of us . Most days , Molly does n't leave the house . It 's not been easy . Did you get my owl ? Yes , I did . If Dumbledore is traveling , then perhaps news to the Ministry , but perhaps that 's the way Dumbledore wants it . As for Draco Malfoy ... I know a bit more . - Go on . - I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes . I think from what you described ... What you and Ron saw at the end of summer , the object that Draco is so interested in , is a Vanishing Cabinet . A " Vanishing Cabinet " ? They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power . You can see the appeal . Should the Death Eaters come knocking , one simply have to slip inside and disappear for an hour or two . It transports you practically anywhere . Tricky contraptions , though . Very temperamental . What happened to it ? The one at Borgin and Burkes ? Nothing . It
zone2	really . Are you sure you wo n't stay ? No , we should go . The first night of the cycle 's always the worst . Remus ? Sweetheart . Has Ron gone to bed ? Um , not yet . No . Shoelace ... Merry Christmas , Harry . Merry Christmas . - Harry , no ! - Harry ! Remus . Ginny ! I killed Sirius Black ! I killed Sirius Black ! You coming to get me ? Get me ! He 's trying to get me ! Harry ? Stupefy ! Harry ! Ginny ! Molly . It 's so easy for them to get to you . You 're bloody lucky you were n't killed . You have to realise who you are , Harry ! I know who I am , Hermione , alright . Sorry . Hon , go somewhere . That 's my Won-Won . Excuse me , I have to go and vomit . ... Always you ruin half the start . Sir , is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring ? Tom , I could n't tell you
zone2	way , thank you for the pineapple . You 're quite right . It is my favorite . But how did you know ? Intuition . Good gracious , is it that time already ? Off you go , boys , or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention . Look sharp , Tom . Do n't be caught out of bed after hours . Is something on your mind , Tom ? Yes , sir . See , I could n't think of anyone else to go to . The other professors ... Well , they 're not like you . They might misunderstand . Go on . I was in the library the other night . In the restricted section . And I picked something rather odd about this rare magic . I thought perhaps , you could illuminate me . It 's called , as I understand it , Hor ... I beg your pardon ? I do n't know anything about such things and if I did , I would n't tell you . Now get out of here at once and do n't let
zone2	I 'd be surprised if you were n't . I do n't understand . What happened ? This is perhaps the most important memory I had collected . It is also a lie . This memory has been tempered with by the same person whose memory it is . Our old friend , Professor Slughorn . But why would he temper with his own memory ? I suspect he 's ashamed of it . Why ? Why , indeed . I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you had done so . Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory . Any way you can . I do n't know him that well , sir . This memory is everything . Without it , we are blind . Without it , we leave the fate of our world to chance . You have no choice . You must not fail . I highly recommend , reacquaint yourself with the chapter on antidotes . Now , I 'll tell you more about bezoars in our next class . Right , off you go .
zone2	! It is n't the Prince of Potions himself ! What do I owe this pleasure ? Oh , sir , I wondered if I wanted to ask you something . Ask away , dear boy . Ask away . Well , you see the other day , I was in the library in the restricted section , and I came across something rather odd about a very rare piece of magic . Yes , what was this rare piece of magic ? Well , I do n't know , but I ca n't remember the name exactly . But it just got me wondering , are there some kinds of magic you 're not allowed to teach us ? I 'm Potions Master , Harry , I think your question better be posed to Professor Snape . Yes , he and I do n't exactly see eye-to-eye , sir . What I mean to say is ... Well , he 's not like you . He might misunderstand . Yes , it would be no light without the dark . And so it is with magic , myself I
zone2	you do the same . Is that what you told Tom Riddle , sir , when he came asking questions ? Dumbledore put you up to this , did n't he ? Did n't he ? Yes ? Oh , it 's you , Potter . I-I 'm sorry , I 'm busy at the moment . That 's beautiful , is n't it ? The moon . Divine . Had ourselves a little late night snack , did we ? It was on your bed , the box . I just thought I 'd try one . Or twenty ? I ca n't stop thinking about her , Harry . Honestly , you know , I reckon she was starting to annoy you . She could never annoy me . I think I love her . Well , brilliant . Do you think she knows I exist ? I very well hope so . She 's been snogging you for three months . Snogging ? Who are you talking about ? Who are you talking about ? Romilda , of course . Romilda Vane . Okay , very funny
zone2	. - I 'm in love with her ! - Alright , fine . You 're in love with her . Have you ever actually met her ? No . Can you introduce me ? Come on , Ron . I will introduce you to Romilda Vane . I 'm sorry , sir . I would n't bother you if it were n't absolutely essential . - Where 's Romilda ? - What 's the matter with Wimby ? Very powerful love potion . Very well , better bring him in . I always thought you could whip up a remedy for this is in no time , Harry . Well , I-I thought this called for more practised hands , sir . Hello , darling . Fancy a drink ? Perhaps , you 're right . I 'm sorry , by the way , Professor , about earlier today . Our misunderstanding . Oh , not at all . Old water under the bridge , you know . Correct ? Well , I expect you 're tired a bit , after all these years . And the questions about
zone2	go , boy . Bottom 's up . - What 's this ? - Tonic for the nerves . What happened to me ? - A love potion . - A bloody strong one at there . - I feel really bad . - You need to pick me up , my boy . Got butterbeer , wine , dazzling oak-matured mead . I had other intentions for this , but I think , given the circumstances . Here you are , Potter . To life ! Ron ! Ron ! Professor , do something . I-I do n't understand ! Come on , Ron , breathe ! These girls ... They 're gon na kill me . Quick thinking on your part , Harry , using a bezoar . You should be very proud of your student , Horace . Ah , yes . Very proud . I think we agree Potter 's actions were heroic . The question is : Why were they necessary ? I , indeed . This appears to be a gift , Horace . You do n't remember who gave you this bottle ?
zone2	liquorice and cherry . When not polluted with poison . Actually , I had intended to give it as a gift , myself . To whom , might I ask ? To you , headmaster . Where is he ? Where 's my Won-Won ? Has he been asking for me ? What 's she doing here ? I might ask you the same question . I happen to be his girlfriend . And I happen to be his ... friend . Do n't make me laugh . You have n't spoken in weeks . I suppose you want to make up with him now that he 's suddenly all interesting . He 's been poisoned , you daft dimbo ! And for the record , I 've always found him interesting . See ? He senses my presence . Do n't worry , Won-Won . I 'm here . I 'm here . Hermione . Hermione . Hermione . Oh to be young and to feel love 's keen sting . Well , come over , everybody . Mr . Weasley 's well attended . About time , do
zone2	. Stop it , Ron . You 're making it snow . Tell me how I broke up with Lavender again . Well , she came to visit you in the hospital . And you talked . I do n't believe it was a particularly long conversation . Do n't get me wrong . I 'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her 's . She seems a bit ... put out . Yes , um ... She does , is n't she ? You say you do n't remember anything from that night . Anything at all ? There is something . It ca n't be . I was completely boggled , did n't I ? Boggled . Harry ... That 's Katie . Katie Bell . Katie , how are you ? I know you 're going to ask , Harry . But I do n't know who cursed me . I 've been trying to remember . Honestly . But I just ca n't . Katie . I know what you did , Malfoy . You hexed it , did n't you ? Sectumsempra ! You have
zone2	hand . It 's the Room of Requirement . We need to hide the Half-Blood Prince 's book . Where no one 'll ever find it . Including you . - What was that ? - What was that ? See , you never know what you 'll find up here . Alright , close your eyes . That way you ca n't be tempted . Close your eyes . S u B : V e R d i K T That can stay hidden up here too if you like . So , did you and Ginny do it then ? What ? Well , hide the book ? Oh , yeah . Oh , g -- Still no luck with Slughorn then , I take it ? Luck . That 's it . All I need is a bit of luck . Well , how do you feel ? Excellent . Really excellent . Remember , Slughorn usually leaves early , takes a walk , and then returns to his office . Right . I 'm going down to Hagrid 's . What ? No , Harry ,
zone2	We have a plan . I know but I 've got a really good feeling about Hagrid 's . I feel it 's - - it 's the place to be tonight . Do you know what I mean ? - No . - No . Well , trust me . I know what I 'm doing . Or Felix does . Hi ! - Merlin 's beard , Harry ! - Sorry , sir . I should have announced myself . Clear my throat . Coughed . You probably thought I was Professor Sprout ? Definitely . What makes you think ? Ah well , just your general behaviour , sir . Just sneaking around , jumping when you saw me . - Are those tentacular leaves , sir ? - Yes . They 're very valuable , are n't they ? Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer . Not that I 'm familiar with any such back alley transactions but one does hear rumours . My only interests are purely academical . I mean , personally , these plants always kinda freak me out . Exactly
zone2	? Through the front door , sir . I 'm off to Hagrid 's , you see . He 's a very dear friend and I just fancy paying him a visit . So if you do n't mind , I will be going now . - Harry ! - Sir ? It 's nearly nightfall . Surely , you realise I ca n't allow you to go roaming the grounds by yourself . Well then , by all means , come along , sir . Harry , I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately ! That would be counterproductive , sir . And what makes you say that ? No idea . Horace . Merlin 's beard ! Is that an actual Acromantula ? A dead one , I think , sir . Good God . Dear fellow , however did you manage to kill it ? " Kill it " ? My oldest friend , he was . I 'm so sorry , I did n't -- Ah , do n't worry yourself . You 're not alone . Seriously misunderstood creatures , spiders
zone2	folk . Not to mention the pincers . Yeah , I reckon that too . Hagrid ... The last thing I wish to be is indelicate but Acromantula venom is uncommonly rare . Would you allow me to extract a vial or two , purely for academic purposes , you understand ? Well I do n't suppose it 's gon na do him much good now is it . My thoughts exactly . I have a ampoule or two about my person for just such occassions as this . Old ... Potion master 's habit , you know ? I wish you could have seen him with his prime . Magnificent , he was . Just magnificent . Would you like me to say a few words ? Yes . Had a family , I trust ? Oh , yeah . - Farewell ... - Aragog . Farewell , Aragog . King of the arachnids . Your body will decay ... but your spirit lingers on and your human friends find solace , the loss they have sustained . # Laid to rest , # # And his wand ,
zone2	# I had him from an egg , you know ? Tiny little thing he was when he hatched . No bigger than a Pekingese . A Pekingese , mind you . How sweet ! I once had a fish . Francis . He was very dear to me . One afternoon , I came downstairs and ... it vanished . Poof . That 's very odd , is n't it ? Yes , does n't it ? But that 's life ! I suppose , you - - you go along with and suddenly ... poof . Poof . Poof . It was a student who gave me Francis . One spring afternoon , I discovered the bowl on my desk ... With just a few inches of clear water in it ... And floating on the surface was a flower petal . As I watched , it sank . But just before it reached the bottom , it transformed into a wee fish . It was beautiful magic . Wondrous to behold . The flower petal had come from a lily . Your mother . The day I
zone2	That 's the day your mother ... I know why you 're here . But I ca n't help you . It would ruin me . Do you know why I survived , Professor ? The night I got this ? Because of her , because she sacrificed herself ... Because she refused to step aside . Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort . - Do n't say his name . - I 'm not afraid of the name , Professor . I 'm going to tell you something . Something others have only guessed at . It 's true . I am the Chosen One . Only I can destroy him , but in order to do so , I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you all those years ago in your office and I need to know what you told him . Be brave , Professor . Be brave like my mother . Otherwise , you disgrace her . Otherwise , she died for nothing . Otherwise , the bowl will remain empty . Forever . Please , do n't think badly of me
zone2	he was like , even then . I was in the library the other day . In the restricted section ... and I read something rather odd about this rare magic . It 's called , as I understand it , a Horcrux . - I beg your pardon ? - Horcrux . I came across the term while reading ... and I did n't fully understand it . I 'm not sure what you were reading , Tom , but this is very dark stuff . Very dark , indeed . Which is ... why I came to you . A horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul . But I do n't understand how that works , sir . One splits one 's soul and hides part of it in an object . By doing so , you are protected , should you be attacked and your body destroyed . Protected ? That part of your soul which is hidden lives on . In other words , you can not die . And how does one splits his soul , sir
zone2	, Tom . Murder . Yes , killing rips the soul apart and it is a violation against nature . Can you only split the soul once ? For instance , is n't seven -- Seven ? Merlin 's beard , Tom ! Is n't it bad enough to consider killing one person ? To rip the soul in seven pieces ! This is all hypothetical , is n't it , Tom ? All academic ? Of course , sir . It 'll be our little secret . Sir . This is beyond anything I imagined . Do you mean , sir , he succeeded , sir ? - In making a Horcrux ? - Oh yes , he succeeded , alright . - And not just once . - What are they exactly ? It could be anything . Most common place of objects . A ring , for example , or a book . Tom Riddle 's diary . It 's a horcrux , yes . Four years ago when you saved Ginny Weasley 's life in the Chamber of Secrets , you brought me this . I
zone2	. Very dark , very powerful . But until tonight , I had no idea just how powerful ... - And the ring ? - Belonged to Voldemort 's mother . Difficult to find . Even more difficult to destroy . But if you could find them all , if you did destroy each Horcrux -- One destroys Voldemort . How would you find them ? They could be hidden anywhere , could n't they ? True , but magic , especially dark magic ... leaves traces . It 's where you 've been going , is n't it , sir ? When you leave the school . Yes , and I think perhaps , I may have found another . But this time , I can not hope to destroy it alone . Once again , I must ask too much of you , Harry . Have you ever considered that you ask too much , that you take too much for granted ? Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I do n't want to do this anymore ? Whether it has or has n't is irrelevant
zone2	You agreed . Nothing more to discuss . Oh , Harry ... You need a shave , my friend . You know , at times , I forget how much you 've grown . At times , I still see the small boy from the cupboard . Forgive my mawkishness , Harry . I 'm an old man . You still look the same to me , sir . Just like your mother , you are unfailingly kind . A trait people never fail to undervalue , I 'm afraid . The place to which we journey tonight is extremely dangerous . I promise you for the company of me and I stand by that promise . But there 's one condition . You must obey every command I give you without question . Yes , sir . You do understand what I 'm saying . Should I tell you to hide , you hide . Should I tell you to run , you run . Should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself , you must do so . Your word , Harry . My word .
zone2	n't Apparate within Hogwarts . Well , being me has its privileges . This is the place . Oh , yes . This place has known magic . Sir . In order to gain passage , payment must be made . Payment intended to weaken any intruder . You should have let me , sir . No , no , Harry . Your blood 's much more precious than mine . Voldemort would not have made it easy to discover his hiding place . He would put certain defenses in position . Careful . There it is . The only question is how do we get there ? If you would , Harry . Do you think the Horcrux is in there , sir ? Oh , yes . It has to be drunk . All of it has to be drunk . You remember the conditions on which I brought you with me ? This potion might paralyze me . I may risk to get what I 'm here . I 'd cause me so much pain that I 'd beg for relief . You are not to indulge
zone2	to make sure I keep drinking this potion . Even if you have to force it down my throat . Understood ? Why ca n't I drink it , sir ? Because I 'm much older , much cleverer and much less valuable . Your good health , Harry . Professor . Professor ! Professor . Can you hear me ? Professor ! You have to keep drinking like you said , remember ? - Stop . - I will stop . I will stop . But only - - only if you keep drinking . - Do n't make me-- Kill me . - I 'm sorry , sir . Kill me ! All my fault . My fault . Just one more , sir . One more , I promise . - I promise I 'll do what you say . - No , no . I promise ! Please ! Harry . Water . - Water . - Water . Look , you did it , sir . Look . Harry ... water . Aguamenti ! Water . Lumos . Lumos maxima ! Stupefy ! Stupefy !
zone2	! - Harry ... Harry ... Partis Temporus ! Go to your houses ! No toddling ! We need to get you to the hospital wing , sir . To Madam Pomfrey . No ... Severus , Severus is awakening . Wake him . Tell him what happened . Speak to no one else . Severus , Harry . Hide yourself below , Harry . Do n't speak or be seen by anybody without my permission . Whatever happens , it 's imperative you stay below . Harry , do as I say . Trust me . Trust me . Good evening , Draco . What brings you here on this fine spring evening ? Who else is here ? I heard you talking . I often talk aloud to myself . I find it extraordinarily useful . Have you always been to yourself , Draco ? Draco , you are no assassin . How do you know what I am ? I 've done things that would shock you . Oh , like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in return she would bear a cursed necklace to me
zone2	with poison . Forgive me , Draco , I can not help feel these actions are so weak that your ... heart ca n't really have been in . He trusts me . I was chosen . I shall make it easy for you . Expelliarmus ! Very good . Very good . You 're not alone . There are others . How ? The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement . I 've been mending it . Let me guess , it has a sister . A twin . In Borgin and Burkes . - They form a passage . - Ingenious . Draco , years ago , I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices . Please let me help you . I do n't want your help . Do n't you understand ? I have to do this . I have to kill you . Or he 's gon na kill me . Oh , look what we have here . Well done , Draco . Good evening , Bellatrix . I think introductions are n't over , do n't you ? Love to
zone2	a bit of tight schedule . Do it ! He does n't have the stomach . Just like his father . Let me finish him in my own way . No , the Dark Lord was clear the boy has to do it . This is your moment , Draco . Do it ! Go on , Draco , now ! No . Severus . Please ... Avada Kedavra . Hagrid ! Snape , he trusted you ! Go on ! Incarcerous ! Fight back , you coward ! Fight back ! No , he belongs to the Dark Lord . Sectumsempra ! You dare use my own spells against me , Potter ? Yes , I 'm the Half-Blood Prince . Potter ... Enlighten what has happened . If you should have the need to talk to someone ... You should know ... Professor Dumbledore ... You meant a great deal to him . Do you think he would have done it ? Draco . No . No , he was lowering his wand . In the end , it was Snape . It was always Snape . I
zone2	To the Dark Lord : I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret . I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can . I face death in the hope that when you meet your match , you will be mortal once more . R.A.B . - R.A.B . ? - Do n't know . But whoever they are , they have the real Horcrux . It means it was all a waste . All of it . Ron 's okay with you , you know . You and Ginny . If I were you when he 's around , I 'd keep snogging to a minimum . I 'm not coming back , Hermione . I got to finish whatever Dumbledore started . And I do n't know where that 'll leave me , but I 'll let you and Ron know where I am ... when I can . I 've always admired your courage , Harry . But sometimes , you can be
zone2	going to be able to find all those Horcruxes by yourself , do you ? You need us , Harry . I never realised how beautiful this place was .
zone2	6672813 Let 's hear a few words from our fair hostess . Come on , Shannon . Give us a speech . Speech ! Yes , of course . On behalf of the Blake clan , myself included ... I want to welcome all of our mighty competitors ... to the first ever Loch Ness Highland Games . And I want to thank all of the volunteers who helped us transform ... the ancient grounds of Blake Castle into a first-rate tournament field . Now the Blakes can finally be known for something ... besides getting themselves into trouble , Shannon ? I just hope we can survive the embarrassment ... should you be our winning contestant , Angus Haggart . That 's me , brother you be speaking to , Lassie . And if anyone 's got claim to be embarrassed by him , it 's me . Aye , then . What do you say we start the games early ? - Biggest splash wins . - You 're on . Wait ! No ! Please , guys , get back in the boat . What ? Afraid the Legend of the Loch might be coming back for
zone2	I did n't know any better , Shannon Blake ... I 'd be thinking you believed in the Loch Ness Monster . What the ... . No , it can not be . Colin ! Angus ! Get out of the water now ! Hold on ! We 're double-anchored . She wo n't move an inch till we hoist them up . Brace yourselves ! - I do n't believe it . - What was that ? I do n't know what to think . - Are you all right , Shannon ? - Silence ! For a thousand years it has swam in the shadows below . You have disturbed the spirit that haunts these waters . Too afraid to sleep at night ? Trembling in your beds with fright ? ' T is not the darkness drawing near ... but the Loch Ness Monster you should fear . How beautiful . This Scottish countryside is so lush and green . Yeah . Just like a giant golf course . Jinkies , Daphne . It must be exciting to visit Blake Castle ... the ancient home of your
zone2	n't wait to help my cousin Shannon ... host the Loch Ness Highland Games . I even accessorized for the occasion . Look . I 'm planning to wear this for the opening ceremonies ... in honor of the Blakes of Loch Ness . Like , it 's not the Blakes of Loch Ness that I 'm worried about . Are you , by chance , referring to the legend of the Loch Ness Monster ? Monster ? Yeah . And , like , why are we going to some place ... that 's already got a monster named after it ? Makes no sense . Legend of the Loch . Get real . It 's just another big fake , right , Velma ? I 'm not so sure about that . Jeepers ! You believe in the Loch Ness Monster , Velma ? - Like , that makes three of us . - Yeah . One , two , three . I believe it 's a mystery . This monster is different . There have been over 2000 Loch Ness Monster sightings ... dating all the way back
zone2	ago . - Zoinks ! Like , a monster ... that 's been scaring people for more than a thousand years . Do n't worry , Shaggy , Loch Ness has miles of shoreline ... and I bet Shannon knows a lot of good places to have a beach party . Beach party ? Hear that , Scoob ? We can have a clambake with the clan Blake . Yeah , clambake . That 's it , gang . Loch Ness , dead ahead . Like , did you have to say dead ? This fog is as thick as pea soup . Boy , pea soup . Come back , Scoob . It 's just a figure of speech . What 's the matter , old buddy ? Monster ! Monster ? Like , do n't tell me . I do n't want to know . - Man ! What is that ? - What in the world ? Can we get closer ? Freddie ! The road ! When I said get closer , this is n't exactly what I meant . Did we just see what I
zone2	gone now . Come on , gang . This loch water could shrink my genuine vinyl upholstery . Jeepers . Guys , look , I think we 're here . There 's Blake Castle . I just got this baby hot waxed . Look at all those tents . I wonder if there 's a circus in town . That 's the sports field for the Highland Games ... a competition featuring traditional Scottish sporting events . Like , who 's ever heard of the telephone pole pitch ? That 's the caber toss , Shaggy . It 's a test of strength and skill . When they invent a game that tests eating and sleeping , let us know . The tent colors work for me , but that crashed sailboat totally clashes . Jinkies ! I wonder what happened . Come on , gang , let 's go check it out . - Shannon ! - Daphne ! I ca n't believe I 'm really here . Guys , this is my cousin Shannon . We should have known by her great sense of color coordination . Of
zone2	happened to your boat , Shannon ? That ? You see ... . Cool ride . No , what are you doing ? This whole area has to be roped off for evidence . - Not now , Del . - A friend of yours ? Hardly . We 've got 20 eyewitnesses . A large wake . Something big , something really , really big . Why ca n't it ever be something small ? Something really , really small ? This is major . Do n't you see ? It 's because of the games . All the activity has disturbed the creature . Zoinks ! The only disturbed creature around here is you , Del Chillman . Why , me own sons were out there , and they 're not spooked a bit . - Angus was scared . - I was not , Colin . I 'll put your neck like that . I -- That 's enough . Save it for the games , laddies . Now come on , go on down to the track . Off you go . But , Mr .
zone2	sir . You ca n't just ignore this . We could try . You 'll see , man . I told you those games were a mistake , Shannon . Now the monster 's after you ! By the way , big party at Stubby 's tonight . Supposed to have a band . Wow , Blake Castle ! I 've waited my whole life to see this . There 's over 800 years of Blake family history ... within these walls . Ours is a rich history of falling through trap doors ... finding dangerous secret passageways , and getting caught ... in overly complicated booby traps of our own design . The one thing we Blakes have been known for is being ... . How should I put this ? Danger-prone . What ? Stunning architecture . Love the gargoyle . Despite all these years of misfortune ... no one at Blake Castle has ever had any trouble with the monster . Like , that 's what I like to hear . That is , until now . Like , zoinks . It actually began just a few
zone2	the boat dock . All of a sudden , something very big and very fast came cruising into the cove . It disappeared below the surface , and I lost sight of it . When I fell asleep that night ... I awoke to the strangest sound I 'd ever heard in all me life . And then it was gone . Just like that . Come on , you two , out of the armor . Like , ever heard of Scotland the Brave ? Meet Shaggy the chicken . Jeepers ! So , the monster is n't locked in the Loch ? Many people claim to have seen the Loch Ness Monster on land . When I woke up the next morning ... I tried to tell myself that it was only a dream , but -- It was not a dream . And last night 's shipwreck was no accident . It was the great beast of the Loch . Zoinks ! Who 's the creepy lady in the beret ? I do n't know . - Everyone , I 'd like you to meet -- -
zone2	Ness expert ... and author of the book Legend of the Loch . How marvelous . What a pleasure to meet someone who 's done her proper research . I read that you 're still trying to prove the monster exists ... even though it has destroyed your career , demolished your scientific credibility ... and devastated you financially . Apparently , too much research . Professor , these new pictures of the Loch Ness Monster are amazing . I was out on the Loch by myself that day when all of a sudden there she was . Right next to my boat . After the world sees these , everyone will believe in the monster . I wish it were that easy , dear . Dinner is served . I 've prepared a traditional Scottish dinner for you ... so you 'd all get a good taste of the Highlands . And , like , we 're ready to start tasting . Right , Scoob ? - Right . - We 'll be starting with haggis . A true Scottish delicacy . Like , what 's in it ?
zone2	with diced liver and kidneys . Zoinks ! It 's the monster ! That 's no monster , it 's a man . Dear me . Terribly sorry about that . Still , quite a smashing entrance , do n't you think ? Sir Ian , you 've arrived . Welcome to Blake Castle . Yes . Please excuse the window , Shannon , my dear . I found this caber outside , and I could n't resist ... giving it a good toss , for old time 's sake . No , that 'll be fine . Everyone , it 's my honor to introduce ... the Head Field Judge for this year 's Highland Games . Sir Ian Locksley . Director of the Scottish Natural History Museum ... and author of the book Monster my foot . Velma , do you have a book for every occasion ? - Actually , yes . - So , let me get this straight . You 're a museum director and a judge for the games ? Now that 's what I call multitasking . Sir Ian , according to your
zone2	a bunch of hooey . Yes . Hooey , nonsense , poppycock and fiddle-faddle . Now , there you are . You 've got your autograph . And I 've got an entire weekend free ... from any further mention of the Loch Ness ... . Good gravy ! What in the blazes are you doing here ? Hello , Ian . You two know each other ? Ian and I were once colleagues . Colleagues ? Hardly . She was my research assistant . Aye , before you had me fired . I was trying to run a museum . I ca n't have one of my staff spending all their time ... chasing after imaginary monsters . She 's not imaginary , Ian . We 've been through this before . This should be an interesting dinner . I do n't think the two of them will make it past the appetizers . Now , see here . Please , both of you , we 're all sharing the castle tonight . Let 's put our differences aside for now . Have you seen the field , Sir
zone2	my dear . Brilliant . Reminds me of the games of ' 74 . That man has absolutely no regard for true scientific discovery . Like , the only discovery I 'd be interested in is an all-night pizza joint . Yeah ! Pizza joint ! Scoob , with your stomach growling like that ... we 'll never get to sleep . Like , how far is it to the nearest vending machine ? Okay , unless we 're completely lost ... the kitchen should be right around the corner . Did I say kitchen ? I mean , creepy hallway . Okay , like , maybe it 's this way . Zoinks ! Like , wrong turn . It 's okay Scoob , like , just keep telling yourself ... there 's no such things as monsters . There are no monsters . - What is it , Scoob ? - Monster ! Like , boy , do I hope you 're wrong . Look , Scooby-Doo . It 's just a tree branch knocking against that window . That 's nothing to be afraid of . Now ,
zone2	Let 's try down this way . Now , stay close , buddy . We do n't want anything scary sneaking up on ... . Ghost ! Ghost ? Where ? Like , run for it , Scoob ! We did it , Scoob . Safe and sound . Like , zoinks ! I think we just locked ourselves outside of the castle . Look at the bright side , Scoob . At least it 's not raining . Good thinking , old pal . It 'll take more than a rainstorm to dampen our spirits . Like , zoinks ! It 's right outside ! It 's Shaggy and Scooby . Guys , what happened ? Scooby . Stomach . Bats . Kitchen . Rainstorm . Chase . Monster . Yeah , monster . And I thought we Scottish spoke funny . They went searching for a late-night snack ... and were chased down here by the monster . Well , something made these footprints . This is extraordinary . Just what I needed . Fantastic . Curse me kilts , ca n't a man get a decent night
zone2	. No , not the games field . It 's ruined . This is an outrage . Look what you 've done . Like , it was n't our fault . It tried to eat us . We barely survived . Tell me . What tried to eat you ? Like , the Loch Ness Monster . For the last time , there is no such thing ... as the Loch Ness Monster ! But , Ian , look . The proof is all around us . Miss Blake , I do not wish to spend one more moment at Blake Castle . Like , us neither . We 'll call a cab . - Hit it , Scoob . - Taxi . There you go , governor . Step lively . In you go now . Boy , vacations never seem to last , do they ? Do n't forget to write . Are we there yet ? Quick trip . Wait , Sir Ian , wait . Please ! Young lady , you see that you have the game field in order by opening day ... or I
zone2	larger ... than a miniature golf tournament ! Driver . - Well , that did n't go well . - I believe you could say that . - Jinkies ! - What is it , Velma ? The footprints . They do n't lead to the Loch . They lead into town . Why would a sea monster walk along the road ? Well , gang , looks like we 've got another mystery on our hands . Only nobody 's been able to solve this one for 1,500 years . Monster or no monster ... I do n't know how we 'll ever get the game field repaired . Do n't give up yet , Shannon . We just need a little help , that 's all . I 've got it . First thing in the morning , we 'll head into town . I know just the bloke to help us . Here we are , gang . Welcome to Drumna ... . Drummy ... . Dramunono ... . - Drumnadrochit ? - Gesundheit . This little village is so darn cute . Like , total grooviness
zone2	town square ... the Loch Ness Monster , a nice flower garden . Loch Ness Monster ! Take it easy , guys . That 's no monster . It 's just a big balloon filled with helium . - Like , we knew it all along , right , Scoob ? - Yeah ! All along . Come on , lads . Tie her down . Slipped right out of me hands . That 's real funny , Colin . So long , Angus . Do n't forget to write . It 's just a joke , Dad . Hang on , nitwit , I 'm coming . I asked for jocks , and you sent me jokesters instead . From the size of that balloon ... I 'd say you must be the biggest Nessie believer in the world . Me ? No , laddie . Truth is I do not believe in her at all . But the more people that do believe ... the more money she brings to me hotel . Very ... . Mr . Haggart , can we have a word with you ?
zone2	, then ? Should n't you be out at the games field ... keeping an eye out for more of your scary monster sightings ? Laugh if you want , but there may not be any games at all . These photos were taken last night , and the games are tomorrow . The game fields . That can not be ! Whether you believe in the monster or not , Mr . Haggart ... we 're running out of time . Aye , right you are , lass . Boys , come quick . These are for you , mate . - There you go . - Like , thanks . We 've got trouble brewing at Blake Castle . Brace yourselves , lads . I 'm sorry you 've got to see such a thing . Come on , Colin . Let me see . Hold on ! Now round up some help and get down to Blake Castle ... as quick as you can . Yes , Dad . Stupendous ! Tremendous ! Nessie 's trying to tell us something . I 've got to get to
zone2	, Del . Wait . - Waiting time is oversville . She 's trying to talk to me . And I am ready to listen . Please , Del , we 've still got the games to think about . The games ? No , that 's the problem . If it were n't for those games , Nessie would be happy and healthy ... and minding her own business , man . I 've got to get over to Blake Castle ... before those Haggart hooligans get there and ruin the vibe , man . You guys keep on keeping on . Well , good monster hunting ! Do n't be a fool . There 's no such thing as good monster hunting . Like , words to live by . This is our dockmaster , Duncan MacGubbin . Duncan MacGubbin ? I 've heard that name before . You hold the record for the most Loch Ness Monster sightings . Aye , that I do . Forty-one . Though I take no pride in the fact . Since you 're the dockmaster , Mr . MacGubbin ... maybe
zone2	- She said we could take it out on the lake . - That 's loch . Now , there be the Professor 's craft . That 's dock . This Scottish stuff can be complicated . It 's an old fishing boat . She 's nearly as old as meself and twice as leaky . She 'll do ye fine . But I warn ye , do not go looking for trouble 's view . At Loch Ness , trouble can come looking for you . Like , he should be writing scary greeting cards . - I sure wish I 'd brought along my floaties . - So do I . There 's only four life jackets on board . Maybe there 's more down here . - It 's locked from the inside . - That 's strange . I guess two of us will have to stay behind . You mean split up and search for clues ? I like it . Shaggy and Scooby volunteering for shore duty . Aye , aye , Captain . Maybe Shaggy and Scooby should take The Mystery Machine .
zone2	. We wo n't get a scratch on her . Make that two scratches . Suddenly this boat seems like a much safer place . I 'm taking her up to full throttle . Let 's see what this baby can do . Aye , aye , Captain . I 'm king of the lake ... . Loch . Things look pretty clear from up here . You take the high road And I 'll take the rocky road Like , rocky road ice cream , that is Scoob , we going the right way ? Great , as long as we follow the road signs , what can go wrong ? Like , are things getting creepier and spookier , or is it just me ? Me , too . Anything coming up on the sonar , Velma ? Are you kidding ? This sonar system is so old , it could n't pick up a radio station . That 's strange . I know her research funding is limited ... but she 's obviously not spending any of it on new equipment . We might have something .
zone2	Look , something 's moving along the surface . It 's her . She 's back ! Freddie , now would be a good time for one of your famous plans . Got it ! Throw all the nets overboard . Velma , run that line through the yardarm tackle . Aye , aye . You mean , this little boat is going to catch that gigantic monster ? That 's plan " A . " Looks like you got a bite . Okay . - Freddie , what 's plan " B " ? - We 'll head for the shore . - Forward , Fred . - Do n't tell me , tell him ... her , it . We just lost the engine . Look out ! At least we 're cut loose from the monster . Great , we 'll call that plan " C . " Look , the buoys . Oh , boy ! Here she comes ! - She 's gone . - But gone where ? She went under the boat and disappeared . Like , Scoob , old buddy ... I
zone2	. Zoinks ! Like , I think we 're stuck . Look at the size of that pothole . Yikes ! Shaggy ! Look ! Okay , I 'm looking , but I 'm not liking it . It 's only a little salamander . Like , wait , Scoob . We got to stay with the van . Like , I think we lost her , Scoob ... but what happened to the road ? And for that matter , the land ? Like , Houston , we have a problem . Mayday ! That sounds like Shaggy . Shaggy ? Where are you guys ? Like , incoming ! What the heck ? Somebody get that guy 's license . Doggie license ? Are you sure this is where you saw the monster , Shaggy ? Let me see . Like , zoinks ! It 's the monster ! Yeah . This is the place . Look . These monster tracks turn into tire tracks . They sure are n't from The Mystery Machine . Who 's ever heard of a monster with a driver 's license ?
zone2	And the net rigging . - And your refrigerator . What happened to the refrigerator ? - Nothing . - Yeah . Nothing . Do n't worry yourselves none . It was all in the name of research . And it sounds like you had quite the sighting . Sighting ? My eyes were closed the whole time . Me , too . At least the games field is looking good as new . Guess we owe the Haggart brothers a hearty thanks . Yeah , but where are they ? Those jokers ? If goofing off were a Highland Games event ... Colin and Angus would be champions , for sure . Speaking of goofing off , where 's Scooby ? Like , way to go , Scoob . Here , let me have a peek . Okay . Look at that . There 's a groovy ship way out there on the Loch . Shaggy , look . Zoinks ! Ahoy , there . Captain Ian Locksley at your service . Man , like , that barge is on a charge . Oh , dear ! I 'm
zone2	quite all right , Sir Ian . I 'm kind of getting used to this . Yes , of course . That 'll do , then . Secure the bowline . Anchors aweigh ! Like , with Sir Ian around , who needs a monster . Yeah . Well , I should have known . Sir Ian Locksley , a Nessie true believer after all . Believer ? Nonsense , Fiona ! I 'm here to protect the games field . I 'm going to patrol these waters ... to make sure nothing else peculiar happens . Loch Ness is now under my command . I can . And I will . I hereby declare that no boat other than mine ... is to be allowed in the vicinity of Blake Castle . And how could you stop me ? By having that floating scrap pile condemned . Now , I suggest you finish your repairs and be on your way . Blow it out your bagpipe . Why , I never . This boat 's got more surprises in her than you will ever know . Prof . Pembrooke
zone2	for more clues . Brilliant ! Perhaps we 'll make a believer out of him yet . That 's it , men . Weigh the anchor . Zoinks ! Like , I think the anchor 's going to weigh more than usual . This sure is impressive equipment . So multifunctional . Totally . I 've got high score . What happened to my game ? Fred , I think you were playing the digital compass . I still got high score . I 've networked my laptop into the ship 's computer . This way , I can monitor the sonar and download the information . Very well . Say hello to the Ocean Motion 3000 . With it , we can track our position by satellite ... while simultaneously scanning the contour of the Loch floor . - Look ! - McIntyre , report . Sir , target spotted bearing 60 fathoms at 30 knots . It 's nearly 20 meters long . It 's gone ! A target that size surely can not just vanish . There must be some explanation . Whatever it was , it
zone2	Loch Ness is famous for them . I wish there was some way we could check it out . Speaking of checking out ... . Yeah ! Great idea , Scoob . What a groovy hiding spot . Nobody will find us in here . I must say , it looks like your friends fancy my minisub . That would be perfect for exploring the Loch . Would you mind if we borrowed it ? - Do you think you could pilot such a craft ? - Sure . I drove my van into the Loch just yesterday . Scoob , next time I 'm picking the hiding spot . Sorry . Hang on , folks . Once the magnetic arm releases us ... it 's splashdown ! Cool ! This is great ! All it needs is a styling green paint job ... and it 'll be da bomb-diggity . It even has a sonar activated camera . Activating exterior lights . Now , all we need to do is find the entrance to the underwater caves . It 's darker down here than I thought it would be
zone2	Scooby . It 's just a school of eels . Fred , watch where you 're going ! I would , if I could . Look , I think we found the entrance . - Really ? - Really ? It is the cave . And I thought it would be impossible . Nothing 's impossible when you 've got Scooby-Doo around . Shucks ! Is it my imagination or are we in shallow water ? Prepare to surface . - Hello ! - Please do n't do that , Fred . - Why not ? - I 'm afraid something might answer . Yummy , bones ! Scoob , you okay ? Man ! You guys might want to check this out . It looks like Scooby found where Nessie tosses her leftovers . I think we 've stumbled across a burial ground ... used by ancient Scottish warriors . If they buried their dead down here ... that means there must be a secret entrance back up to the surface . Guys , check us out . We 're a couple of brave warriors . Gang , take
zone2	But what 's it doing down here ? Maybe they were handy ancient people . - Freddie . - What ? What would ancient warriors be doing with a modern screwdriver ? Guys , if you think that 's fishy , just look behind you . - Jinkies ! - Get to the submarine . Come on , you two ! - We 're trapped , Scoob ! - No . I guess the only thing we can do now is fight our way out . - Remember , we 're brave warriors . - Yeah , brave . Like , get ready to taste the steel of McShaggy and Scooby McDoo ! She tasted it , and I think she liked it . Let 's get out of here . This place is a real dive . The creature is following us . Like , take the picture , Velma , and let 's go home . We ca n't . The sonar camera is mounted on the front of the sub . We 'll have to turn around if we 're gon na do a photo shoot .
zone2	our portside sensor . - Careful , Freddie . - Sorry . 25 more meters . It 's a straight shot to the surface . - Fred , look out ! - I see it . - She 's gon na ram us . - Hang on . Like , who knew you could get airsick in a submarine ? Great catch , McIntyre . Like , now can we go home ? Gang , with the games starting tomorrow ... we 'd better get some shuteye . Yeah , like , I 'd hate to be tired and cranky during the monster 's final rampage . We ca n't go to bed yet . There are too many unanswered questions . Like , I 've got one . What is that noise ? It 's coming from inside The Mystery Machine . Del ? - I think he 's sleeping on your poncho . - That 's okay , he can keep it . Hey , guys . Sorry , I was down here at the castle ... you know , trying to connect with Nessie 's energy ...
zone2	Your van 's been stolen ? - From Blake Castle ? Like , wow , and it seemed like such a good neighborhood . We 've got to solve this mystery tonight . And I know just the person to help us do it . Prof . Pembrooke , come in , Professor . Do you read me ? She should n't be out on the Loch alone , especially tonight . - I hope nothing has happened to her . - She 's probably just out of range . She could be all the way down at the other end of the Loch by now . - Maybe she 's following the monster . - Or maybe it 's following us . Yeah , you want some of this ? Come and get it , you overgrown lizard . Technically , Freddie , the monster would n't be a lizard . Lizards are ectothermic ... whereas this monster is clearly amphibious . Not the time , Velma . Hello , governor . Care for a sweep of the old chimney , then ? Hold on ! Daphne , I
zone2	. That 's not my sweater . - It 's a peat bog . You 've got to stop . - No problem . Guys , she 's coming ! This is the moment I 've waited for my whole life ! I think we need to take a closer look at this monster . Jeepers ! This is one sea serpent that could use some moisturizer . That 's not skin , it 's canvas . Grab on . Del 's van ! She 's not real ? But ... . My van ! - There 's no one inside . - They must have escaped . Check it out , gang . Del 's treads match the tire tracks we found earlier . So , someone 's been using my wheels ... to fake us out this whole time ? But this does n't add up . Del 's van could n't have chased us through the underwater tunnels . Or attacked us on the boat . And Shaggy and Scooby were chased by the creature last night . Before Del 's van was stolen . - This
zone2	monster . So Nessie 's still out there . Right on . Nessie or no Nessie , this van hoax proves ... there 's somebody behind at least part of this mystery . There 's only one thing left to do . Take a two-week vacation to a tropical paradise ? Yeah , like , the Bahamas . No , you chickens , we 've got to head back to Blake Castle . I 've got a plan . Really , Scoob , is there anything we wo n't do for Scooby Snacks ? Shaggy and Scooby are in position . Is everyone else ready ? Sonar 's up and running . Everything is clear outside the cove . We 're standing by . Over . - Fred , how 's the trap coming ? - Roger that , Mama Bird . This is Baby Bird and we do have copy . We are go . Alpha , Bravo , Charlie . Baby Bird , over and -- Yeah . Hi , it 's Del . We 're ready , Velma . Hang on , I think we got a
zone2	lost visual on Scooby and Shaggy . Velma to Shaggy , come in , Shaggy . Are you two okay ? Negatory on that , Velma . We got a major problem down here . Like , we 're all out of Scooby Snacks . Sir Ian , you better come take a look at this . There it is again . It 's heading right into the cove . - Good gravy . - I 'll call Velma . Let 's not be hasty . McIntyre , what 's going on ? What ? No , you ca n't do this . This is mutiny . Forgive me , Sir Ian ... but I 've come up with a little plan of my own . I intend to capture that creature and sell it ... for quite a handsome amount of cash . Catch it ? How are you going to catch it ? The old-fashioned way . Like , I ca n't see a thing . This fog is so thick you could cut it with a knife . Scoob , what do you say we sit back-to-back
zone2	- Okay . I 'd like to see old Fang-Fins try to sneak up on us . - Right , old buddy ? - Yeah . Jinkies ! The monster is in the cove . Repeat . The monster is in the cove . Tie off your end , Del . I 'm going across . Hit it , man ! Shaggy and Scooby . Can you guys hear me ? Shaggy here . Who 's calling ? It 's Velma . Now listen . You 're right on top of it . Like , thanks for the compliment . Scoob , Velma says we 're right on top of things . No , Shaggy , listen . It 's really beneath you . You know , I 've always thought being live bait was beneath us , too . - Me . - Hang on , Velma . Scooby wants to say hi . - Wait ! - Hi , Velma . Scooby , listen . Your boat is on top of the monster 's head . Velma , like , I think we found the monster . Hang
zone2	You heard him , Scoob . Hang on . Nice job , Fred . The monster 's trapped in the cove . How about that , Velma . One of our traps worked ... without some unforeseen detail going horribly wrong . Freddie , look behind you . Watch out , Freddie ! He 's got a harpoon ! - Buddy , need a lift ? - How far are you going ? - Target in range ! - Excellent . Fire ! Jinkies ! Abandon ship ! Hit the brakes ! - Help ! - Sir Ian . Throw me a line ! I ca n't swim ! We 've got to do something . Hang on , Sir Ian ! Help is on the way ! I do n't believe my eyes . She is real . Who ever heard of a magnet stopping a sea monster ? Help ! This place is infested with monsters . Guys , look out ! That 's where we set the ... trap . Scooby ! Shaggy ! Are you guys okay ? Terrific , considering we 're squashed under the
zone2	so . Take another look . Colin and Angus Haggart ? So if this one 's a fake , like , what about that one ? Time for this monster to hit the beach . Prof . Fiona Pembrooke ? It 's all very simple . Prof . Pembrooke has been behind this all along . She did a good job . Scoob and I have been scared all along . The locked hatch we found on board her vessel ... was actually a secret passageway . It led to her homemade monster submarine ... she kept docked beneath her boat . She 'd simply climb down the hatch and pedal off into the Loch . That way she could be free to do her scaring ... while we all thought she was on the boat . But it was n't Shannon she was after , or any of us . It was really Sir Ian 's attention she wanted . Me ? What do I have to do with any of this ? She was using fake monsters to get you to believe in a real one . Exactly
zone2	yourself . But she could n't count on Nessie making an appearance ... so she created her own . And she hired Angus and Colin to help her . Your sons were trying to scare away the athletes ... so they could win the Games . - It 's not true . - We do n't even care about the Games . We just like a good practical joke . That monster thing 's the greatest joke we ever pulled . Aye , lots better than the hedgehog in the toilet bowl . I should have prayed harder for daughters . It 's true . Ian would never have looked at my new photos ... unless he came to believe in the beast . She had to find a way to convince him ... and the Highland Games at Blake Castle offered her the perfect opportunity . Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to Blake Castle ... and to the Loch Ness Highland Games . And here to help us kick off the events is a very special member of the Blake clan . Please welcome Miss Daphne Blake . Let
zone2	a drum major could be so major . Fred , like , The Mystery Machine looks good as new . Miss Blake ! I demand to know what 's going on . Sir Ian , what is the matter ? All of you , down to the ship . That 's an order ! Aye , aye , Captain . - Another Pembrooke hoax , that 's all it is . - But where 's it coming from ? The sonar camera from the minisub . It 's still transmitting a signal . But , like , did n't that camera fall off the submarine and sink ? Something must have passed in front of the lens ... and reactivated the sonar sensor . - Do n't be ridiculous . - Can you get a fix on the signal ? Now , see here . Quadrant four . Depth : 104 fathoms . But that 's over 600 feet below . Much too deep for any homemade submarine to survive . It ca n't possibly be . I mean , really . Show him your pictures . Sir Ian ,
zone2	, here . Great Scott . These are fantastic . Miss Blake , I 'm terribly sorry ... but I must resign from my post as games judge , effective immediately . Ian , you mean , you actually believe me ? The evidence will , of course , have to be verified by a third party . Check it out ! These are great . What are you using here ? Wide-angle lens , right ? Very well , grab your bags , both of you . We 've got a lot of work ahead of us . Chop-chop . We do n't want to lose her again . Aye , aye , man . It looks like you 've got another mystery on your hands . And none of this would have been possible without you meddling kids . We try . Cousin , I believe ... we 've just given Blake Castle its wildest story ever . - Thank you , for everything , Shannon . - No , thank you . None of this could have been possible without you and your great friends . Like
zone2	called " The long-distance Daphne Blake suitcase carry . " Gang , that was some mystery . I 'm actually kind of glad we never found the real Loch Ness Monster . - You are ? Why ? - I do n't know . Maybe some mysteries are just better left unsolved . Scooby-Dooby Doo ?
zone2	3367118 With music you want to penetrate the listener . Penetrate to the point where you reach ... what Miles Davis used to call ... spiritual orgasm . That 's bullshit . See , that 's all part of just the Miles Davis myth . Miles Davis was trying to make some money . Miles Davis was so great , to see him grovel before ... these commercial arenas by the end of his life was really very difficult . So people had to say , " Oh no , no , Miles did n't sell out ... he 's moving ahead . " I have n't heard myself play in the 1940 's or 50 's ... in forty years . You know , having gone back to listen to myself again . Miles , what are you gon na open with now ... what are you gon na play first ? So What . Miles has laryngitis so I have to interpret his whispering . The great Miles Davis Quintet , here they are . It might have a little more resonance , a little more ... fullness and brighter . But since they have synthesizers and electric
zone2	So musicians learn a lotfaster . What happened was I walked into the studio ... and I looked around for the acoustic piano and I did n't see one . So I just kinda waited around and I thought ... " What does Miles want me to play ? " So I asked him , I says ... " Miles , what do you want me to play ? " He says , " Play that over there . " And I looked over in the corner , there was a Fender Rhodes electric piano . And so I thought , " He wants me to play that toy ? " Mind you , I had never played the Fender Rhodes piano . So I turned the thing on , and ... I played a chord on it . And to my great surprise , I thought it sounded beautiful . I loved the sound of it . It was rich , it was mellow ... and it was a nice kind of blending sound . For my first six months in the band , I did play piano .
zone2	one of these in front of me . I actually did n't ... it was something new to me ... and I would come across an instrument like this ... that kind of sounded like that . I thought ... " What is this ? " I did n't know what it was . I did n't quite know what to do with it . But he was hearing something ... which he did n't describe to me too much ... he justwanted me to play it . And then I got turned on to ... these little modules that you could distort the sound with . Miles was going to rock/bass/electric sounds ... towards the elements that were more in pop music and rock music . That reverb that the ... the tape delay . Bitches Brew was the album that when I first heard it ... I thought I was going to climb the walls and climb across the ceiling . I was on the floor beating my hands and feet , I could hardly take it . It was so intense . It was everything that I
zone2	It was ... everything that I had hoped to hear was ... revealed in Bitches Brew . When Bitches Brew came out I listened to it over and over . I listened to it ... stone-cold sober . I listened to it a little , with a little change in my consciousness . I listened to it with a great change in my consciousness . In fact I completely altered my consciousness to try to like it . I tried to like it because it was him . And I could n't believe that it was what I heard . Because it was just these formous long pieces ... that seemed to go nowhere . After a while I felt like somebody had my hand tied down to a table ... and was slowly driving nails through it , there was nothing I could do about it ... except listen to the hammer hit the nail . Boom ! Not again . Bam ! No , not that . To Stanley Crouch and people like that ... they need to be reminded that it takes courage ... to leave all
zone2	parachute . This is why I adore Miles . Because he would not tap-dance for anybody , like Sammy Davis , Jr ... . with all respect to Sammy Davis , Jr . and Michael Jackson ... they 're more like entertainers . Miles Davis was not an entertainer . He was a seriously brutal artist , musician ... who would not comply ... with the plastic system . I do changes , but I ca n't help it , you know . Not that I 'm a genius . But it 's just that I ca n't help it . I play it one way so long I just have to change my way ... in order to give it to you . So you 'll like it . So he got rid of the Italian suits , and he started wearing ... a different kind of clothing . And it all happened at the same time . Psychologically I think the people who put it to him ... that he needed to change if he was tired of playing clubs ... four concerts a night , for very
zone2	was like ... Clide Davis , Mr . Clide Davis , Mr . Bill Graham ... and of course Betty Davis . She was this young , beautiful Black woman that ... with this fire , spirit and freshness ... that kind of opened Miles ' eyes up . Wayne Shorter , Herbie , Ron , Tony . And then you put out this record which is essentially a jam session ... and it becomes the top selling jazz record of all time at the time . On top of that you get , you do the Fillmore ... and you 're on the Newsweek magazine ... and within the space of seven months ... from March , April , May , June , July , August , six months ... he played the Isle ofWight . Half a million people , minimum . Playing opposite Hendrix ... all those pop acts at the time who were on the scene at that moment . For Miles Davis that 's as high as any jazz musician ever got in this world ... a guy playing that kind of music . I
zone2	... a pure result of consciousness revolution music . " Hell no , we wo n't go to Vietnam " ... and " We shall overcome " , which was a ... the 60 's was probably the most important decade ... Iate 60 's early 70 's ... was the most important decade in the 20th century . Why ? Because it gave birth to questioning authority ... if it 's not enlightened by God . Are you listening , George Bush ? You know , we said " Hi " ... but I do n't think Miles really first knew what to do with ... a woman except drag her into his lair . Folk music and jazz occupied the same room at different times ... and there was an overlap sometimes . The point we differed on was electronic music . And I already went through this in the folk circles ... like Pete Segert crying when Bob plugged in . People are afraid that they ca n't make that change . Not everybody is fluid and changeable ... I am , Miles is , some people
zone2	have to be ready to experience massive rejection . Listen a minute , will you ? Will you listen a minute ! Now listen , a lot of people who get up here and sing , I know it 's fun ... it 's a lot offun . It 's fun for me ... I get my feelings off through my music . But you 've got your life wrapped up in it . Give us some respect . Most of music , pop music , it 's like they get these formula chords ... or people like these chords , and so they play them ad nauseum . Music is when you pull the chords from your inner core ... whether they sound weird to people or not . And anyone adventuresome is doing that , and Miles certainly was adventuresome . We were human and they let everybody after that do their thing . Everybody was interested in playing with Miles ... because he was the number one band . The Isle ofWight , like I said ... that was about my third concert with the band .
zone2	music he had been playing in the band before . Now once I joined the band we were on our way ... to play different music . I was coming from a totally acoustic , you know ... I had n't dealt with electricity . Initially , electricity , well that 's something you getfrom ... But in reality , electricity is life itself ... so how can I say ... that I 'm not into electricity when I 'm electric , we 're all are electric . Miles did n't change through the years , he got better I think ... but as far as musically he did n't change ... things around him changed . The world changed . Ok , so what 're you gon na do ? The world changes ... you 're gon na still wear the clothes that you wore back in the 40 's . You know , you keep up . So he just kept up , that 's all . Most of what we did was an improvisation , it was a jam . Miles had certain themes that he would
zone2	groove . And then he may have some melodic themes on the top ... and then he would just set a mood . I think there 's a certain point where you have so many people out there ... that it no longer means anything in a way , I do n't know . We got on stage and we started playing . And you 're this very small event in this huge space of things that are going on . And the sound is coming from all over the place ... and so there 's a sort of detachment that happens sometime in those live concerts . That 's differentfrom the more intimate venues ... but it was a stunning sight to see that . As far as I was concerned , every time Miles put the horn to his lips ... it was a great event . The bass player has a tremendous responsibility I think in the music ... to create a center , a focus , within the music that Miles was creating . But how you do that can change tremendously from ... one musical
zone2	influenced by the things that I heard ... around me at those times . WhatJack Bruce was doing with The Cream ... whatJimi was doing with his band , you know . And of course , there was also the influence of James Brown 's music ... and a lot of the other things that were going on at that time . Miles ' music was crossing over there at that point . So he was reaching a larger audience . And a lot of the rock musicians were really also ... getting turned on to Miles and really ... it was a great meeting of musical cultures . The drummer was the anchor ... the function of laying down the groove , especially in that electric period . Laying down the groove and also embellishing the groove . Keeping a steady pulse , but changing it , shifting it ... making subtle changes in it . And providing the ... the fire , the stoke in the fire . Putting the heat on . Putting colors on top of what I was doing . The first thing that I
zone2	? ca " , it 's called " cu ? ca " . And actually Miles used to love this sound . We used to play off each other . When he went ... I went ... And I know he liked it . Even though he never told me ... but I know he liked it . We flew to the site ... and it was very incredible to look , to see all the people ... on the roads and everything . Off the roads they were like ants , it was incredible . And we were right there in the middle of everything . Before us I think it was Tiny Tim . And then they announced Miles Davis and band ... and then I just walked in on stage ... and that was it , we played that beautiful concert that was incredible . And it 's incredible that I can remember that because ... I was pretty out at that time . " Are you in a trance ? " That 's a good question . This is the limit of what two hands can
zone2	other place which you might term a trance . You can actually do things you hear ... that are so unrelated to your instrument ... that they are frightening to even yourself . Miles probably knew that I did n't even want to get near an electric piano ... but he might have fiigured that if I wanted to play with him ... I 'd show up and I 'd play whatever was on stage . So when Chick was in the band , Chick was playing a Fender piano . And when Miles heard I was coming they had to get a second instrument ... so that was an organ . I was n't sure which one I hated more . What I thought I was bringing to the band was energy . I was n't bringing music to the band , I was n't bringing ... any special cleverness . Or I was n't writing material . But energy , energy and the quality of energy is what makes music ... powerful . The funkiness and ... the sort of primal stuff that he wanted was finally coming
zone2	the same tracks over and over and over . Does n't matter how , even if it 's a bad night , you 're listening to this sound . But what is that , I think was his ... his ... that 's the trance , I mean he was ... doing something a trumpet was n't supposed to be able to actually do . Some effect to your body when you listened was being achieved . If you see a band who 's working on this thing ... and they 're all willing to be ignorant of it ... even though their heads are very together . Every second they 're willing themselves to be ignorant ... of exactly what it is that 's coming next ... then that 's something to see . When I see Miles play a note ... how he comes at that note is not on a CD , you know . I believe that on this little 37 minute fiilm ... is a micro history lesson in Jazz ... and it 's just coming out of Miles ' horn . There are these
zone2	... a Dixieland moment in the thing . And when I heard that I thought , " This is compressed into this one set . " People are hearing almost where the whole thing came from ... where everything that 's happened until that moment in time ... came from , including all the modern stuff . I can tell by the reaction that it was a triumph ... for Miles Davis to play in probably one of the biggestfestivals ... along with Woodstock ... and converted a lot of people into ... multidimensional consciousness . Isle ofWight is ... is a masterpiece . If you had something that was a tribute to Miles , what would it be ? I spent the days after his death ... doing a portrait of him , which I frequently do when ... I lose somebody I cared for . Wayne took a look at the painting and he said ... " Well , you painted him kind of blue . " His skin tone , ' cause he had that magnifiicent mahogany color . In my rendition of it was kind of
zone2	he 'd always find like a resting place . You know , so it 's ... He would take you on a journey whether you wanted to or not ... if you listen , Miles was the epitome of like , what he used to say ... " lf you listen , I got you . All it takes is for you to just listen a little bit ... and I 'll take you to a different place . " Play a tribute to Miles by myself , without hearing his sound ... it 's a little sad , but ... I could go let 's say ... I could go ... I could n't pick a piece ... because Miles is all of the pieces . It 's his interpretation ... of whatever elements ... he has to deal with ... that is Miles ' genius . So to me there is n't necessarily a particular piece ... that was written before . Whatever is written now ... to me , is what Miles ' was about .
zone2	3312121 Move . What makes a movie a movie is the editing . I 've been in the business for , I do n't know , 37 years , I think . Something like that . I did not really realize what editing was until I was in the editing room myself . There 's magic to editing . Magic is a discovery ... of something new that was n't intended that works for the movie . Once you start to realize that film is the sum of editing ... then editing is the thing you 're always looking at . Showtime , folks . I think great editing skill ... will protect a director from suicide . The first filmmakers simply photographed what interested or amused them . They held a shot until they got bored or the film ran out . The fathers of cinema , Edison in the United States ... and the Lumi ? re brothers in France ... were very pessimistic about the future of cinema . There was probably a worldwide interest ... in seeing these images move ... but once you 'd seen somebody playing a joke with a hose ... why pay
zone2	out in the street ? In fact , Auguste Lumi ? re went as far as to say ... that cinema was an invention without a future . But Edwin Porter , one of Thomas Edison 's employees ... proved him wrong . Porter discovered that cutting separate shots together ... could create a story . Edwin S . Porter really was the one with The Life of an American Fireman ... I think , that started intercutting ... and creating an emotional impact on the audience ... by intercutting two shots that are not related to each other . One scene is going on at one place ... basically , the firemen rushing to a fire with their horse-drawn wagons ... and the other scene is the fire , miles away . You intercut the two and you understand , psychologically and emotionally ... that these people 's lives are in danger ... and these people are coming to rescue them ... and you 're rooting , all of a sudden , for that to happen ... and you 're hoping they save the people . I often think
zone2	... to create the art form as it was happening ... and say , " Why do n't we try this ? " " That does n't make sense . " We do it in the editing room now . We cut to something and say , " That does n't work . " Imagine what they must have said in 1904 . The Great Train Robbery was Porter 's next film . That 's when you really begin to see the possibilities . I 'm not saying this because I 'm an editor , but the invention of editing ... is the thing that allowed film to take off . It 's the equivalent of the invention of flight . Both human-powered flight and motion-picture editing ... were invented in the same year , and they have similar kinds of effects . The invention of editing gave birth to a new art and a new language ... a language that can transport us in the blink of an eye ... from the vastness of the desert to the mysteries of the human face . A cut can bridge millions
zone2	imaginary future . Editing can slow down time ... or speed it up . The timing of a cut can startle audiences ... or amuse them . ... with a long knife trailing after me . I am in great danger . I 'll never let go . I promise . The choice and length of shots ... shape our response to everything we see on the screen . And editing is why people like movies . Because in the end , would n't we like to edit our own lives ? I think we would . I think everybody would like to take out the bad parts ... take out the slow parts , and look deeper into the good parts . I started working on what used to be called ... the upright Moviola , which is an editing machine ... that looks something like a green sewing machine on legs . I switched to computer editing in the mid ' 90s . The editor is sort of the ombudsman for the audience . As an editor , you only see what is on the screen ... not
zone2	and that 's how it 's gon na look to the audience . I make it a principle not to go on the set ... not to see the actors out of costume ... not to see anything other than ... the images that come to me from location . A major Hollywood production shoots almost 200 hours of film . Unspooled , the film would stretch from L.A . To Vegas . An editor may work for months , even years ... crafting this footage into a two-hour movie . The finished film will contain thousands of shots ... each measured in frames of one-twenty-fourth of a second . For a writer , it 's a word . For a composer or a musician , it 's a note . For an editor and a filmmaker , it 's the frames . The one frame off or two frames added ... or two frames less ... is the difference between a sour note and a sweet note ... is the difference between ... clunky , clumsy crap ... and orgasmic rhythm . Verna Fields made many good contributions to
zone2	Cutter ... because she was very earthy and very maternal . She cut her films at her house , in her pool house ... in the San Fernando Valley ... and it was a very haimish kind of a workplace . The shark did n't work as well ... or as often as it was supposed to work according to the screenplay . That 's the spot . We had a contest where Verna would stop the Moviola on a frame ... where she wanted to make the cut , and I 'd stop it where I wanted it . If ever we stopped it on the same frame ... that had already been marked with a grease-pencil " X " ... we knew that was the right frame on certain things where we did n't agree . All of our disagreements always happened with that darn shark . Verna was always in favor of making less to be more . And I was trying to squeeze that one more ... ' Cause it took me days to get the one shot . So I 'm going back to ...
zone2	get the shark to look real ... and the sad fact was ... the shark would only look real in 36 frames , not 38 frames . And that two-frame difference ... was the difference between something really scary ... and something that looked like a great white floating turd . Out of my way . Well , I got so desperate on Terminator 2 ... trying to shorten that film to a manageable length ... as we all understand that to be ... that I said , " Wait a minute , do we need all these frames ? " If we just took out one frame every second for the entire film ... " we 'd shorten the film by a couple of minutes . " Let 's just do it as a test . " We 'll take a reel and we 'll take out one frame in every 24 . " And the editors looked at me like I was nuts . " Let 's just try it . Come on . Nobody 's ever done this . " We took out one frame in every
zone2	jerks , there were things , there were cuts in the wrong places . You totally saw it and it just did n't work . Every one of those individual frames was important . Once you know that as an editor , now you get scared for a while . It 's like , " Jeez , am I cutting here or am I cutting here ? " But then after a while , you start to realize that there 's great power in that , too . D.W . Griffith was the first great filmmaker ... to understand the psychological importance of editing . Working a decade after Porter , he did more than anyone else ... to advance the storytelling tools Porter had developed . Griffith invented and popularized techniques ... that established the basic grammar of film . His melodramas were the first to draw audiences ... into the emotional world of his characters . He certainly was the first man to use the close-up in a big way . It was so revolutionary that the producers , when they saw this , were aghast . They
zone2	like this . " You ca n't cut to this big , ugly shot of somebody . " We 're paying for this actor , this actress . We wan na see their whole body . " We do n't wan na just see their face . " Second of all , the audiences wo n't know what to respond to . " They 're gon na be all confused . " Well , the proof is in the pudding and the reality is ... that the audiences were not confused at all . Griffith brought it together in one magnificent film , The Birth of a Nation ... and we saw the accumulation of 10 years of editing knowledge ... put into a movie . And all of a sudden , you not only had close-ups ... but you had flashbacks ... parallel action ... and you had all sorts of things being used to make the audience ... keep attention focused on a certain part of the frame . D.W . Griffith established the tenets of classical film editing . And classical film editing relied on the concept
zone2	be continuous and fluid and moving . The goal was to mask the cut so the audience would n't notice ... and could forget that they were watching a movie . Let 's take another look . Notice how the gesture matches from one shot to the next ? Griffith 's seamless editing is still practiced today ... and was the dominant editing style in Hollywood movies for decades . At last . Look again . The cut is so smooth that it 's barely noticeable . It 's all for telling the story . And all you wan na do is get the person emotionally invested in the story . So it becomes this invisible craft . We call it " the invisible art . " And , indeed , it is . I mean , the more invisible we are , the better we 're doing our job . Unfortunately , the invisible style of editing ... kept editors invisible and unappreciated as well . For years they have been the best-kept secret of the movies . The first cutters were considered hands for hire ... rather than
zone2	the images by holding the film up to the light . Then they would check their work by running it through a projector ... and making the necessary adjustments . Griffith 's main cutter was Jimmy Edward Smith ... who virtually lived with him at the studio ... where they worked far into the night running the film shot during the day . Later , Smith 's wife Rose joined the editing team . The Smiths married during the cutting of intolerance . For their honeymoon , Griffith allowed them the weekend off . - Lights . - Needs about 20 minutes out of it . The Kazan film The Last Tycoon had a wonderful scene . It was obviously the story of Irving Thalberg . And I always took that as a wonderful metaphor ... about the editing process . It 's silent , it 's anonymous . What 's Eddie , asleep ? The goddamn movie even puts the editor to sleep . He 's not asleep , Mr . Brady . What do you mean he 's not asleep ? He 's dead , Mr . Brady
zone2	? He must have died ... How can he be dead ? We were just watching the rough cut . Jesus , I did n't hear anything . Did you hear anything ? Not a thing . Eddie ... he probably did n't want to disturb the screening , Mr . Brady . Today , not only is the editor still alive ... but he has become the director 's key collaborator . No other crew member ... spends as much time working alone with the director . Finding the relationship with the editor ... is like trying to decide whether or not to get married . Because if the marriage is n't a good one , it 's gon na be a sticky divorce . When I was doing my first movie ... the only thing I knew is I wanted a female editor . ' Cause I just felt a female editor would be more nurturing ... to the movie and to me . They would n't try to be winning their way just to win their way . They would n't be trying to shove their agenda
zone2	nurturing me through this process . - Give me your hand ! - She killed me , man . Who would 've fucking thought that ? I think editors play a big role with directors in giving them support ... making them feel ... like they can look at something that may have trouble or problems ... and be comfortable enough so that they can approach those problems . Hi , Vincent . I 'm getting dressed . In the beginning , he really does n't guide me ... and then I put together what I think he wants . And pretty much , we 've worked together so long , I can judge what he would want . - What the fuck is this place ? - This is Jack Rabbit Slim 's . An Elvis man should love it . - Come on , man , let 's go get a steak . - You can get a steak here , Daddy-O . Do n't be a ... After you , kitty cat . Initially , I had it really long . It was like a date in
zone2	kind of , you know ... little by little , convince me to bring it down ... and it still could be funny . You 'd still have what I 'm talking about , but maybe it would n't be so painful . He did want it to feel very much like a date ... and it was very long at first ... and we just had to kind of live with it for a while . Just like , you know , letting me live with it long enough ... so I could eventually , " I 've had it enough . I 've seen that enough . " Maybe now I can lose this part . " Okay , so it was like here , and now it 's like here . " Finally , we bring it down , and then I brought it too far down ... and then he said , " We got ta bring it back up . " " That 's it . No more . This is not a video . " We do that for eight months , so intense
zone2	sometimes I get annoyed with her for not reading my mind 100% . It 's not good enough that she reads it 80% of the time , all right . We work very intensely together ... and it 's kind of amazing that we still like each other . If I was with my husband that long , I do n't think I 'd like him that much . By the time I 've thought of an idea , written it ... found the financing , cast the film , directed it ... I get to the cutting room and it 's like I 've washed up on shore . I 'm so happy to be there , ' cause then I think : " Now we can start making the film . " It 's so hard to be a director , and it 's hard on the set . By the time they come into the cutting room the first week ... they 're usually half the people they were when they started out . They 're shells of the people they were . And at least in
zone2	easygoing ... and try to heal them back into shape so that they can get to work on the movie . When Matthew Broderick is busted from having thrown the election ... in Election ... he enters the principal 's office ... and sees all the people gathered there who know he 's guilty . Mr . McAllister , I hope you can help us clear something up . He wanted to cut it like the end sequence of The Good , the Bad and the Ugly ... with holding on the faces for a really long time with the swelling music . And I was like , " No , let 's cut it really fast and build to a climax . " And I did n't wan na do that . It was cheesy and would call too much attention to itself . And he just would n't wan na do it . He would n't wan na put it in the movie like that . So finally , I said , " I 'll pay you $25 . " And I said , " No , let
zone2	" Okay , $50 . " - And I said , " No . " He 's like , " No . " And I said , " $75 . " So he even gave me an invoice , and it says that I owe him $75 . So I paid him $75 to cut it in . And that 's how it is now . I think successful editors ... are really sly politicians . The Russian Revolution sparked a revolution in film editing as well . The crazy Russians start fucking around with images ... and juxtaposing them and creating different emotional effects . Lenin saw film as the perfect medium ... to inspire his largely illiterate nation to join the Revolution . They took these films out in the middle of the farmlands ... and showed them to the farmers and peasants . They began to understand ... that they could get a certain emotional , psychological effect ... by a certain type of cutting from one image to the next . And that became a manipulation of what the audience was feeling . The Russian filmmakers
zone2	Griffith . Instead of melodrama , they offered real life . To make the film Man with a Movie Camera ... documentary filmmaker Dziga Vertov and his team ... took his cameras into the streets to record a typical day in Moscow . It 's constantly reminding me that I 'm watching a movie . There were scenes inside an editing room . You see how they edited movies back in 1929 . They were engaged in a pure explosion of creative activity ... in manipulating these images . Every modern editing convention that we know of ... is demonstrated in Man with a Movie Camera . The film celebrated not just the Revolution ... but the role of the cameraman and the editor in helping to create it . Vertov and his wife Elizaveta cut their documentaries and newsreels ... in dark basements with rats scuttling underfoot . But in this film ... he made the editor as important as any other worker in the Revolution . The theoretician Lev Kuleshov also experimented with film editing . In his most famous study ... he took a shot of a
zone2	; a bowl of hot soup ... a distraught woman draped across her husband 's coffin ... and a little girl playing with a teddy bear . When audiences saw the film , they raved about the actor 's performance . ; how hungrily he looked at the soup ... how sorrowfully he gazed at the woman ... and how tenderly he watched the little girl . But , actually , it was the same expression each time . Now this demonstrates the power of juxtaposition ... the power of montage ... by taking one shot and another shot to give it a third meaning . And the third meaning is , in effect , an emotion that 's much greater ... than the sum total of the two parts that put it together in the first place . And this is the basis of all editing , by the way . One of Kuleshov 's contemporaries , Sergei Eisenstein ... combined these experiments with Marxist ideology ... to create films of revolutionary fervor . He saw editing , like history , as a clash of images and ideas .
zone2	themselves ... but in their collision . " When two elements are in conflict , " he argued ... " their collision sparks a new meaning of higher order . " Where Griffith tried to hide his cuts , Eisenstein reveled in them . He wanted the audience to feel the frame ... to know that this is a movie , not life . Eisenstein is the first real director . He killed himself in his staging ... he killed himself with his camerawork and everything ... but it was all at the service of the scissors ... every little , single , solitary bit of it . I got a movie projector when I was 11 ... and one of the first movies I got was The Battleship Potemkin . I just ran that Odessa Steps sequence over and over again . I could n't believe what I was seeing . One of the things that makes it incredible is the editing ... the incredible juxtaposition of images . What the Russians did was a response to what Griffith had done . Classical editing , and now , Eisensteinian
zone2	American cinema has absorbed all of that stuff from the Russians ... and now it 's in our film . The fact is that many of these techniques have been appropriated ... into what we do every day as editors right here in Hollywood , California ... making action pictures ... because we are also trying to get a response from the audience . We 're also trying to get them to rise out of their seats ... out of their complacency ... but not necessarily for revolutionary purposes ... but just to really have a great time in the movies . Do n't you fucking move ! Editing techniques the Soviets used to convert their population to Communism ... now drive Hollywood 's action blockbusters . - Where 's the shot ? - What shot ? - Who took out the shot ? - Which shot is that ? The money shot . Bus driver 's head . The brains-on-the-window shot . The bits-are-on-the-visor shot . We thought we 'd show it to you like this without all that ... Put it back . Do n't " show "
zone2	're not even giving it a chance . How 's the rearview-mirror gag supposed to work without it ? Am I the only one here who respects the writing ? You 've got suspense and you 've got action . I found a good combination in the two Terminator films ... was to have a suspenseful build-up to an action release . In Terminator 2 ... you have a slow , tense build-up of these characters moving around ... closing in on the young John Connor . Then he sees the Terminator for the first time and it 's all in slow motion . I usually like to use the slow motion in the build-up ... where it has this kind of protracted , dream-like or nightmarish quality ... and then there 's a cathartic break , and then it kicks into gear . Get down . In a chase , something is going right or something is going wrong . And you wan na accentuate that . Rhythm is one of the ways you do that . You also wan na create peaks and valleys in terms of rhythm
zone2	an editor . I would n't want to do them as a steady diet ... but every now and then , it 's great fun . My favorite chase that I 've ever worked on was the Canal Chase ... as we called it , in Terminator 2 . Our ancestors were survivors . Therefore , we 're here . And so there 's something plugged into our reptilian hindbrain ... that makes us relate to the idea of being pursued and getting away . So we get to go through these kind of cathartic simulator runs ... while we watch a movie ... and we get to experience that heart-pounding fear of being chased . It 's a natural form of excitement . Editing can hone that , sharpen that . The tempo of the cuts , the variety of shots that are used . The changing image sizes of the character 's reactions , eyes . All these things are in the palette . By manipulation and juxtaposition ... you can increase the excitement . This is the first thing : I 'm standing up ... which allows
zone2	it also means that I 'm " sprung . " I guess that 's the only word for it . And frequently , when I 'm looking at the cut ... I will stand here ... with my hand on the controls almost like a gunslinger ... and trying to hit the point of the cut ... with my knees bent . And somehow , this is important for me ... because it allows me to internalize the rhythms ... the visual rhythms of what 's happening . At this point , we 've started with a blank slate . So , the question is , what are we gon na start with ? That looks like a good possibility . It establishes things . So there 's Anthony saying , " Action , " and they start to come forward . We could begin it anywhere in here ... but see , there now , somebody falls right here . And that 's good . Falling is good . We will edit this shot into the timeline . There it is . In the end , there will be
zone2	them ... have to ultimately be the right shot ... in the right place , for the right length of time . When I was watching Nosferatu when I was a kid ... our main guy is up in the castle , and night has fallen ... and we 're very suspicious something 's about to happen ... and we see Nosferatu down the hall . That section is what scared me the most . And in terms of editing , it caught my attention because of this : We saw this vampire with pointy teeth and scary eyes ... very far away down a hallway , and then we cut to our guy . He 's very scared , and we cut back . He 's six feet away from us . He 's just on the other side of the door . Every time I saw it , I was very scared . And I remember waiting for that moment of being surprised . When people come into a theater ... they 're already keenly aware of their own fears . It 's like , " Let 's
zone2	. " The screen being the fire . We 'll sit in a circle . We 'll be in the darkness . We 'll be in a dreamlike state . We 'll be connected to strangers ... in a way that we 're normally not in the rest of our culture . And we 'll feel things in unison . The opening sequence of Scream is almost a film in itself . It is kind of whacking the audience upside the head in 15 minutes ... where you introduce a character , develop her , endear her to the audience ... and then kill her unexpectedly . That 's a matter of yourself and your editor sitting there and thinking : " What is that audience , that phantom audience ... " that you imagine in your mind , thinking ? " It 's all judgment calls . It 's all about rhythm . It 's all about getting that part of it right ... so that there 's no moment where they feel quite easy ... no moment where they feel they can know exactly what 's coming next
zone2	aware of as a kid . When Psycho came out , it caused a buzz in the neighborhood among the parents . And I remember my mother saying : " It 's this horrible old man , he makes these horrible movies . " I just said , " Really ? " But it was a sense of the totally forbidden and somebody who 'd crossed the line . No ! So later when I saw his films ... it was kind of the delight of seeing this kind of savage wit , if you will ... that beneath , in Hitchcock 's case especially ... the very urbane , sophisticated , civilized veneer ... was this kind of feral , quick animal ... that knew exactly where the jugular was ... and kind of delighted in the taste of the blood . Hitchcock was the master of suspense . Jonathan Demme was devoted to Hitchcock ... and his influence can clearly be seen in The Silence of the Lambs . Suspense is really an expression of fear . We can build that in our storytelling by withholding information .
zone2	that manipulation , it also empowers the story . Not knowing where we 're going to go next ... is the thing that human beings hate the most . We 'd all like to know where we 're going , if it 's gon na be all right . My editing process is an intuitive process . It 's what feels truthful . It 's what feels strong and it 's what works . And you hear this from a lot of editors . Dede Allen always used to say to me , " I cut with my gut . " And she 's right . Cavalry ! Three riders ! Just over that hill ! There 's a mismatch here ... and I 'm gon na have to determine whether this is a problem or not ... because Brown is looking toward camera ... but when we cut , he 's looking up off to the left . We can have Jeremy come in and cut ... so that Jeremy 's head is masking Brown 's head ... so that the mismatch is not seen . And now I
zone2	gon na get rid of this area ... which is three frames . And now I 'm going to look at it in context and see how it looks . Three riders ! Just over that hill ! Good . You have to have the personality that enjoys that ... It 's almost like making little pieces of jewelry . That patience of the individual shots and how they 're crafted together ... but at the same time , you have to have an appreciation for the larger picture ... and how these shots fit into the larger picture of the scene ... and then how the scene fits into the larger picture of the sequence ... and how the sequence fits together with the larger picture of the whole work ... and then how the work fits together with society . So it 's boxes within boxes within boxes . In the 1930s , movies became an even bigger business . The movie studios introduced sound films ... and radically reshaped moviemaking . Hollywood retooled itself on the model of the factory assembly line . The studios cranked out
zone2	mass-produced cars . Stay where you are , all of you . " I do n't want it good , " Jack Warner declared , " I want it Tuesday . " You now needed an industrial system to make this all work . In the first 20 , 25 , 30 years of cinema ... large numbers of editors were women . It was considered to be a woman 's job ... because it was something like knitting . It was something like tapestry , sewing ... that you took these pieces of fabric , which is what films are ... and you put them together . It was when sound came in ... that the men began to infiltrate the ranks of the editors ... because sound was somehow electrical . It was technical . It was no longer knitting . There is the soundtrack , which might be several tracks ... and the image . And without the happy marriage of those two ... you 're not using every bit of potential that you possibly can in editing a movie . The scene in Horse Whisperer where
zone2	because she is gon na leave . The intent of the scene was to show that the marriage was foundering ... and it was dialogue basically overlapping as they were speaking . So they were both miked . To make it even more dramatic , I even took out more air ... and made the overlaps more intense . I could do that because I had separate tracks to work with . Are you a psychiatrist ? He says it takes time . Well , I do n't care what he says . I can not sit here and pretend everything 's gon na be all right . I am not pretending , I am trusting ... We are losing . We are losing her ! In effect , by taking out all the air in that particular dialogue scene ... it did have kind of a suffocating effect because there was no respite ... there was no air there . You could n't draw a breath . And it became that much more intense because of it . To me , sound is very important . I create a
zone2	temporary music that evokes certain feelings . I 've worked with Per Hallberg , who 's a sound designer ... and with Ridley Scott . For example , in Black Hawk Down ... the incursion of the Black Hawks entering into Mogadishu . It was almost like a ballet , a science-fiction ballet ... people landing on a different planet . I was not interested in hearing all the helicopters , only music . Showing it from a subjective point of view . So this idea of science fiction , when I was putting the scene together ... just inspired me to use almost no sound . I remember that the real Black Hawk pilots wanted to see the footage . So , one day I just showed them an assembly . They were really moved . One guy , there was a tear in his eye , and he says ... " I do n't know . This looks great . I got goose bumps . " These were the guys that were there ... and it felt real to them . There was this scene in Dante 's
zone2	a long tunnel to his truck ... and the tunnel is about to collapse . And you hear the sound , the little sound of sand ... falling down the walls . So at one point , the music editor asked me for the scene ... and she proceeded to put music on it ... and I looked at it and I said , " That does n't work at all . " Because suddenly I 'm hearing music ... and I 'm not hearing all that stuff , that tiny little sand thing ... that makes me scared . If you were in a really dangerous situation , your ears would be so open ... and hearing every little tiny , tiny sound . If it just has music smooshed over it ... you know , it takes away that sense of listening with all your might . I mean , if I were the character , I 'd say , " Turn that off ! I ca n't hear . " The advent of sound expanded the editor 's role in Hollywood . During the ' 30s and
zone2	. The editing was controlled by the studios and their supervising editors . One of the most powerful was Margaret Booth ... supervising editor at MGM for 30 years . Mastering the transition to sound ... she caught the attention of legendary producer Irving Thalberg ... who was the first to call cutters " film editors " ... starting with Booth herself . She oversaw all the production but had a say in almost every one . Maggie was probably the toughest and most feared woman at MGM . People would shudder when they 'd hear that she was on the phone ... or she 'd bust into the editing room ... or you 'd get a call , " Come down to Room F , " which is her room . You 'd think , " God , what have I done now ? " Margaret would tell the editors . ; " It 's your responsibility for the pace of the movie . " It 's your responsibility to get the best performances out of your actors . " It 's your responsibility to make it as good
zone2	to say : " If I feel there 's a cut at a certain spot ... " whether it matches or not , cut . " If you cut for the emotion ... " you will get away with so much by doing that . " And I would hear her really yell at different editors ... who would say , " It does n't match . " She 'd say , " I do n't care . Cut . " Booth , like other great studio editors of the era ... helped create many of the stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood . Editors today are still doing the same . We totally control the performance of an actor in the cutting room , actually . A lot of them wo n't admit that . Most actors learn early on that the editor is the one to make friends with ... ' cause their performance depends a great deal on the editor ... and the taste and the talent of the editor . We 'll see dailies , and Take 5 is spectacular . It is great .
zone2	and Take 4 and Take 3 . Sometimes , an actor will see it onscreen and say : " That was terrific . You used Take 5 . " They do n't know , they do n't realize ... that you are borrowing from every single performance ... and the editor is the person who is responsible ... for finding those moments in each performance . You talk about Basic Instinct , I think , to a large degree ... that the great performance that Sharon is giving there ... is also constructed ... by Frank . He spent an enormous amount of time ... in selecting every part of every take ... that he felt was important . In cutting the interrogation sequence ... using the basic scenes that were back and forth from the dialogue ... the scene would be fairly dull . I had to create her looks and his looks . They were manufactured . They were n't really shot that way . I would take a piece ... of Michael looking at her from a different part of the scene ... and a piece of
zone2	scene . I do n't make any rules , Nick . I go with the flow . Sharon asked if she could see it , and I said , " Yeah , it 's done . " And Sharon came upstairs and said , " You must remove that scene . " And I said , " What scene ? " And she says , " You know the scene . In the interrogation . " But they were all afraid , I think , that these shots would hurt her performance . And even Sharon , I think , still thinks now ... that she lost the Oscar nomination because of these shots . And I said , " Sharon , that scene is gon na make you a star . " And Paul said to her : " You shot it . You know what I was doing ... " and basically , I like it . And it works . " Then , you know , the rest is history . Most actors ' idea of a well-edited movie ... is a movie that has a lot
zone2	And that could cause me a lot of grief , but what the heck . I knew an actor who used to read a script basically this way : He would say , " Blah-blah-blah . My line . " And he 'd read it , " Blah-blah-blah . " Steven Seagal was an action hero , who , on Under Siege 2 ... I felt would break me in half . He was allowed into the cutting room to cut the action sequences . I thought that 's all he was gon na do . But his first time he came into the cutting room ... he said , " Okay , put up reel one . " He was gon na go through the whole movie . But there was a time when during one of the fight sequences ... that I found myself with my arm behind my head ... and Seagal was demonstrating on me what he did . And he 's a big guy , plus he carries a gun . I think , ultimately , he did like his performances . But the fact
zone2	an antagonistic relationship with the director ... and as editor , I was caught in the middle . I have a friend who did a picture ... where there was a comedian in the film who had final cut over only his scenes . And he had decided recently ... that he did n't want to be a knock-about comedian anymore . He wanted to be a Cary Grant-style comedian . So he came into the editing room and cut out all of the pratfalls ... and all of the physical shtick that he had done in the picture ... which obviously did n't help the movie any . I have never let an actor into the editing room to have feedback . I think , in general , this is how I feel as an actor . Even though I love the cutting room and nothing would make me happier ... than to sit there and watch them do their stuff , I feel it 's inappropriate . I feel like that 's the time for the director to have with the editor . Home for the Holidays was
zone2	... it was about a family that was a mess , about chaos and anarchy in the family . The centerpiece is this Thanksgiving dinner scene ... and everybody 's gathered around the table ... and everybody 's crazies are all over the place . Jodie Foster , of course , attracted the most wonderful bunch of actors ... who , just working with her , they left their ego on the doorstep . Nothing makes us happier ... than to walk into a scene where there 's six different actors ... they all have different styles of performance ... maybe even different pacing ... and somehow figure out a way to weave them all together . Lynzee and I will sit there and say , " What do you think she 's thinking now ? " Is she thinking , ' How do I get the hell out of here ? ' " Or , ' I really like this guy and I 'm kind of attracted to him . " ' We 'd get so into very obscure behavior . We 'd see the deep meaning the actor
zone2	they picked up their fork ... before or after the spoon was picked up . " Now what did that mean ? " And , of course , each little meaningless gesture adds up to a full performance . When I got the dailies ... I assumed that everything she shot ... were things she intended to be on the screen . And I enjoy the challenge of that , of just trying to use everything . At one point , a turkey gets pushed and splashes on someone . Every time we looked at it , we would try it a different way . Now , you can have the guy who 's doing it on his close-up ... and then have the turkey splash ... or the turkey splashes , you see the reaction shot . You can go a billion ways . Cocksucker ! One of the things that I love about Lynzee ... is that she 's one of these people ... who really sees that there is a beautiful and sunny place out there . If we could just get to it , it 's
zone2	that I will hand it over ... not only to my editor ... but , at times , to my lead actor . First of all , if you have Jack Nicholson starring in your movie ... and you call somebody , an actor , up , and say : " Would you like to spend two days working with Mr . Nicholson ... " or do you have something better to do ? " ... he usually gets a good response . When Jay and I feel that we 've really got the picture in a great place ... and it 's particularly easy now that we 're editing electronically ... where I 'll have Jack come into the editing room with Jay and I 'll check out . And he 'll bring Jack in and run the movie , even run outtakes ... and talk about if there 's a take that we did n't use . He did something interesting that he remembered , why did n't we use it ? What Nicholson did at the end ... was a Nicholsonian construct . The disjointed nature of
zone2	who 's taken the only love ... that had been possible in his life ... and squandered it for what was his own personal obsession . If you 've written it smartly , you have a smart actor playing it . And that actor , when it 's Jack Nicholson , can be very helpful in the cutting room . I find that with the actors , in most of the pictures I made ... we kind of nail it on the set , usually ... and invariably , looking at rushes , I 'll tell Thelma , " That 's the take . " Then she 'll feel a certain thing for some other takes ... and we line it up that way . Because we grew up in the cin ? ma v ? rit ? period of documentary filmmaking ... it was a marked influence on how we work . For example , I found it extremely helpful ... when Marty 's doing heavy improvisational films ... like Raging Bull or Goodfellas ... that my years of trying to carve a story ... out of a mass
zone2	improvisation ... and begin to find a way to shape it . Of course , in a film like Raging Bull ... De Niro and Joe Pesci were remarkable to watch kicking off each other . I wanted to have a very open , honest approach to the imagery and the story ... in the scenes that were not in the ring in Raging Bull ... and that came a lot from a kind of wiping away ... of all technique that I had thought about before ... and going back to a sort of an impact that I had when I was about 5 or 6 ... having seen Italian neorealist films on TV : Pais ? , Open City and The Bicycle Thief . You 're supposed to be a manager , supposed to know what you 're doing . I did what I wanted to do . - That 's what I 'm worried about , you ... - You want a title shot ? What are you talking ... What am I , in a circus over here ? I ask him , he 's got
zone2	You been killing yourself for three years now , right ? There 's nobody left for you to fight . Everybody 's afraid to fight you . Okay . Along comes this kid , Janiro . He do n't know any better . He 's a young kid , up and coming . He 'll fight anybody . Good . You fight him . Bust his hole . Tear him apart . Right ? What 's the biggest thing you got to worry about , your weight ? - I 'm worried about the weight . - The weight ? What 're we arguing for ? I just said the weight . That was one of the hardest things I 've ever had to do ... because I only had one camera on the actor at all times . So I did n't have the response , the immediate response of the actor ... so it meant that I had to put it together like a jigsaw puzzle . It was a lot of fun , but it took a long time . Ultimately , what I think I need
zone2	of the picture ... keeping track , emotionally , of the characters . This is the key for me . I always find the editor has more objectivity than the director . ' Cause the editor was n't on the set . The editor did n't cast the movie . The editor did n't do the storyboards . The editor did n't inundate him or herself ... with a year and a half of pre-production . So the editor has the most objective eye ... in that creative environment . I remember one night , I go over to Steven 's house in Poland . I said , " Steve , I want to run this scene for you . " And he says : " Okay , " and I run the scene . He looks at me . He says , " I 'll see you in the morning . " He walked out . He was so emotionally involved with the scene ... he could n't believe that he shot it , it was so real . We were all terribly affected by the film . There
zone2	very emotional , when there are problems in people 's lives . Something emotional takes over that 's beyond your conscious mind . It seemed like an extreme example , but when you 're editing that kind of film ... you have to disassociate . You have to see each thing as a scene and you build a scene and do the best ... you can with each scene . When it melds together that 's when you get the full force . I think this scene in Schindler 's List really illustrates the importance of ... emotion through film editing . It 's the scene where they have a drink together ... the first drink they 've shared because Stern has refused to drink with ... Schindler until this moment . There is just a pacing that is so ... emotional for me . So profoundly , deeply felt . Someday ... this is all going to end , you know . I was going to say , we 'll have a drink then . I think I 'd better have it now . Mike Kahn 's choices of
zone2	and ... study each other , and think about how they 're feeling , that was all done in ... the editing room . It was n't in the script and it was n't on the floor the day I shot it . That whole emotional , kind of , meeting of the minds ... between those two great men happened in the editing room . In dialogue scenes , I like people looking at each other . I like eyes to meet . And so they 're getting into each other and you 're connecting . For me , I 'm always having problems ... cutting long scenes where people talk to each other . ' Cause you 've got ... an unlimited amount of choices and opportunities ... when you just have two talking heads . The scene can go many different ways . The drama could become comedy . Pathos could become tragedy . It could become , you know , kind of like ... a grilling session or a deposition ... if you cut it really fast , or it can be very leisurely and introspective
zone2	lot of the breaths and air and the pauses ... not just the words . And that 's where a great film editor can help a director . Another way of looking at film editing is that it 's a dance of eyes . Philip Seymour Hoffman 's eye is looking . That 's a good thing . Now , let 's cut to a close-up of Hoffman looking ... and the close-up of Hoffman is here . We 've never seen this angle before , so ... the brain has to figure out what it 's looking at and maybe why it 's looking ... at it . And to the degree that ... you hold shots ... a certain length , you allow a certain train of thoughts to happen . When you cut a shot off ... you 've also cut off the thinking about that shot . Now , we want to cut to what he sees because that 's how we 're going to ... understand what he 's thinking about . Now there you see him thinking and ... then his eye goes down
zone2	. Point of view . Thinking . Other co-conspirator . " Let 's do it , now . " " What ? " " Let 's go . Oops , something 's up . Do n't do it . " And we go . There 's something about film , because of its sensory completeness ... the fact that it is sound and image ... in this powerful fusion ... that gets at something very deep within us . Filmmakers realized that sound and image did n't just stimulate emotions . They could also influence beliefs . During WWll , the U.S . Government enlisted Hollywood 's best . Editors and directors brought with them the same techniques they had used ... in fiction films to stir audiences across America . I pledge allegiance to the flag ... of the United States of America . The Hollywood recruits applied their skill to American propaganda films ... such as Why We Fight . Both German and American political leaders ... recognized how powerfully sound and picture can manipulate audiences . One of the most infamous examples of film used for political
zone2	Riefenstahl ... used sound , music , and masterful editing ... to make Adolf Hitler into a god . When the Allies went to war against Germany , British editor Charles Ridley ... re-edited the same footage to turn Hitler into a fool . Whether used for propaganda or entertainment ... these techniques showed how powerfully editing could shape hearts and minds . I 'd seen the German propaganda in Holland when we were occupied . The methodology of the whole thing is , of course , to show ... only one side of reality . Young people from all over the globe are joining up to fight for the future . I 'm doing my part . I 'm doing my part . I 'm doing my part . I 'm doing my part , too . You know , Starship Troopers is , style-wise , as a movie ... has been influenced consciously by ... Why We Fight in WWII ... Triumph of the Will . I used the Leni Riefenstahl touch ... just to tell the audience this group of people is not aware of the fact
zone2	give their lives for goals that are ... only interesting to the government . Fresh meat for the grinder ? So , how 'd you kids do ? I 'm going to be a pilot . Well , good for you . We need all the pilots we can get . I think the theme of the movie is : " Come on , it 's great . Let 's go to war and die . " What about you , son ? Infantry , sir . Good for you . Mobile infantry made me the man I am today . In editing , you can do the same trick . It 's all trying to sell us something . Manipulation that 's done by editing ... manipulation done by the glamorous photography ... and by a certain kind of music that makes you think ... that you are going to Heaven or whatever . The manipulation of the elements within a film is a very powerful thing . It 's almost a sacred thing , in a way , because you 're creating effects ... you 're creating responses
zone2	manipulating reality ... as the audience sees it , ' cause you want the audience to respond in a certain way . Whether it 's a laugh or a sigh ... or a fright ... everything 's manipulated . Some people say , " This director , he 's manipulated the audience . " Well , that 's so naive because that 's all we do , is manipulate . After WWll , Hollywood continued to make movies the same way it had ... before the war . Although editors were now unionized ... they were viewed , for the most part , as highly skilled mechanics . There was a man named Owen Marks ... he edited The Petrified Forest , Casablanca ... The Treasure of the Sierra Madre , East Of Eden . His films are immortal and the man is completely unknown . It 's sort of symbolic of the way ... editors have been ignored ... in the ... literature about Hollywood . Editors worked on Cutter 's Row ... and were expected to conform to the established rules of editing . If we were to
zone2	was a certain film language that was very distinct . Certain kinds of coverage . Long shot . Two-shot . Single , single . There was almost a formulaic way of presenting films . This film language was very strict . And in editorial terms , there were rules ... that one felt could not be broken . A master shot had to come first and then if you had an over-shoulder ... you went to the over-shoulder . You never went to the close-up ... till you 'd done the whole dance , coming from far to close . For instance , if you were going to have a transition from one place to the next ... it would be done with a dissolve . The next thing you 've got to remember is that a gentleman you meet among ... the cold cuts is simply not as attractive as one you meet ... in the mink department at Bergdorf 's . In the ' 40s and ' 50s , the audience would expect a character to drive up ... you 'd show him getting out of the car
zone2	he would open the door and then the editor would match cut ... the door opening on the other side . And he would walk in ... and come over and sit down . - Pull up a chair . - Thanks . This seemed to me absolutely stupid that you had to show somebody coming ... down the stairs and all the way across the road and up the other side . You knew that they were coming from here and they were going to there . Why could n't you just cut directly ? In France , a group of film-critics- turned-directors also challenged ... the doctrine of invisible editing and launched a revolution among editors . When I first saw the French Nouvelle Vague , I instantly loved it . I loved the idea . I loved the way they edited ... and thought I would like to cut like that . Godard used jump cuts because it was like , " Why not ? " Nothing interesting 's happening in the middle part so let 's go to a jump cut . " When I saw
zone2	What they brought to editing was a breaking of the rules . Whatever books that said , " This is how it had to be done , " they burned them . Breathless is too hip for me . I come from the Lower East Side . I 'm an Italian-American guy . It was , it 's too beat , beatnik . It 's like , bohemian . It 's too cool . I liked it . I did n't know what the hell was happening in it . You know , when I first saw Breathless in the ' 60s ... it 's like , wow . I mean , just in the first five-minute sequence in introducing ... Jean-Paul Belmondo 's character as this petty thief ... every rule was violated in terms of how long to hold the shots ... the discontinuity of what was going on . Even screen directions were mixed . And I thought , " Either this guy does n't know what he 's doing or he 's ... " so confident that he has the grammar of film down , that
zone2	way to use the material he has to tell the story . " There were some films that really changed our perception ... of what ... filmmaking was and certainly it affected what editing was . I think one of those seminal films is certainly something like Bonnie and Clyde . Some people say I broke those rules first . I certainly did not . I mean , the Russians broke those rules ... and the Germans broke those rules . This was nothing new . But it was new for Hollywood . Several editors have had big impacts on me , have ... influenced my thinking . Dede Allen certainly is one who has taught me that . ; " Do n't be afraid to ... " take a chance on doing something that does n't seem like it 's going to work . " When Beatty and Faye Dunaway get to know each other , they 're standing ... on a street corner and she says , " I do n't believe you rob banks . " And he said , " Yes , I do , look
zone2	and holds it to her on the street corner . And that could easily have been done with the tilt down to the gun , the pan ... over to her hands fidgeting with the Coke bottle , up to her face ... but it was done in , her eyes look from him ... down , gun , back to him . It keeps you on edge . There is the excitement . There is the danger . There is the eroticism in not being ... able to fully get every moment because you 're cutting it off . And you are not allowing the moment to come to fruition . Bonnie and Clyde was much more violent than anything we 'd done because ... the Americans like violence much more than we do . Well , it was shot in so many wonderful ways because this is the scene that ... Arthur intended to be ... cut in this fashion . The fact that it was so beautifully executed ... right from the very first cut . Jerry Greenberg was my assistant . And on the last scene
zone2	did all ... the primary editing on that . All I did was tighten it later . Again , one is not saying that this was the beginning of the American New Wave ... because one is sure that there were smaller films before that . But this was the one that , like Birth of a Nation ... which suddenly an audience sort of said , " Wow . " Bonnie and Clyde paved the way for films like Easy Rider . So I had only had one feature under my belt . We started on Easy Rider . I was editing while they were traveling . Footage was flowing in by the mile . It was great , exciting . It was different than anything I 'd been involved in . You asshole . These transitions that everybody remembers , going from one scene ... to the next , where it flashes forward to the scene , flashes back ... to the scene you 're in . Dennis did n't want a straight cut . I did n't want dissolves . So we kept throwing that around .
zone2	which was , " What if we ... " went and then came back ? " And I said , " Yeah , but let 's do it ... " three times . " Then we finally arrived at the length . Each one is six frames . I said , " Now we can use these whenever we want to . " Well , as it turned out , it started to become a device . So we stopped doing that . I said , " No , we are n't going to do that . " We 'll only use it in special places . " Without giving anything away ... everybody was stoned when they were shooting . I learned soon on that I could not be stoned and edit . While it was going on , I thought it was grand . Then I 'd look at it when I was straight and I 'd say , " This is awful . " I got ta throw it out and start all over . " This film has become an icon . I 'm grateful that
zone2	had grown up in the ' 30s , ' 40s , and ' 50s ... with movies as they were then . And finally , we were going to run it for Columbia ... with Leo Jaffe , Chairman of the Board . It ended . There was this long pause . Leo finally stands up . Then he says : " I do n't know what the fuck this picture means . " But I know we 're going to make a fuck of a lot of money . " One of the things you have to develop as an editor ... is a very strong intuition about ... where is their attention . And ... under most ordinary circumstances ... you 're carrying that attention around ... without doing violence to it . It 's like a cup full of liquid that you 're carrying . " I do n't want to spill anything . " And as a result , people feel the invisibility of what you 're doing . I often forget that what he actually does ... is assemble the film in a technical way
zone2	Why are n't we caring as much ... " about this character now as we were two scenes ago ? " Why have we lost the thread of that character 's development ? " Why does it feel like the end decelerates ... " when , in fact , the cutting rhythm is faster ? " But a lot of what a director does ... is what the immune system of the organism does ... which is to say , " Yes , that 's good . " I will allow this to come into the body . " Or , " No , that 's a different blood type . " I do n't want that to come in . " Walter 's theories ? I 'd say , every day Walter shares a theory with me . So they 're going up , trying to get away from him before he catches them . Then the cavalry come around the corner . And Veasey , the Philip Seymour Hoffman character ... realizes that his only chance now is to yell ... and maybe the Northerners will shoot the
zone2	. Shoots one of the other guys . And they all roll down the hill . Then Brown gets shot . And the last image is of Inman , our hero ... in this pile of bodies . We do n't know whether he 's dead or what . Sex scenes , in general , I think , are probably difficult for everyone . Difficult for writers , difficult for actors , difficult for directors . It 's the most intimate sort of moments that humans can have together ... and you 're saying , " Actually , let 's put it on a 40-foot screen ... " for a few thousand people . " One of the things I wanted to do with Body Heat was make a very sexy movie . There had been a whole liberation in American movies in the ' 60s and ' 70s ... about what you could show . But as that freedom took over ... it seemed to me that the movies had become less erotic . They had become more explicit . Larry really wanted me to bring a woman 's
zone2	as implicit as possible as opposed to explicit . After all , eroticism is born out of what you can imagine ... as opposed to what you actually see . That 's the difference between eroticism and pornography . You need , not just this incredible technician ... this artist , but you need a psychologist . Someone who can handle you . Because a director , in the quiet confines of that room ... is like a caged animal . In that particular scene ... we had more footage that was more explicit ... and there was simply an editorial choice not to show it . The erotic landscape in films , the sexual landscape ... is often the hardest to do because everybody has an opinion . And everybody has a point of view about what 's sexy and what 's erotic . And it 's an odd place to go to , as a filmmaker ... partly because it 's been trespassed into so many times by so many other movies . I think it 's very erotic when you do n't see that much . It
zone2	way it was written was just one scene in the bar . So I cut the scene where they meet ... and he sits down and talks to her and they start flirting . And then the scene in the bedroom was only shot silently ... because it was going to have the dialogue from the first scene laid over it anyway . So it did n't work as a scene . Then we got the idea , Steven Soderbergh and I , sort of between us ... to start intercutting . We just tried one or two things and it started to gel . Flashing back , sometimes we flash forward . I would say , " Let 's do this and cut from here and the hands . " And he 'd say : " Let 's try overlaying the dialogue here . " We just did it together . It was really exciting . We did this little thing of stopping the frames . It 's never really a long freeze . It 's just a few frames that we freeze . Just heighten the sexual tension
zone2	. It 's very emotional . It 's very sexual , I think , without really showing much . Some other films I 've done have shown more . . - You went to see her ? - To warn her about Chino . - So she did help you ? - We should n't get into that . You know , when they 're undressing separately ... and we 've got odd dialogue over the undressing . Nothing to do with what they 're actually doing . Yet , I think ... that it 's really good and very good storytelling . This kind of cutting in Out of Sight and in movies like JFK ... represents a further break from Griffith 's classic style of seamless editing . You got ta start thinking on a different level , like the CIA does . Where editors once labored to preserve the illusion of continuous time and space ... they now fracture it at will , creating new possibilities for storytelling . ... exactly what he said he was . A patsy . Oliver Stone is a very wonderful director
zone2	rein . He says to the editor , " Play jazz . " Just go free form . " There is a scene in JFK where ... Oswald walks from a house to a theater ... and he said , " When you cut this scene just make it very chaotic . " So I cut the scene in what I thought was a chaotic way ... and I showed him the next day and he said " No , no , no . " It 's got ta be way more chaotic than that . " Since we cut JFK on a three-quarter inch linear editing system ... one thing it had was the ability to hit these buttons ... and change where the edit went . So I sat there and just banged on the keys like this ... and I showed it to him the next day and he went , " That 's it ! " It 's in the movie . In xXx , I did have a new editing philosophy . I had been interested in Cubism all my life . And one day
zone2	some amazing stunt . They 'll do it in reverse and do it forward and then they 'll do it in reverse . I suddenly thought , " What if I did it in so many angles ... " that I did n't care whether you saw the beginning of a stunt ... " from four different angles ? " And the way we would cut it you would feel ... that you were going around the event in pieces ... so that by the time that motorcycle lands ... you 've actually experienced the jump ... almost as if you 're on the motorcycle ... as opposed to standing back at a safe distance ... observing the event like you would in real life . This is not real life . This is really relishing ... this action moment ... by making a Cubist editing approach . Another change in editing is the accelerated pace of movies ... a subject of controversy among filmmakers . An encounter with two swords 30 years ago ... would have been probably done in a master shot and a couple of exchanges .
zone2	eye blink . A blade going into a chest . Slight movement of a wrist . So the audience is taken right down ... into this roller-coaster ride of minutiae . And that 's what they want . Because kids today are raised on television and then MTV ... and commercials ... they not only can process information faster ... and understand what images mean , but that they demand it . I think the MTV generation in the ' 80s kind of ... created this style of editing . And Billy Weber and I on Top Gun , we were pushed in that direction . Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson were very much in tune with their audiences . They felt that that was what the audiences liked . And I think they were proven right ... given the box-office on some of those early movies . And I mean fast cutting was not invented now or with MTV . Just look at Lou Lombardo 's work on The Wild Bunch . Sometimes a cutting style is effective inside of a movie ... to shake you up and rattle
zone2	pounding away at you like a metronome on high speed for two and a half hours ... is a little bit , at least for me , maybe I 'm just getting old ... but it 's a little bit debilitating . Now , it does n't bother my kids . Because my kids were raised on 30-second commercials and on MTV ... and VH1 and they were raised on video games . I feel like I was born 80 and I 'm growing backwards . So now I 'm somewhere around 27 . You know , I get a tattoo ... and I 'm feeling closer to a generation that has ... learned to absorb information at a speed that was ... heretofore unthinkable ... and where their rhythms are well ... more hungry than a traditional narrative pace . What I 'm afraid of is the tendency for everything to go by quickly . And I 'm afraid of what it does to the culture . A sense of consuming something and throwing it away ... as opposed to being enveloped with something . Of taking the time
zone2	First , one understands ... that he causes much of his own suffering needlessly . Second , he looks for the reasons for this in his own life . To look is to have confidence in one 's own ability to end the suffering . Finally , a wish arises to find the path to peace . For all beings desire happiness . All wish to find their purer selves . Many times editing is about when not to cut . When to have the silence . When to let the moment be itself . The musicality of Places in the Heart , is one of the things that is the strongest . And I do n't mean the score . I mean the musicality in the way that the scenes flow together ... the ambience of that rural Texas summer ... hot , with the cicadas ... and there 's a Foursquare Protestant feeling . After her husband has been shot by this drunk black kid on the railroad tracks ... there were no funeral parlors , you could n't afford one anyway ... in the Depression ... the
zone2	on the dining room table ... where they just had Sunday dinner . An incredibly moving moment . And we just held on her . We would have been married 15 years this October . We had two children ... and I never knew till just now Royce had a scar right there . And it was just exquisite , moving , beautiful . If we had cut it , it would have destroyed everything . Editing is like poetry . It has to do with rhythms , with visual ... It 's visual poetry . The digital revolution has further enhanced the poetic powers of the editor . George Lucas , who began his career as an editor ... is one of the pioneers of this new technology . All art is technology . That 's the very nature of it . The artist is always bumping against that technology . And the advent of whether it 's a new color of blue ... whether it 's a proscenium arch , whatever it is ... it changes the way we work in that art form . With computer technology
zone2	adding or removing elements from the original image . This increases the editor 's control ... but also multiplies the number of decisions to be made . Now you can edit in what I call 3D . Which is , you have a scene ... and you have people in the scene and you can cut those people out ... you can move them around in the scene . You can go in for a close-up , go out . You can sort of direct the film in the editing room ... which is , growing up as an editor , what I 've always wanted to do . The new technology also makes it possible ... to cut the movie before shooting begins . Pre-visualization gives an editor much more input in planning the movie . I have a system now , because of the digital world , I have a group of kids ... who do little videomatics of things . We have a little blue screen . We can send these editors in and shoot scenes ... on just an amateur video camera . So I can
zone2	the film ... right there in the editing room . Every main character in our movie has a digital counterpart . We have totally virtual actors now and we use them quite a bit . Mostly we use them for stunts and things . We have a lot of situations where it 's better to use a digital actor ... than it is to use a real actor . Christopher Lee is 80 years old . He ca n't really fight the way he did in Attack of the Clones . You 're not gon na get an artificial-intelligence computer ... that 's neurotic enough to be able ... to understand how you create a performance . Performance is an art . At the end of the day , all this stuff has to work ... to tell a story . And if you 're not telling a story ... it does n't matter how much razzle-dazzle there is . It 's not about the tools , it 's about the story . In many ways , we 're the last storyteller . The movie 's been written by the
zone2	comes to the last storytelling which is in the editing process . The last draft of the screenplay is the first cut of the movie . And the final cut of the movie ... is the last draft of the script . An editor can take a sequence that a director has shot ... and reconfigure it so that it becomes a whole different sequence ... which is much more beneficial to the movie . Bob Fosse referred to me as a collaborator ... on his movies and I do n't think there can be a greater compliment for an editor ... to be called a collaborator , to really ... have that function . And now a word about dykes . Pow . I like dykes . How could you say that ? Lenny was a biographical film of the comedian Lenny Bruce ... who was often arrested for taking language ... to the legal limits of where it could go in the late ' 50s . The most wonderful thing that happened in it ... was near the end of the production . We had to show the
zone2	film was the best script I ever read . But we were having a problem . We hated the ending . You 're trying to stop the information . Bailiff , will you please remove this man from the courtroom ? It was just not coming together . When Lenny is dragged out of the courtroom ... his life is effectively over . Between that period and the time of his death ... there were 20 minutes of material . And I turned to Bob and I said : " Why do n't we just kill the son of a bitch ? " I took out two reels of film ... and I went straight from " You ca n't stop the information " ... to Lenny 's body on the floor . And that was the most exciting thing I 've ever done in a cutting room . I mean , we just loved that . The opening scene of Apocalypse is a good example ... of what you can achieve editorially ... that is not based on the original script . There were some collisions of images that
zone2	... that were at variance with how he had planned to begin the film originally . The trees being napalmed was originally shot for the surfing scene ... which comes much later in the film . There was a shot of jungle ... bursting into slow-motion flames with helicopters flying ... at odd angles in slow motion through the frame . And when Francis saw that shot in dailies , which was , I think , simply done ... to record this explosion . It was n't intended to use it in the finished film . But he looked at it and said , " That 's the film right there . " Jungle , flames , helicopters . " The Martin Sheen character was one that was shaped ... very significantly in the editing room . The film itself was shot ... with the idea that there would be a narrative glue to hold the film together . What exactly that glue was ... and who the character of the narrator really was ... was really not shaped until well into the post-production process . Willard punches the mirror
zone2	this is really happening . That 's real blood . That 's Marty Sheen . None of that was intended to happen . That was just Francis saying . ; " Marty , let 's shoot an improvisation with you trapped in your room ... " and what is gon na happen . " I think as we worked on the film , we realized ... that the film itself was , in its own strange way , a kind of modern opera . And the reality of dealing ... just in the beginning , with the Martin Sheen character ... was not sufficient to give the audience ... not only the emotional state with which to enter the film ... but the visual iconography of the film itself . Going through the dailies of the film , I collected a number of images ... of the Cambodian heads , burning images from the end ... and worked them in through a series of multilevel dissolves ... with the burning napalm and the helicopters flying through ... and then images of Willard 's room and Willard asleep ... and he
zone2	helicopter sounds ... and now you see this ceiling fan ... and what you 're hearing is the sound of a helicopter . Is that coming from his dream ? Is it a reality ? Is somehow that sound coming from the fan ? I remember when I was assembling those images ... almost jumping away from the editing machine when I put that sound ... with that image ... because it seemed to me that that fan was making that sound ... even though I knew it was impossible and if it convinced me , who was doing it ... it surely would convince others . Now they begin to coalesce and they turn into a real helicopter . Coming from a fan ? No . And then you hear a real helicopter fly over the room . Willard gets up out of bed , goes over to the window and says . ; Saigon . Shit . All of that , the narration , and the helicopter flying over ... and the napalm jungle ... is concocted into something ... that is a powerful beginning to a film
zone2	powerful in the way that it sets the stage ... for the journey that this particular film is going to take . Obviously , great directors give you great material to work with . But the ultimate film that you see is the edited version ... and the editor is greatly responsible for that . I find my work absolutely fascinating and absorbing . I sat down to work and 30 years went by ... without my noticing it . It 's true . When I go into an editing room in the morning ... I edit . My assistant has to remind me it 's lunchtime . Or Steven has to come in and say , " Hey , Mike , why do n't you stop for a while ? " Because time goes by like that . You 're building a whole other world . You 're building a whole construct . There 's a joy on one level in that it 's like putting a puzzle together . " I have thousands of pieces and how do I tell the story ? " And this goes before
zone2	, I only need half of that . " The job is not unlike the Talmudic scholar ... who goes and sits and argues about the book ... over and over again , always coming up with new answers ... that are just more subtly refined than the last answer . To sit in a theater at a preview and to hear an audience laugh ... at that moment when you expect the laugh and it comes back at you ... or to hear an audience shuffling and crying because ... it 's so sad and you expect that moment to really happen that way ... that 's so marvelous . It tells you what power we have . I believe in people being able to learn because otherwise , what 's the point ? We 're all gon na , you know , be passed one of these days ... and how are we gon na take this fantastic thing called film ... and motion pictures and storytelling ... unless we pass it on and teach people how to do it ? In the century since Edwin Porter introduced
zone2	rooms . Once anonymous men and women ... they have gradually become principal collaborators in the filmmaking process . The best-kept secret in the movies , the editor , is finally out . The Oscar goes to ... Thank you . Thank you so much . You know , Steven gave me ... my first editorial advice . I do n't know if you remember this or not , Steven ... but Steven produced I Wan na Hold Your Hand , my first movie . I talked to him about a lot of things but when it came to editing he said : " Hey , Bob , real easy . When in doubt , cut it out . " And ... I 've been saying that in the editing room , as you guys know ... for all these years . Steven also was able to ... When I was making that movie ... Steven had just bought his first mansion in Beverly Hills . And ... he said , " Hey , I 've got this great pool house . " You guys do n't have to edit
zone2	in the editing rooms . You guys can edit in this pool house . " And we said , " Hey , that 's great . " We went in the back of Steven 's house and edited I Wan na Hold Your Hand ... in the pool house . But this strange thing kept happening . We 'd get there in the morning and the editors would pull the reels ... off the racks and all the sprockets would be torn up ... and there 'd be , like , ripped film . And of course you do n't have to , you know ... think very far to figure out what was really happening . So I asked ... Steven about it one day and he said , " Sometimes I ca n't sleep ... " and so I thought I 'd go up to the pool house and run a few reels . " But what happens in that editing room ? You sit around , you talk about girls . And you talk dirty . And you lie on the couch . And you enjoy yourself

zone2	3151568 - I 'll miss you . - Yeah ? Of course . I wish I could go with . It 's okay . - Peek-a-boo . - Peek-a-boo . Hey . Ernst ! - Gavin ? - Yeah , in the flesh , mate . Nice to finally meet you . You all set then ? Ready to go ? - Ja . - It 's over here . Gavin , I want to thank you for looking after Martijn while he 's away . No trouble . I 'm just a glorified tour guide , really . Yeah , but he could n't do it without you . Oh , his food programme ? I 'm a bit clueless about that , I 'm afraid . It 's for the malnourished kids in the Rif Mountains . The Rif Mountains , right . Get him in , get him out , that 's my bit . Gavin , can you give me a second ? - Oh , yeah , okay . Bye-bye . - Bye . - I 'm really gon na miss you . - I 'm gon na miss you , too . It 's
zone2	n't it ? Ja , she ca n't leave the country at the moment , but hopefully she 'll get her passport in time for my next trip . I did n't know there was such a famine in Morocco . They 're malnourished , not starving . So you really do go for all this " save the children " bollocks , then ? Of course . What did you think ? I do n't know . Might 've been for Saadia 's benefit , might n't it ? Hello . - Here you are . - Thank you . You know , when I leave home , my missus wo n't even stand on the porch , let alone the observation deck at Heathrow . - You 're married ? - Why do you think I do all this travelling ? Come on . You all right ? Rif Mountains . I 'll check this bus . He 's got it , okay ? Hey ! Hey ! What 's going on ? What 's all the fuss ? Get your fucking hands off me ! Marhaba .
zone2	here . Hassan Fikri ? I 'm trying to reach Hassan Fikri . There is no Hassan Fikri here . Martijn , is that you ? Martijn ! Martijn , it 's me ! It 's me , Gavin . - Gavin ? - Yeah . What happened ? Last thing I remember was on the bus . Hey , when did they come onboard ? - Who ? - The blokes who jumped us . I do n't know . Yeah , well , do n't worry , mate . I 'm right behind you . I 've got your back , you 've got mine . Right ? Where are we ? I 'm wearing a blindfold , for fuck 's sake . Yes , but on the bus , did you recognise anything ? Oh . I was getting a bit of kip , actually . But why did they take us ? Maybe they thought we were Americans . Why would they think that ? Maybe they heard us speaking English . But I 'm from Holland . They do n't know the difference . So
zone2	and me , both . Maybe we should ask them . - What 's that ? - I do n't know . Hello ? - Is somebody else here ? - Hello ? Hello ? - Is someone else here ? - Hello ? Hello ! Just relax , will you ? They 'll let us go as soon as they realise they 've made a mistake . It is a mistake , right , Gavin ? These things usually get sorted in the first 24 hours . - This has happened to you before ? - Sure it has . - Really ? - Well , not quite like this . Then like what ? You know , seminars . - Seminars ? - Security seminars . You know , with the experts . So you 've never actually been held hostage ? No . But the company I used to work for , they had ops in lots of dodgy places . So they made us role-play this type of thing . When you were here before , what were you busy with ? Business . Yes ,
zone2	chemical company . Oh , shit ! Here , those gits made a lot of dosh off the deal . Which gits ? Those Moroccan geezers . Fuck me , if I ca n't even remember their bloody names . It looks like they remember yours . Easy with the blame game , all right ? All right , mate ? Just how many villages did your company rape and pillage ? You just shut the fuck up . We did not rape anyone . They were all proper business transactions . Then why , Gavin , would they kidnap us ? For the publicity . - Publicity ? - Yeah . Yeah , you 'll see . Pretty soon they 'll be parading us in front of the cameras trying to get us to make speeches denouncing the West , or some sort of bollocks . But I 'll tell you , mate , I 'm not gon na say a bloody word . No , I 'm not gon na give them the satisfaction . Maybe we should try and talk with them or something like that .
zone2	're not savages . - Sure they are . Stupid wankers . Listen , you 've got to drop all this PC bullshit and steel yourself , mate . - Fuck them ! Treat them like animals . - They 're not animals . The thing is do n't let them fuck with you psychologically . As soon as you realise that they do n't really have the guts to kill you , it 's easy . Well , yeah , they 'll threaten us , they 'll act like they want to kill us , but really they want to keep us alive . Really , it 's just a bluff because we 're worth nothing to them dead . Gavin , what if these guys do n't want a ransom ? - What else could they want ? - I do n't know . Shit ! Someone 's there . He 's been watching us this whole time . Hello ? Sir , you have the wrong guys . Yeah , we 're not American . - I did n't even vote for Tony Blair ! - And
zone2	go and we 'll forget the whole thing . We have n't even seen your faces ! Hello ? Hello ? Hello ! Whatever it is you want from us , you can forget about it , you understand ? You have made a massive mistake . I do n't think yelling at them is such a good idea . Fuck them ! They would n't dare kill us , not if they want sympathy . What if they do n't want sympathy ? What else could they want ? It 's a publicity stunt , is n't it ? For Christ sakes . Our photos are plastered all over every paper in Europe right now . What if they are n't ? Should we ... We should , Gavin , try and start a dialogue . No , they 're fucking fanatics . I do n't know why you even agreed to come here in the first place . To help the people , to make a difference . Oh , well , congratulations . Oh , true idealist , you are . Maybe you and old Omar over
zone2	we do . Maybe this is all one big misunderstanding . Jesus ! What 's happening ? What 's happening ? Hey , hey , here ! Hey , do n't go soft on me now , mate . You just remember what I told you , remember my advice . Fuck them , goddamn savages ! They 're just bluffing , they are . Yeah , just bluffing . - They do n't really have the balls to hurt us ! - Shut up , Gavin . They can go fuck themselves ! Now do n't go mental on me now . Remember what I told you , hold your nerve . Please , let me explain . I 've got you . You really know your way around here . I take my youth group to the beach every weekend . - You should join us sometime . - You 're right . I should do more . Yeah , you should . I have been spending all my time on the food programme . It 's going to change the world . I would like that .
zone2	. We play another game . I ... I ca n't . It is not a request . And I give to you the first move . I 'm tired . I ca n't ... I ca n't play . Voila ! If you do n't move soon , you will lose . Smart move . Choosing to play , I mean . Not your pawn . Are Muslims allowed to smoke ? I thought you said you are not American . I 'm not . - Spent time in California ? - No . - Would you like one , then ? - I do n't smoke . Afraid it 's going to ruin your health ? Why is that funny ? Nothing . Just you . Worried about your health . There are other things that you should be worried about , Martijn . Like making your next move . I have to tell you it is a pleasure to play with you , Martijn . Most Westerners can not play chess to save their own lives . I have a theory about that . Westerners can not
zone2	do you think ? I do n't gamble . If more Westerners played chess , they would understand . There are no bluffs , only calculations . I think Gavin played poker . Do n't know . Maybe . I thought you were good friends . I barely knew him . How were you introduced ? Me and Gavin ? - On the Internet . - Not by the woman ? What woman ? The Moroccan woman at Schiphol . She 's my girlfriend . So you are not married yet ? No , not yet . But you are thinking about it . - When the time is right . - Yes , yes , of course . Life can be short . Twenty-five seconds . Fifteen . - Ten . - Do you mind ? I ... Forgive me , Martijn . I only want to help . You are running out of time . I wonder , perhaps you do not like women ? What ? Perhaps you are preferring boys . No . Definitely not . - You live in Amsterdam . - Not anymore .
zone2	this ? - To visit my friends . - Friends . Gay friends ? - Not everyone in Amsterdam is gay . Then who do you visit there ? Just because I go to Amsterdam does n't mean I 'm gay . It 's like saying every Muslim is a terrorist . - Is every Muslim a terrorist ? - No . Are you ? What do you think ? You could be gay . What makes you say that ? I saw Lawrence of Arabia . And using your logic ... I could be just like one of the Muslims in that film . Yes . And look what they did to Lawrence . - What did they do to him ? - They fucked him , to humiliate him . You think I want to fuck you , Martijn ? I hope not . I could do it . Right here . In front of the camera . Would you like that ? Your move . You know , Martijn , you speak very good English . I 'm Dutch . We all speak good English . Yes
zone2	is yours . Thank you . I studied in Nigeria . So you 're not Moroccan . Tell me about your friends in America . I do n't have any friends in America . Yes , yes , but you speak their language perfectly . I used to have some clients there . - Tell me about that . - There 's nothing to tell . - You are hiding something . - No . I 'm not . You are lying . Get out of my face ! I 'm not lying . We shall see . Check . - Ca n't we ... Ca n't we take a break ? - There are no breaks . Then ca n't we quit ? You are willing to concede defeat ? No . - Then we must continue until you lose or ... - Or what ? - You know what . - No , I do n't . You will tell me when you are ready . - What will I tell you ? - Eight seconds , Martijn . - Help me a little . - Six .
zone2	- Four . - Please . - Two . You 've got to tell me . Martijn , your flag has fallen . - I should not allow that . - What do you want me to tell you ? Technically speaking , it is cheating . The game should be over . I just need to hear it from you . What is so important that you would cheat , eh ? We were talking . We were talking . What 's the matter ? You sound upset . Relax . Relax , Martijn . It 's all right . Let me see your hand . - You are a dentist ? - No . - A doctor ? - No . - A writer ? - No ! No , wait . A musician ? - No . - You are lying . I 'm not . I 'm not lying . Martijn , you have to understand , I hate it when people lie to me . I have enormous respect for artists . - Why is that ? - You play guitar ? No , wait
zone2	or classical ? - Mostly jazz . - There you are . Straight ahead or fusion ? Free jazz . - You a fan ? - In a way , yes . What way ? Jazz is American . But it has its roots here , in Africa . Where exactly in Africa are you from ? I thought you were a banker . That 's my job , not my passion . I thought the Moroccan woman was your passion . She knows how important my music is to me . And now , Martijn , so do I . Then you do n't mind if we quit ? If we do something else . Of course I mind , very much . - Please . - You know you are a very deep man , Martijn . First I discover your skill at chess , which certainly surprised me . I had no intention of playing this long . And now I learn you are a jazz pianist . It makes me wonder , when did you have the time ? - For what ? - You know
zone2	n't know ! Check . Your move again . Just say it and I will confirm it . I will tell you whatever you want . Quite obviously you will not . Just tell me who you are . I am a savage . I am an animal . Please . I ca n't tell you anything unless I know what you want me to say ! Everything . I want you to tell me everything . - You want to know my birthday ? - April 5 . My passport number ? C4538H49 . My bank account numbers ? 1 79654384H . - Then you know everything . - Not everything . There 's nothing left I can say . - You and I both know that is a lie . - I am not lying ! I am not ! - Why have you come here ? - To set up my food programme . Did Saadia put you up to this ? She ... She ... She has nothing to do with this . - I find that hard to believe . - It 's true .
zone2	truth ? Why do n't you tell me the truth ? Just who the hell you are and what the fuck do you want from me ? This is your last chance . There 's nothing else I can say . All right . - Mate . - No . I am so sorry , Martijn . - Please , another game . - I thought you were tired . - Just ... Just one more try . - The game is over . I need another chance . I need another chance ! You should have concentrated more . Your last moves were very hasty . Please . Please . Please . Another game , please . - Give me your hand . - No ! No ! No ! No ! Give me your hand , Martijn . No ! Please , no . No ! No , do n't , please ! This is your last chance . I do n't know what you want me to say . You 'll make a good father . Someday , ja . - So you want to have a
zone2	want some kids of your own ? If I could , I would . But these kids , and a few back home in the Rif Mountains , I sort of see them as my own . Then I guess they 're mine , too . Jesus . Who are you ? Do you speak English ? Francais ? Arabic ? Answer me ! I 'm sorry . Please . Just ... Just say something . Anything . They told me not to . How many are there ? You can whisper . - About 10 . - Are you part of their group ? No . Then how do you know them ? They hired me to bandage your finger . They 're going ... They 're going to kill me . Then why would they hire me to bandage your wound ? When did they hire you ? - Yesterday . - Until when ? Tomorrow . And when tomorrow comes , do you think they will just pay you and let you go ? - Yes . - No . You 've seen my face . -
zone2	I can not . Then how can you see my hand ? It is very difficult . I know . You 're hurting me . But I am trying to help you . Well , then please , take off your veil and bandage it properly . Did they blindfold you before they brought you here ? No . So ... So you know where we are ? - Yes . - Are we still in Morocco ? - They 've told me not to tell you . - Or did we move south , to Nigeria ? - I said I can not tell you . - They 're going to kill you anyway . - I will not listen to you . - You have to . I do n't want to die like this . Then tell them . - Tell them what ? - Where the money came from . How do you know that ? I heard them talking . And they said they want the money ? Yes . That is what they said . Did they say how much money ? The million
zone2	- For what ? - Lf you ... If you get me out of here . - Half a million dollars ? - That 's right . Half a million dollars . - What is all this money for ? - My food programme . - Have you heard of it ? - No . I 'm here to help your people . There is nothing I can do . - Are you hungry ? - Yes . I have n't eaten for ... - How long have I been here ? - I do n't know . I brought this for lunch . Perhaps this is my food programme . Thanks . Thanks . I am sorry . I could not help you . No , no , no . Do n't . Wait . - You still can . - How ? When you leave here , you can tell someone you saw me . Tell them where I am . People around here , they will not risk their lives for a Dutch tourist . What about the police ? Or the Embassy ? You could tell
zone2	What do you mean ? - Just what I said . Then we must have gone south , at least to the Sahel . - I did not tell you that . - I 'm a supporter . My girlfriend is Moroccan . I never said we were in Morocco . Then where are we ? Even if you knew , what good would that do ? What about your friends ? - My friends ? - I could try to call them . No . - Why not ? - The police . Call the police . The police are corrupt . - My friends ca n't help . - Well , neither can the police . It is better to call your friends . If you just give me their names ... Why do you want to know their names ? To call them . So they can help you . No . That is n't it . I ca n't believe I almost fell for it . - Fell for what ? - You almost had me ! You almost had me ! Who are you talking
zone2	You 're fucking good ! What are you talking about ? You 're not here to bandage my hand . You 're here to talk to me . No , they told me not to talk to you . That 's what they told you to say . Well , it wo n't work ! Tell me who your friends are . Tell me where the money came from . - Tell me where the money came from . - I embezzled it . - From who ? - The bank ! - With your friends ? - I did it alone ! You are lying . My new best friend . I brought you something . - You have a request ? - Perhaps you can teach me how to play . Okay . Meet me at my flat every Thursday at 4:00 . Good , very good . I thought you might be getting homesick , so I also brought you some reading material . You mind reading them out loud ? I 'm a bit tied up at the moment . I am very happy to see
zone2	Serves me well in times of torture . The real Martijn emerges . Glib . Strong . Defiant in the face of extreme pain . I like that . Shall we see what everyone else is saying about you ? " Germany and Poland seek labour deal to ease EU enlargement . " " Six Palestinians killed in Israeli air strike . " Here is something . " Two Europeans missing in North Africa . " I am sorry , Martijn . No , not you . These men are French . Totally separate incident . What 's your point ? Come , come , Martijn . You are a perceptive man . Do n't you have a grieving mother ? Or sister ? What about your Moroccan girlfriend ? Has she noticed that you are missing ? My mother died six years ago . My sister is living in Spain . My girlfriend thinks I 'm in the Rif Mountains , helping her people . You expect me to believe that ? What do you believe ? I believe that the press knows everything . In fact , I
zone2	them everything . Then why has n't it been reported ? That , my friend , is the question . They are pretending that you do n't exist . What kind of people does this happen to , Martijn ? I do n't know . - What are you doing in Morocco ? - Setting up a food programme . Then why could our sources not confirm this ? Because it has n't been set up yet . Please , explain . Should n't need to be told . If you 're working with the people , you 'd know about my food programme . It 's been in development for months . With such careful planning , perhaps more people would be aware of it . The right people know . They have forgotten you , Martijn . I think we are the only one's that remember you now , eh ? Make it easy on yourself . Do n't be foolish . Tell us who your friends are . Tell me who you are . Are you with the movement ? It is more appropriate to say that
zone2	want to know the names of my friends ? You know why . - Someone gave you my name ? - We have our sources . - What sources ? - Does it matter ? Yes ! Of course it matters . Do n't you see ? This mistrust has to end . Mistrust . Between who ? Between people like you and people like me . We 're both working for the same goal . - You are Muslim ? - No . Just a servant to the cause . - What cause ? - The cause of the people . What people are you talking about , Martijn ? Just let me go . - They lied about me . - They lied about you ? Who lied about you ? For what reason , eh ? Some person , ja . The one that gave you my name . They never knew me , they just pretended to know me . You know , Martijn , it is an interesting theory . It 's the truth ! Yes , but it does not explain one thing .
zone2	. - I told you how I got that money ! - Yes . You expect me to believe that a low-level private banker in Amsterdam embezzled $1 million without anyone discovering it . I risked everything . Everything to get that money to fund my food programme ! We told the bank about your capture . We have had no response . Do n't you find that odd ? If you had stolen that much money , they would want you back . They would want the money back . I 'll sign it over to you . - The money ? - Yes . Yes , the money . How did you get it ? I said I 'd give it to you , all of it . - We do n't want your money , Martijn . - Then what do you want ? Why did you call Hassan Fikri ? - I ... What is Hassan Fikri ? - One of your friends . I do n't ... I do n't ... Marhaba . Mr Fikri , please . There is no Mr Fikri here .
zone2	. There is no Hassan Fikri here . You have been misinformed . - Why did you make that phone call , Martijn ? - That 's not me . - Stop lying . - I do n't ... I do n't even know who he is . - Then who gave you his number ? - No one . - How did you know to call him ? - I never called him ! He is a jazz musician , eh ? No , no . He is the one who gave you my name , and he made that tape to ... Stop this fantasy , Martijn . No one gave us your name . You know why you are here . Ja ! Do you ? Understand , Martijn , there is a reason for all of this , a very good one ! Then tell me the reason . Tell me who you are , who you are with . - You know who we are . - No , I do n't ! But you have your suspicions , yes ? That is why you
zone2	finding this man is like finding a needle in the ear of a camel . So you found a guide , someone who said he knew the area , someone who could protect you . But Gavin did not protect you . - Not well enough . - Not well at all . You have to admit , hiring Gavin was a big mistake . I do n't know what happened . You have been fucked , Martijn . Just call me Lawrence of Morocco . That is a good one . Your best one yet , in fact . Why are you doing this to me ? Because I know Hassan Fikri . He is a retired chemist . So ? He has been working on a form of bacteria . What kind of bacteria ? You already know ! That is why you called him . I did n't call him . You called to find out about this bacteria . About how it can be disseminated through food . - I do n't know what your business ... - This bacteria is fatal . - Why would
zone2	were paid to . I stole that money ! You were paid that money to call Hassan Fikri , to find out what you could ! That is why you came to Morocco . - I 'm a banker . - That is just your cover . - For what ? - You are paid in US dollars to collect evidence on Hassan Fikri . - You 're wrong . - I would like to believe you . - Then believe me . - How can I , when I know the evidence ? What evidence ? That tape was fake . The money in your account , why is it not in euros ? I told you so many times . Who has that kind of power to make that kind of money appear - From nowhere ? - Nobody . Who has that kind of power to stop the papers from running a story ? I do n't ... I do n't know ! - Who gave you the name of Hassan Fikri ? - I did n't call him . The Agency ! What agency ? It
zone2	for the CIA ? We know you work for the CIA . Yes , yes . - It 's crazy . - Is it ? I 'm not even American . But you sympathize with the Americans . I am from Holland . Why would I sympathize with America ? Because they paid you $1 million . You think I got that money from the CIA ? What else could we think ? I 'd laugh . If it was n't so horrible , I 'd fucking laugh . Tell us who your friends are . Your contacts . - There are no contacts . - What about your girlfriend ? - What about her ? - Did she recruit you ? Saadia has nothing to do with this . - Is she your handler ? - She does not work for the CIA ! No , not again . No , not again . Please . No , not again . Please . Please . Please . Please . It 's a gift . What kind of gift ? For the children . But why all the secrecy ?
zone2	But why ? As long as they help my kids , I do n't care . As simple as that . It 's never that simple . Can you set up a numbered account ? It 's really a little bit tricky without a passport . - Euros or dollars ? - Dollars . - Maybe I should meet this friend . - Maybe you should . You 're actually a lot alike . - Is he Dutch ? - No , he 's American . Wow ! An American that thinks the way that I do . - That is someone I have to meet . - Okay . Can you hear me ? Can you hear me ? I know you can hear me ! I know you can hear me ! Relax . I am just here to remove your clothes . Why ? You have soiled your pants , and you have not had a bath for days . Now , please cooperate . Now your pants . Are you going to wash me ? You are going to wash yourself . Ca n't . There
zone2	- Like what ? - My beliefs . You are a banker . You believe in making money . I was a banker . And now ? I 'm here to help . Why do n't you just go back to Holland and leave us alone ? - I can't . - Why not ? You may approach it differently . For you , it 's spiritual . For me , it 's ideologue . But in the end we 're the same . We support the people for the same basic reason . And what reason is that ? Because we both know there is more to life than money . Then why did you steal $1 million ? It is n't for me . Then who is it for ? Not who , but what . You think this is going to make a difference ? - Your food programme ? - Yes , I do . Suppose it works . Then what ? Then I 'll keep on fighting until everyone is forced to start over . No more Western World . No more Third World .
zone2	debts , no more creditors . A worldwide social system . You are still a banker . I was fired . And why is that ? Did they find out about the money ? No . They saw pictures of me . - Doing what ? - Protesting . Protesting . Against who ? Dutch immigration policy and our government 's support of the World Bank . You honestly believe that to protest against the World Bank would accomplish something ? I did . I used to think it could accomplish a lot . But not anymore ? - Not that way , no . - Of course not . Because you are a child , Martijn . An idealistic , stupid child who is playing a very dangerous game . You go away for a weekend , throw a few stones , swallow a little tear gas and tell your girlfriend how risky it was . And while she is sucking on your cock , your government expels 40,000 asylum seekers . You have no idea what it would really take to change the world . You 're wrong
zone2	, events that would destroy the world 's richest companies , that would crush the world 's economy . A dozen 9l11s all over the world . Like what ? Like targeted direct action against Halliburton . Against Dow Chemical , against McDonald 's . And not just American companies . Against Airbus , against British Petroleum . Against any company that promotes global capitalism and destroys lives and cultures in order to increase its profits . The Agency has trained you well . I am not with the CIA . You are clean . It 's an insult , what you think of me . There is no other explanation . I hate the CIA . I hate everything they stand for . So you claim . What about you ? What about me ? Are you a good Muslim ? Yes . Then why are n't you wearing your veil ? You are right . I never should have taken it off . I 'm glad you did . This is why we wear veils . So men are not distracted . Are you distracted by me ?
zone2	not weak . It is true . It takes a strong man to hold out for so long . To keep lying through your clean , white teeth . I 've told you the truth . - That you came here to help us ? - And the rest of the world . Through catastrophic events . At the moment , just one . Which you already have planned ? Yes . With your help . - But I know nothing of it . - But you know Hassan Fikri . That 's why this is so wrong . So that is why you raised $1 million ? - To fund this event ? - Yes . Then what is it ? I can not tell you . Because even if I 'm killed over some stupid mistake , there are others who may still make it happen . - Yes . Your friends . - Our friends . If they were our friends , Martijn , I would know who they are . Not necessarily . You are lying . I 've only said this much to convince you
zone2	not tell this to Ahmat ? - Because he 'd never believe me . - And I would ? - At least I can try . I have taken your fingers . I will do it again . I have convictions , too . Tell me what you have planned . Tell me about your food programme . Do it . They have trained you well . - Is that your friend ? - Yeah . What 's wrong ? - You think he 'll fund it ? - Your food programme ? Our food programme . But I do n't know nothing about your food programme . You know me . And that 's all I need to know . We 're gon na change the world . I love you . I love you , too . What 's that ? They can still be sewn back on . It will require a fine surgeon , but it is possible . Why are you showing me this ? Because Aicha seems to think that we are wrong about you . So I made some inquiries . She may
zone2	you were an atheist . It 's only an expression . If she is mistaken , I still have this . I already told her the truth . Protesting against the World Bank proves nothing . It could just be a part of your cover . You 're right , you 're right . Does n't prove anything . So tell me , Martijn , why did you try to contact Hassan Fikri ? I ca n't tell you that . I can only confirm what you already know . What if I were to tell you my own little secret ? What secret ? That I am Hassan Fikri . Ja . Makes perfect sense . - What do you mean ? - It 's ... It 's safer to use an alias . Yes , much safer . And I 'd heard rumours that you were from Nigeria . Rumours ? From who ? People in the network . They suggested I call you , but you were n't expecting my call . No , I was not . You did n't know who I was so you
zone2	. Why were you calling me ? - You do n't know ? Not even now ? - Perhaps I do . - You 've made inquiries ? - Yes . - Then you know who I am . - I know who you might be . - He needs confirmation . - What kind of confirmation ? He needs to know you are really who you claim to be . There is a terrorist cell in Holland that our network agreed to finance . - Then you know how I got the money ? - No . There was a miscommunication . Yes , but now you know . We know that it is possible . Of course it 's possible . It 's the fucking truth . - Convince us . - Convince you of what ? That you are a part of the Dutch cell . Okay . What were you recruited to do ? I have friends in food distribution centres across the EU . They are willing to take action , and the security is weak . You have identified a target ? I 'm

So a few fat Americans will have their potbellies incinerated . A few ? Try thousands if not hundreds of thousands in one single day . By the time they shut us down , we will have killed a hundred times more people than Osama bin Laden ! How do you intend to poison the food ? With the bacteria that you 're developing . How did you learn about the bacteria ? From the network . Why did you need $1 million ? To cover the lab costs , to cover the materials . - What materials ? - You 're the fucking chemist . You tell me . No , no , no , it must have been a miscommunication . I thought you did not speak Arabic . I picked up a few words from my girlfriend . - A miscommunication . - Yes . Yes . One that 's already cost me four fingers . - The
zone2	to be . - No . I am not convinced . - What ... - What would convince you ? - The money . Where did it come from ? From someone who believed in the value of the operation . - Someone outside the network ? - Yes , yes , that is correct . But how do you know they are your friend ? Who else would give me that kind of money ? The CIA . How would the CIA know about you ? That is exactly what I am trying to find out , Martijn . This is going nowhere . Convince us the money did not come from the CIA . - How ? - Trace it back to your friend . - The money is untraceable . - Why ? Because I designed it that way . I used to work for a fucking bank . Here . Drink that . I am sorry , Martijn . But we can not afford to risk the entire network for the sake of one operation . An important operation . Yes , but imagine if we
zone2	eh ? I am sorry it had to happen this way . I am sorry about your fingers . But you are prepared to die for the cause , no ? - Yes , but ... - But what ? - I understand . I do , but ... - But what ? I just wish there was some way I could convince you . - So do I . - After all , I am a rarity . What do you mean ? I have blonde hair , blue eyes and a Dutch passport . How many dedicated sympathizers do you know that look like me ? We could do great things . What about the names ? We have the names . What names ? Last night , the network gave us the names , the names of the members of the Dutch cell . - So ... So , you have my name . - Unfortunately not . That 's not possible . - I 'm new ... I 'm new to the network . - Or perhaps you are lying . If Martijn knows the names
zone2	network . - The Agency might also have those names . - La . If the Agency had the names , they would have already arrested the entire cell . She 's right . The CIA ca n't know . The only one who knows those names is me . - It is the only way to prove it . - There is a hole in the logic . - No , Ahmat . - There must be . Let him do it . Let him prove it . For the sake of his food programme . All right . You 're doing the right thing . We shall see . My food programme is a big operation . It 's important . Something to write with . You are very lucky . If not for her , you would be dead . You will write the names of the Dutch cell and the person that gave you that money . - You first . - Me ? - Why me ? - How else do I know that you 're not lying ? You will only copy what I

He would n't have given us anything else . How do you know ? Because I know . - How do you feel ? - Like shite . You know , you were supposed to stand 10 feet away . - I had to make it look convincing . - Yeah . I had powder burns all over my face , for fuck 's sake . - Squibs hurt , huh ? - Yeah . My spine 's still sore . You 'll live , baby . Listen , get back out on the Net .

There are billions of people on this planet . What the fuck put four total individuals together on the stage in Greenford to make this music ? What the fuck did that ? ( **26;3168;TOOLONG ) ( AIRRAIDSIRENBLARING ) ( BOMBSEXPLODING ) TOWNSHEND : Towards the end of the war , everything was secret . You never knew whether you were winning or losing , and most of the time they were saying you were winning when you felt that you were losing . I was born into that world . I was born in the hour that Albert Speer was arrested . He was Hitler 's premier architect . I do n't mean war architect . He was an actual architect . My father got these two messages . One was , " Speer 's been captured , " and the other was , " It 's a boy , Mr . Townshend . " DALTREY
zone2	' 40s , ' 50s , it 's almost like the world was black and white . It is very weird . Very Spartan living . We were still on food rationing . No cars in the street . ENTWISTLE : After the war there was like bombed-out buildings that had loads of bricks , so we did n't need Lego . We had the real thing . TOWNSHEND : Practically everybody that I know that I grew up with , if they were wild and crazy and weird , or in a band , the chances were that they had some weird shit happen to them when they were kids . My parents were both working dance-band musicians , and I grew up with the music of my father , which was the Basie Band , the Ellington Band , and great singers like Sarah Vaughan and Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald . And I felt I could n't even begin to emulate or occupy their territory . ( JAZZMUSICPLAYING ) We were all interested in traditional jazz at the time . To me , trad jazz was something that
zone2	dance-hall dance music that my father played . NARRATOR : The first connection between the four talents of The Who came in 1959 at a West London boys ' school . TOWNSHEND : I met John at Acton County Grammar School . Big guy . Funny . Very sharply dressed . John and Pete did n't really get to know one another well until they started at playing instruments together . Right from the beginning and right the way through our life , he was a great musical ally . ( **33;3196;TOOLONG ) Right over here , you 're ... John . You 're John ? John . And you 're from ... London , too . From London , too ? Yeah . He was calling himself John Allison because his girlfriend was , of course , called Allison . We thought " Entwistle " was a really strange name for a band member . And we tried John Brown , and we thought , " Well , no . " " He 's John Entwistle . " The Who would n't have been The Who without Entwistle .
zone2	If you actually listen to any Who record and you isolate the bass , it 's pretty astonishing what he 's doing . It 's nothing to do with what a normal bass player would do . ( SINGING ) I 'm gon na raise a fuss I 'm gon na raise a holler Entwistle stood still . CHRIS ENTWISTLE : You had Pete swinging his arm around like a windmill , you had Roger throwing his microphone around all over the place , Keith smacking away at the drums , and Dad stood away in the corner playing quietly . ( SINGING ) My boss said No dice , son , you got ta work late Sometimes I wonder WISE : I used to get cross that they did n't show John so much on the television . The cameras were always on Pete and Roge . He was like the central point in the spinning world , you know . I think a lot of people do n't understand is that what he was doing is he was playing like a Bach organ . It was huge ,
zone2	my way inside that . And I used to sit with John and sit inside , and he would follow me and support me and we 'd play together . EDGE : John had such facility as a player and really very unique . I do n't think anyone had really gone into lead bass playing . STAMP : He was n't actually a quiet guy . He was just a very sardonic guy . Very cynical . He was very funny , but in that sort of laid-back way . CURBISHLEY : Entwistle was uncompromising in leading his own life , you know . JOHNS : Afraid John takes after me . I like music , dancing , enjoying myself , drinking . I love partying . I never , ever felt that John had any addictive problems at all , except one , which began with an " H . " It 's a big shop in London called Harrods . That was his one addiction . ALLISON : He could never buy one pair of shoes , he always bought a dozen , in each color ,
zone2	well-dressed . Do n't know about that skeleton fucking leather thing , though , that John Entwistle was ... What 's all that about ? JOHNS : He was very musical right from the age of three . He knew all the pop songs that were in the charts . And he 'd sing for hours . My first date with John was to go to a Boys ' Brigade thing at the Albert Hall . He used to play the bugle . He joined the school orchestra . He wanted to play the trumpet , but they did n't have any left . The only instrument left was the French horn . He practiced in the loo . He became quite proficient . DALTREY : John Entwistle was the only one of us that kind of had any musical training at all . TOWNSHEND : He made his own first bass with his own hands , you know . What he realized was that he had the power to change the fucking instrument . You know , you do n't change the trumpet . But the base guitar was
zone2	hold it differently . Being on stage with a guitar , with a big amplifier , it became his voice . DALTREY : I was walking down the road one day coming home from work , I worked in a sheet-metalwork factory . I noticed this guy coming towards me who I recognized from being at school . And across his shoulder he 's got this strange-Iooking instrument . So , I said to him , you know , stupidly , " What you got there ? " He said , " It 's a bass ! " They all went to the same school . Roger was at the same school , but he got expelled . ALLISON : I think he was accused of setting fire to the school . Roger was a bit of a tearaway . DALTREY : It 's been said that I was a bully later on in my school career . But I do n't think I actually was . I just loved to fight . Still do . TOWNSHEND : When I first met Roger , he was one of the most
zone2	'd ever come across . You know , he was like Elvis Presley . DALTREY : Elvis , to me , was the guy I wanted to be . But realistically , the guy who showed me that I could ... Instead of just dreaming about this , could actually go out there and do it , was a guy called Lonnie Donegan . ( PLAYINGPUTTINGONTHESTYLE ) ( SINGING ) Sweet 16 Goes to church just to see the boys Lonnie Donegan was a big influence on a lot of people . It was the rhythm , the beat , and the freshness of it . ( SINGING ) He 's only putting on the style , yeah Putting on the agony Putting on the style It had that kind of rock and roll sort of pace to it . Skiffle is really basically , early American folk songs . It was so easy . Anyone could make a skiffle groove . You could do it with home objects . For drums , we had an old washing board . Tea-chest bass , which is basically a tea chest with
zone2	the music from , like , big bands into people 's parlors . You could do it yourself , like . DALTREY : Every street in Shepherd 's Bush had its own skiffle group . NARRATOR : On Fielding Road , Roger Daltrey founded The Detours with a guitar he made himself at the sheet-metal factory . At the age of 17 or 18 , you know , he was the king of the neighborhood . So anyway , I 'm walking home from work one night , and immediately I kind of felt a bonding with this guy . So I said , " You in a band ? " And he said , " Yeah , I 'm in a band . " I said , " Well , you know , have you got any work ? " He said , " No . " I said , " Well , we have . " You know , I said , " Do you get paid when you work ? " He said , " No . " I said , " We do . " I
zone2	you know , we 're looking for a bass player . " Would you like to join ? " Shortly after , Reg Bowen , on rhythm guitar , left the band , John said , " Well , I know someone who 's a good rhythm player . " So , we said , " Well , bring him along . " John was very important for me because he never let me go . He could 've done . A couple of the other guys did let me go . John was very encouraging to me , and nurturing , and he used to constantly say to me , " No , you 're a good musician . " He was just vital to me in those days . NARRATOR : By 1962 , The Detours were playing pubs as a five-piece . John on bass , Doug Sandom on the drums , Pete played rhythm guitar , Colin Dawson singing , Roger playing lead guitar . It was Roger 's band . The Detours were Roger 's band . And Roger was the driving force . And
zone2	van , and he picked people up and he arranged everything . ( SINGING ) Someway , someday I 'll find a way To make you see my way NARRATOR : In ' 63 , Roger gave up the guitar , fired the singer , and took over as frontman . When there was just the three of us as a band , just two instruments , Pete and John , the only thing with strings was Pete and John , and I remember saying to him , " It sounds fucking great ! " ( SINGING ) You see my way ( MANSINGINGBLUES ) Oh , yeah Oh , yeah Everything gon na be all right this morning TOWNSHEND : All the other guys in the band were working for a living , you know , and I was at art school . I was on a grant . I was having an easy life . I was smoking dope , listening to , you know , records . BARNES : I met Pete when we were in art school , and I did n't even know he was
zone2	had belonged to this American guy , Tom Wright . DALTREY : Tom Wright , who had a huge blues archive from the States ... ( SINGING ) Now , when I was a young boy At the age of five All that early blues stuff , John Lee Hooker , Howlin ' Wolf , Jimmy Reed ... STAMP : All those young kids loved the blues , because the working class was in a similar sociological position . You know what I mean ? To the blacks in America . My father was in the war . His ship gets torpedoed . My mother , who 's pregnant , goes to the shipping office , as she did every week , to get his salary . And they say , " Oh , no , there 's no salary this week , Mrs . Stamp . " The ship 's gone down . " Right ? So that was the status of the working class , right ? ( MANSINGING ) Well , it 's a shame , shame , shame Shame , shame on you We identified with
zone2	started listening to that , and we thought , " Well this is great . " And we started playing the blues . I played the harmonica . Through that music we became aware of the limitations of our drummer . NARRATOR : Doug Sandom was fired in April of 1964 . DALTREY : So we got a session drummer in for a couple of gigs we had lined up . And we were playing one night at the Oldfield Hotel in Greenford . All I remember is I was standing on stage getting ready to take a break , ( STAMMERING ) When a gingerbread man appeared in the audience in front of me , looking up at me with his great big puppy-dog brown eyes . ( CHUCKLING ) He wanted to be a Beach Boy so he bought some hydrogen peroxide and bleached his hair and it 'd come out bright orange . And he came up , and with all the arrogance in the world , you know , " I hear you 're looking for a drummer . " Well , I 'm much better
zone2	down . Peter starts off with a pick screeching down the string . And it gets into a very heavy rift . All of a sudden it 's like a jet engine started up in the back of me . It was like magic . All of a sudden , everything worked . We were just astonished . This kid was the missing link . And it was obvious from the first minute of him playing with us . The whole dance floor stopped and started looking . It was extraordinary . BARNES : You did n't watch drummers . He was the only drummer I know that you 'd watch . Moon was a star . He was a shooting star , that 's what he was . He was clearly an alcoholic , an addict , a sex addict . ( WHOAREYOUPLAYING ) ( SINGING ) Who are you ? Who , who ? Who , who ? GOLDSMITH : On the one hand , he was this lunatic who , you know , could n't wait to get on a drum kit and just explode with it
zone2	the other hand , he was a very quiet , saddened person . ( SINGING ) Who are you ? TOWNSHEND : He clearly had tremendous esteem issue problems . He was a complex little ball of difficulty . ( INTERVIEWERSPEAKING ) Just leave and get drunk . He was n't like that as a boy . That 's what I ca n't understand . I mean , he always did as he was told . He was very quiet and I had no problem with him at all . He was good boy . NARRATOR : By the time he was 16 , Moon was playing American surf music in a band called The Beachcombers . The Beachcombers was the first band I remember him having at home and setting up in the front room . Keith liked the Beach Boys . I did n't like them . ( SINGINGMOCKINGLY ) " ... fun , fun , fun till her daddy takes the T-Bird away " Woo , woo Woo , woo ... You know , and they would sing away . ( SINGING ) Ba ba ba ba
zone2	Barbara Ann You got me rockin ' and a-rollin ' Rockin ' and a-reelin ' Barbara Ann TOWNSHEND : He liked to do those backing vocals , you know , the girlie backing vocals in a lot of the songs . The other thing that 's really important , of course , is that Keith was a very lyrical drummer . Keith was like an orchestra on the drums . He was n't a time drummer like ... ( IMITATESSIMPLERHYTHM ) It was , like , all around the kit . DALTREY : Moon was doing things that just made us all work 100% harder . Not faster , not slower , 100% harder . ( LEAVINGHEREPLAYING ) NARRATOR : In late April , 1964 , he joined The Detours and started playing the blues . ( SINGING ) Hey , fellas , have you heard the news ? DALTREY : When you 've got a 12-bar sequence , can become monotonous . Moonie had " a very short attention span when it came to boredom . He started to double up the beat . And that led to Pete
zone2	jazzy bits in between , and from that , what we became famous for evolved . That 's when The Who started to have its own identity . We played the blues , but we 'd put our own stamp on it . We 'd been The Detours for quite a while , and we 'd built up quite a following in West London on the pub circuit . TOWNSHEND : John Entwistle , he 'd heard about this band who 'd got a record out in America called The Detours . So we sat around and had this think tank in Sunnyside Road , where Barney and I had a flat . And the band never came back there . I do n't think they 'd ever been before . Because Pete and I were art students smoking dope , and they did n't approve . And we were just jokingly throwing names around . BARNES : We were trying to be avant-garde or something . Think of like , " The Nothing , " or things with names like that . I came up with " The Hair
zone2	about hair at the time . BARNES : And I said " The Who , " ' cause basically I was just thinking of it on posters . You know , it 's one of those very quick conversations . " The Hair ! " " The Who ! " And everybody was laughing at each one . And for awhile , it was kind of a bit of a war . I said , " Well , we could call it ' The Hair and The Who . " ' It sounded like a pub . DALTREY : But The Who was something we came back to . It did n't take very long for us to carry our audience into the change . Within two weeks , they 'd forgotten about The Detours and they knew that it was The Who . ( CUTMYHAIRPLAYING ) ( SINGING ) I 'm dressed right for a beach fight But I just ca n't explain JONES : We were the first teenagers after the war . All we wanted to do was just liberate ourselves , really , and have fun
zone2	the fights between rival gangs of Mods and Rockers continue ... CURBISHLEY : We used to go Brighton , areas like that , and it was traditional that you would end up clashing . We were teenagers together . We were Mods . It was all about pop-art gang culture . STAMP : We were called Mods ' cause we were modernist . There was a type of , like , " Fuck you , " rebellious sort of behavior about the Mod kids . It was very much , " Let 's get out of this class system . " SHAW : The original Mods were very smart . Short , Italian jackets , tight trousers , Winkle Picker shoes . STAMP : Perfectly tailored sort of skintight sort of sharkskin suits , with a little mascara on and a special haircut on Saturday nights . CURBISHLEY : We spent all of our money on clothes . We were like little peacocks . ( SINGING ) I 'm the hippiest number in town And I 'll tell you why And I 'll tell you why I 'm the snappiest
zone2	tie Along came this guy called Pete Meaden . He was a publicist . And he transformed the band . DALTREY : He certainly had a finger on the pulse of this embryo of a fashion seed . And Pete Meaden had this theory that the Mods were like the new religion , the new army , the new everything , and projected that onto us as individuals . DALTREY : He said , " Right , get out there , cut your hair , " go out Carnaby Street , buy all the clever gear , " and all of a sudden , we 're a Mod band . Pete Meaden also said , " You 've got to change the name , The Who . " And in that sense , he was right in getting us to be Mods . But he was wrong in changing the name The Who to The High Numbers . We kept seeing these posters for The High Numbers , " The Who " in brackets . ALAN GARRISON : They used to play in West Hampstead at the Railway Club .
zone2	hall . The Who came up as The High Numbers , and we did n't know who they were . We just went up there . And the drummer was absolutely mental . ( **34;3231;TOOLONG ) ( SINGING ) Gather ' round , my friends , here Help me forget my hurting tears About the only girl I ever loved The only one , baby I got ta dance just to keep from crying Got ta dance just to keep from crying Whoa , do the flop Do the flop Do the twist Do the twist Everybody , it goes like this You got ta dance got me swaying got me , all right Got ta dance got me swaying got me , all right Do the bird Do the bird Do the fly Do the fly Come on , gang , you know By , by , by , oh , yeah They were amazing . But it was nothing like the Beatles , even the Stones , you know . It was nothing like that . And they were playing music that you did n't hear very often
zone2	band and I was a Mod . ( SINGING ) Yeah , baby , so you know it 's all right STAMP : When I met Kit , we decided to start to come up with an idea to make a film . We came up with a concept that we would find a group , we would manage the group to success , and we would all the time film it . This was the idea . Kit and I , we went up and down England looking for a group . We could n't find anyone to put in the film , basically , until we saw The High Numbers . ( SINGING ) Let me tell you ' bout ooh poo pah doo They call me the most Yeah , ooh poo pah doo They call me the most Lambert said immediately he knew that was the band he was looking for . ( SINGING ) Yeah , and I wo n't stop trying Till I create a disturbance DALTREY : We met Lambert and Stamp , and the first thing they wanted to do ... They
zone2	. And when we told them we used to be called The Who , they went , " Great ! " STAMP : They were very individual . They did n't really get along , you know , that personally . I 'd been in a gang in my adolescence . It was n't that different . SHAW : They just came across ... Not antisocial , but they were n't there to try to please people . They were there to do what they were gon na do , and if you liked it , that 's up to you . Pete was using just very high-volume amplifiers . He would , because of the power in the amplifier , create feedback . ( FEEDBACKSCREECHING ) He did this thing where he used to lift the guitar up like this . We had a very low ceiling there . I used to bang it to make it go boing , boing , boing , boing . BARNES : And the guitar neck went through the ceiling . And when it broke , I thought , " Well , I
zone2	stood there and ... " What is going on here ? It 's great . " ( LAUGHING ) I mean , nobody had ever smashed anything on a stage . I saw Keith looking at me . Next week I start banging my other guitar and immediately the drums were over , sticks through . BARNES : Pete said afterwards , " Once I knew that Moonie was with me , then I would do it again . " TOWNSHEND : The guitar became , when it was electrified , in my case , an instrument of control , aggression , latent violence . People say to me , you know , " It 's just stagecraft , is n't it ? " Just showing off , smashing your guitar . " You know , to me it was far , far , far more than that . NARRATOR : At art school , Pete and Barnesy had attended lectures by Gustav Metzger , a German artist who destroyed his creations as a political protest against nuclear weapons . TOWNSHEND : Gustav Metzger came to my college to do
zone2	. Yoko Ono did that thing where she had her clothes cut up , and he slashed his way through a canvas with a samurai sword , and next thing I knew I 'm breaking up guitars at gigs . STAMP : I thought it was a bit sort of airy-fairy , do you know what I mean ? It was a bit sort of like , " Why bother , " you know ? " You 're fucking angry , you 're smashing your guitar up , " it looks great , " you know . It does suggest the rage that we all feel . DALTREY : It really did annoy me that the visual kind of took over from what was really going on . I 'd even have the guys in the band going , " What a lot of pompous , pretentious drivel . " And I 'd go , " No , it 's autodestructive art ! " Pete , even in those days , was in a class of his own . It was this act , you know , smashing up the
zone2	did this sort of thing that the kids called the Birdman . DALTREY : Lambert and Stamp got us a gig at the Marquee in the west end of London . And Kit had this poster made of Pete with a guitar and the bird-like ... Sideways , and the profile of his nose . Fabulous . Absolutely classic . You could not ignore that poster . It was , like , " What is The Who ? " Within a month , the queues would be all the way down Waldorf Street , and they would be turning thousands of people away . It was incredible . I 've got to admit that I felt that we were special . ( SINGING ) Whenever she calls my name Yeah , yeah , yeah I ca n't explain I feel I feel And I feel I feel I feel this burning pain DALTREY : It 's to do with attitude . It 's like , you can hit your hand like that , that 's a tempo . Or you can hit it like this . Now , it 's
zone2	at all . And The Who always did it with that attitude of drive . ( SINGING ) Oh , yeah Oh , yeah Oh , yeah Oh , yeah Heatwave Burning in my heart Heatwave DALTREY : I remember that the one thing that we were very much aware of was that we were still copying other people 's songs . NARRATOR : By 1964 , The Beatles were revolutionizing popular music with their songwriting . The Rolling Stones and the Kinks joined the British invasion of America by recording original material . ( SINGING ) Girl , you really got me going You got me so I do n't know what I 'm doing We needed a songwriter in the group , and Pete turned out to be one . TOWNSHEND : I listened to a couple of Kinks songs and just produced this rhythm . ( PLAYINGICAN'TEXPLAIN ) ( SINGING ) Got a feeling inside Ca n't explain It 's a certain kind Ca n't explain I feel hot and cold Ca n't explain Yeah , down in my soul , yeah Ca n't explain DALTREY :
zone2	appears to be a very frilly little pop song is a much , much bigger statement from the vocal . You know , " I 've got a feeling inside I ca n't explain . " And you could see that Townshend as a writer had a huge potential . ' Cause he was n't going the normal way that pop songs go . It was going internal . Ca n't explain I think it 's love Try to say it to you when I feel blue But I ca n't explain But back in those early days , I thought , you know , " I 'm not gon na write songs forever , " you know ? " This is boring . " You know ? I really thought Ca n't Explain was quite childish . NARRATOR : Pete 's home-recorded demo of the song would get them signed . He was 19 . He had it on tape , which I played over the phone to Shel Talmy . The demo I heard was about a minute and 10 seconds long . Probably safe to say in
zone2	" Yes ! " I said , " I will get us a deal . " DALTREY : Kit told us this recording deal . And I mean , I 'm a Shepherd 's Bush boy . You know , I work the markets . When Kit told us our percentage , it had something like a couple of cents on the end of it . BARNES : When Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp were managing the band , they got a very bad deal then . SHAW : I went around to all the record shops , gave them free copies , gave them posters . And I helped push it that way . But then , luckily , Radio Caroline played it . ( WOMANSINGING ) Caroline , sign of the nation Caroline ! ( **27;3267;TOOLONG ) RADIO DJ : 12:00 midnight tonight . Steve Young along until 3:00 a . M ... THE WHO ON RADIO : Got a feeling inside Ca n't explain Radio Caroline was the first of the pirate radio station . ' Cause radio was controlled in England by the BBC . And
zone2	the music out into England and took off like a rocket . DALTREY : The truth is , without pirate radio , the English invasion and all that pop scene would not have happened . ( SINGING ) Ca n't explain I think it 's love Try to say it to you when I feel blue I ca n't explain NARRATOR : Released January 15 , 1965 , I Ca n't Explain would climb to number eight on the new Musical Express chart . TOWNSHEND : I was driving over Hammersmith Flyover and heard Ca n't Explain on the radio , and thought , " Wow ! " You know , " I 've got a commission , I 've got a patron , " This is art . " NARRATOR : Brunswick Records sold 104,000 copies of the single . The boys made ? 250 each . ( SINGING ) I said I ca n't explain (
zone2	audience_cheering ) It was chaos , ' cause we were smashing up all this equipment , and I had no money . I used to take all Pete 's guitars and in
zone2	... While one was being glued , the other one would be all set from the day before . And the main thing was " Keep the band working . " ( AUDIENCESCREAMING ) ( SINGING ) I can go any way Way I choose I can live anyhow Win or lose I can go anywhere DALTREY : In those days , it was n't uncommon for us to do a show at 8:00 till 9:00 , travel 150 miles , and then do another show at midnight till 1:00 We used to take amphetamines . Only I discovered that taking amphetamines did n't go with being a good singer . ( SINGING ) Oh , see C . C . Rider Oh , see What you have done now DALTREY : And it build up like no tomorrow , and their playing became just a noise . The tempos went out the window , volumes went out the window , and everything we 'd worked to be good at suddenly disappeared out the window , due to amphetamines . So it all came to a head at one show
zone2	, went back to the dressing room , got the bag of amphetamines and made these guys flush them down the toilet . Moon went up like a rocket and hit me with a tambourine . I laid into Moonie , we ended up in a real good punch-up . The roadies pulled us apart , of course , but the damage had been done . Basically , I was thrown out of the band . At that moment , I did n't give a fuck , ' cause if that was gon na be the band , as they had been on amphetamines , was n't worth being in anyway . ( SINGING ) So sad about us He had been this sort of tough guy , boss of the group . Roger puts this band together , and then finds the three dwarfs that he 's brought in to support him suddenly sort of leaving him behind . ( SINGING ) Sad that the news is out now DALTREY : It was the first time in my life that I realized that I loved something else other than
zone2	I 'm being thrown out for being like I was , " then I 'll have to change , " because the band is more important to me than anything . " After about four weeks , they came back and said , " Look , you 're back in the band but you 're on probation . " And one more outburst like that and you 're out . " STAMP : Where 's Pete at ? I have absolutely no idea . Better go and find him . NARRATOR : Four weeks after the blow-up in Copenhagen , The Who returned to the studio to record Pete 's latest creation . When you 're a kid and you pick up a guitar for the first time , you just wan na make that sound .

The fact that he stuttered on it . I mean , if , you know , I thought that was absolutely brilliant . ( SINGING ) I 'm not trying to cause a big sensation Talking ' bout my generation TOWNSHEND : Roger 's got a story about the stutter . And so does Chris Stamp . They 're both well out of order . The stutter came from John Lee Hooker ! It was to do with the pilled-up Mod and the old blues stutter and so . And when I put it on at the first demo , it was partly there . And Chris Stamp said , " What 's that ? " And I said , " I 'm stuttering . " And I think maybe he did n't realize that I meant to stutter . I do n't remember it being on the demo .

I think back to those days , and I just ... I think it was really painful . ( SINGING ) Talking ' bout my generation My generation We had n't really respected the difficulties that Roger had , you know ? It 's wrong for me to say this , but , you know , Keith was a genius . John was
zone2	on the edge of it . You know , Roger was a singer . That was it . I just decided within myself that I would never let them , whatever they did to me , whatever they did , I would , would n't ever react like that again to them . And I became a completely different guy as far as that 's concerned . But I struggled more than anything to find a voice , a real voice for this band .

And we have got for you the most controversial group in England ! Ladies and gentlemen , The Who ! The Who ! The Who ! WOMAN : ( INFRENCH ) Les Who ! MAN : The Who . MAN : The Who ! The Who ! ( SINGING ) One girl was called Jean Marie Another little girl was called Felicity TOWNSHEND : You know , it used to feel to me that the band was doomed . You know , I 'm going off with this fucking horrible band of yobbos . You know , to Germany , and to Sweden , and to ... And with people with whom I had absolutely nothing in common , whatsoever . Nothing . They were at each other a lot . DALTREY : The Who was built on competition . The competition was horrendous
zone2	it got great because it became wonderfully sort of on edge because of that . I mean , you could be watching The Who in , like , ' 66 , ' 67 period when they were gigging . And in the middle of a show , suddenly Pete would , like , get the guitar and whack it around Roger 's ... It was fantastic . You see , everyone was really on edge watching them all the time , you know .

You know , I do n't think there was a lot of magic . What there was was a lot of , you know , brute
zone2	GALLAGHER : Nobody knew what they were doing . Those bands were managed by kids . Do you know what I mean ? Who did n't have a fucking clue what they were doing either . NARRATOR : In March of ' 66 , The Who and their management broke their contract with producer Shel Talmy and began making their own records . STAMP : Very early on , Kit and I realized that if we were n't in control of the recording , and how it went , and what happened , it would just be hopeless . We would lose this gigantic piece of what the destiny of the group was . And so we had to get out of that contract . ( SINGING ) Now it 's a legal matter , baby NARRATOR : Lambert and Stamp started their own company , Track Records . STAMP : I was like the executive producer . Kit was the overall sort of musical director . Day to day , right ? In the studio . ( PICTURESOFLILYPLAYING ) ( SINGING ) I used to wake up in the
zone2	he had these great ideas , but he was n't really technically very good . CURBISHLEY : Kit was the ultimate Barnum and Bailey conman in a lot of ways . He would bluster his way through things , you know , and he had a lot of front and courage in that way . Big fucking pain in the ass , you know , in the studio . But he made it funner . ( SINGINGFALSETTO ) Pictures of Lily ... You know , I can do it , if ... You know , once I get used to sort of ... TOWNSHEND : Just do it with confidence . Just hit it , d' you know ? KIT : Keith , when you hit the very high note , back off a bit because you 're really piercing because of the height of the thing . So you keep jumping on John 's ... John 's usually louder than everyone else anyway . You know ? And if anyone needs backing up , it 's sort of me , you know ? KIT : You cut through everything

Kit had gone into film because he did n't want to be anything to do with music . And suddenly , you know , life rips him back in right in the middle of music , only a different type . ( SINGING ) And I ask you , " Hey mister , have you ever seen " Pictures of Lily ? " I would say to Kit , " No , I really want to write a fucking opera . " You know , " I do n't wan na write rock songs all the time . " And he constantly encouraged me on the basis of his background . ( SINGING ) Her man 's been gone For nearly a year He was due home yesterday But he ai n't here STAMP : It was called the mini-opera , A Quick One While He 's Away , which is an English way of saying , you know , you have a quick fuck
zone2	know what I mean ? That was the story . ( SINGING ) Down your street Your crying is a well-known sound STAMP : It was a big operatic piece told in these sort of six or seven one-minute or two-minute pieces of song . ( SINGING ) We have a remedy You 'll appreciate No need to be so sad He 's only late TOWNSHEND : Kit kept saying to me , " You know , my father , Constant Lambert , would have loved The Who . " So he was very supportive , and that 's how that grew . STAMP : Probably the most important relationship that Kit and Pete had was each other . ( SINGING ) You are forgiven NARRATOR : During the recording session for A Quick One , Lambert introduced the band to one of the first artists signed by the new Track Records . He came to the studio before he became the legendary Jimi Hendrix . And he was just a guitarist in a soul band . ( SINGING ) You are forgiven ( SPOKEN ) You 're forgiven .
zone2	Run , run , run Run , run , run STAMP : We 'd always been looking at the United States because that was sort of like the home of the music that we loved . They just wanted to crack America and you just toured and toured and toured . GOLDSMITH : The Who were a band that represented Britishness and everything that London stood for . NARRATOR : They wore it on their backs for their British invasion . ( SINGING ) You better run , run , run Run , run , run STAMP : We could n't just come over here and make a couple of hit tunes , like pop hits . If they took The Who , they had to take the whole package . NARRATOR : In March of 1967 , they played a nine-day showcase in New York City . Three months later , they went with their new label-mate to Monterey , California . ( SANFRANCISCOPLAYING ) ( SINGING ) If you 're going to San Francisco DALTREY : Monterey was a big one for us . I mean , before
zone2	in my imagination as an enormous event . ENTWISTLE : The worst thing about Monterey was we found out from one of our ex-roadies that Hendrix was gon na steal our act . TOWNSHEND : Jimi was out of his brain on acid and would n't discuss who would go on first . It was n't that we did n't want to follow him . We just wanted to get our act , you know , done first . We were kind of choked up because we were in debt because we smashed our guitars , and then suddenly someone was gon na come along from nowhere and steal it in front of all those people . EMCEE : I 'd like to introduce you to an act who have been passed by slightly in America , but they wo n't be after this . This is The Who , this one . (

zone2	SINGING ) I hope I die before I get old Talking ' bout my generation EDGE : It was a sort of exorcism . The performances just went off into a kind of emotional meltdown , in a sense , which I do n't think anyone had ever seen before . DALTREY : The visual was a ritualistic slaughter of a guitar . But the sound of that slaughter was fucking brilliant . It was the best jazz , it was the best rock and roll . It was something like no one had ever done before . And I still love it to this day . ( AUDIENCEROARING ) TOWNSHEND : We made the house stand up and roar and scream and shout . It 's the first time they 'd ever seen it . They 'd heard about it , but they 'd never seen it happen . And then Hendrix came on , played fairly well , and set his guitar alight , slung it in the air and did it all again . And this time the crowd got up with the same kind of roar
zone2	going on here ? " You know . ( FEEDBACKSCREECHING ) TOWNSHEND : After Monterey Pop , I became very disturbed about acid . Coming back from Monterey , on the plane , he got a really bad trip , and vowed he would n't take any more psychedelic drugs after that . TOWNSHEND : I just started to get really sickened by LSD and acid , and by psychedelia . But I 'd also been inspired by it . There was no question I 'd been inspired . So I was confused by it . Within about two months of that , he was into Meher Baba . I found him through a man called Mike McInnerney . I was talking to Pete about it . I think Pete , like every other rock and roll star , was not having a good time sometimes . TOWNSHEND : And he gave me a book called The God-Man , about this guy called Meher Baba . NARRATOR : He was a Persian born in India who took a vow of silence and kept it for most of his life .
zone2	. McINNERNEY : The very , very simple thing that Baba asked you to do was to love him . There 's a difficulty there , for a start , when you 're in rock and roll , and you 're a performer , and you 're having to do all the stuff that Pete had to do . And yet he chooses to try and make a spiritual journey at the same time . NARRATOR : The year Pete wrote I Ca n't Explain , Meher Baba warned against searching for God in a pill . TOWNSHEND : To the sincere seeker after truth , experimentation with drugs may well open doors , but continued use will lead to madness , death and insanity . And , you know , from what I 've seen , there are very , very , very few exceptions . We were booked on a tour , bottom of the bill , with Herman 's Hermits . You can imagine Herman 's Hermits ' audience , right , with sort of thirteen-year-old middle-class girls . They were introduced to their first piece of
zone2	I want the Magic Bus They just ran . ( CHUCKLES ) They just ran to the back of the hall until Herman came on . ( SINGING ) Too much , the Magic Bus NARRATOR : In Georgia , Moonie discovered fireworks stands . And in Michigan , he celebrated his 21st birthday . BOB PRIDDEN : I do remember a car did end up in the swimming pool . I do n't know whether it was a Lincoln Continental , but a car did end up in the swimming pool and there was a lot of carnage . However much of that is true , you do n't know . I mean , I want it all to be true . You know , you want ... You wan na think that he drove his Rolls Royce into a swimming pool . I mean , he 's Keith Moon , for crying out loud . NARRATOR : The truth is , several cars were damaged as well as several rooms in the hotel . Moonie chipped a tooth running from the law , and The Who was banned

I dig them . ( BICYCLEHORNHONKS ) And this is a ... You know , you got sloppy stagehands around here . ( PLAYINGMYGENERATION ) NARRATOR : On the last gig of the trip , they smashed up their gear for the first time on American television . Keith bribed that sloppy stagehand to overstuff his drum with a dangerous amount of explosives . ENTWISTLE : Moon managed to fulfill the outrageous part of the band and we just let him get on with it and he was outrageous . ( KEITHMOCKCRYING ) (

zone2	a man BARNES : I think obviously Pete wanted a bigger challenge than just a three-minute single , you know . And he wanted to write something much more complex and detailed and layered . ( SINGING ) The kids could n't hurt Jack ... NARRATOR : In four years , The Who had released eight singles in the UK , all of them top-10 hits . Singles drove the market . Once the single happened , you immediately went to an album . As much as we loved the three-minute single , the value was more than just a three-minute single . And it could add up to a lot more . NARRATOR : In December , 1967 , The Who produced a piece of pop art . TOWNSHEND : The only time that I 'd even approached my art-school training was in Who Sell Out . Doing commercials , writing songs about products , and all of that kind of stuff . ( SINGING ) Coca-Cola Things go better with Coke Tell us a little about it , because it 's a very unusual concept . We want
zone2	atmosphere of a pirate radio station , so we 've done a commercial for Jaguar cars , Heinz baked beans . And each one , funnily enough , has opened up a fairly unique opportunity musically , which we would n't have got just through our normal numbers . Keith , play what we did yesterday . Oh , you done , then ? PEEL : Could you do that ? It 'd be very bold of you . (
zone2	music_playing ) Pete realized he was onto something . We knew the album was gon na be the new art form . NARRATOR : Rock music changed the business in 1968 . That year , for the first time , people bought more albums than singles . BARNES : I used to say the ' 60s was like a renaissance , almost . But the one art form or means of communication that was more important than all the others was popular music . RADIO JINGLE : More music , more music , more music , more music ... ( ICANSEEFORMILESPLAYING ) NARRATOR : The Who toured the UK ,

So , I just thought , " Well , what do we do now ? We 're fucked . " ( SINGING ) Here 's a poke at you You 're gon na choke on it , too You 're gon na lose that smile Because all the while I can see for miles and miles I can see for miles and miles TOWNSHEND : I went away and I thought , " I have to save this band .

zone2	of this deaf , dumb and blind boy . The only way he connects with life is he feels the vibes , right ? The vibes are music , right ? That was it . That was like ... You know the screenplay written on the back of a cigarette packet ? That 's what Pete 's idea was . Well , it 's a bit like an opera , but in actual fact , it 's a rock opera . It 's modern music as such . It 's the story of Tommy , the deaf , dumb and blind boy , and his journey through to extreme high levels of consciousness , despite the fact that he 's deaf , dumb and blind . ( PLAYINGI'MFREE ) ( SINGING ) I 'm free I 'm free And freedom tastes of reality It 's all part of reincarnation and levels of consciousness and stuff like this . Meher Baba stuff . Baba might have provided spiritual glue which made sense of the travails this character was going through , and the symbolism , if you like . If you
zone2	, right , it 's that we did n't have a voice . You know , we could n't see . We all had exactly the same experience . You know , when you went to Grandad and you said , " What do you think made the fucking Germans do that ? " He 'd go , " I do n't want to talk about it ! " I do n't want to fucking talk about it ! " You know , kind of , " Fuck off ! " ( 1921PLAYING ) ( SINGING ) You did n't hear it You did n't see it You wo n't say nothing to no one ever in your life You never heard it Oh , how absurd it All seems without any proof TOWNSHEND : We had all these fucking lies we grew up with . Tommy was so much rooted in my childhood story . NARRATOR : Recording began in the fall of ' 68 and lasted six months . Pete , at the time , was writing a song a week , and literally ... Or even a
zone2	studio in the afternoon . And he 'd come in the next day and say , " Here 's the next one , and here 's the next one . " TOWNSHEND : That was when the ideas from the other guys in the band started to come in . ( SINGING ) I 'm your wicked Uncle Ernie I 'm glad you ca n't see or hear me As I fiddle about Fiddle about Fiddle about John Entwistle came up with two really very , very powerful songs about abuse and bullying that I could n't write myself because of my own childhood tenderness on the subject . ( SINGING ) Down with the bedclothes Up with your nightshirt Fiddle about Fiddle about Fiddle about DALTREY : His input should n't be underestimated . I mean , the antagonists , like Uncle Ernie , or initially he is , and Cousin Kevin , are just as important as the hero . It gave the whole thing a balance . Good morning , campers ! ( SINGING ) I 'm your Uncle Ernie And I 'll welcome you to Tommy
zone2	the idea that the temple , the bizarre church that I created , should actually be a British holiday camp . ( SINGING ) The holiday 's forever Ha , ha ! In that moment , all of the elements of it come together . And instead of talking about the trouble that we 'd created a couple of years ago , we were talking about the project , we were talking about what we could do with it . ( SINGING ) You do n't answer my call With even a nod or a wink But you gaze at your own reflection , all right You do n't seem to see me But I think you can see yourself How can the mirror affect you ? INTERVIEWER : Can you explain , in any kind of way , what satisfaction you get from it ? Yeah . Sexual . I 've always loved balls . And to see big , shiny silver balls running around a playground like this , I can get a certain amount of satisfaction building up a score that 's gon na knock everybody else
zone2	do often . ( PLAYINGPINBALLWIZARD ) They came up with this idea of introducing pinball into this bizarre , strange story . It was going all over the place . ( SINGING ) Ever since I was a young boy I 've played the silver ball From Soho down to Brighton I must have played them all But I ai n't seen nothing like him In any amusement hall That deaf , dumb and blind kid Sure plays a mean pinball BARNES : Pete said , " I thought it was rubbish . " He said , " I did n't know whether I should bother finishing it . " And he played it and everyone went quiet until someone said , " That 's the number one . " And he went ( GROANS ) . You know . He could n't see that it was good . ( SINGING ) He 's a pinball wizard There has to be a twist A pinball wizard He 's got such a supple wrist TOWNSHEND : Roger suddenly decided that he would be Tommy . I was supposed to sing Tommy

" ( SINGING ) See me Feel me Touch me Heal me It was only really , though , when we got onstage with Tommy as a complete piece of music that I really found my feet and found The Who voice . ( SINGING ) Touch me Feel me TOWNSHEND : Roger suddenly became this different kind of singer . ( SINGING ) Feel me He 'd never had that quality that he now has , which is of going up to the audience and engaging them and opening his body to them , you know , and that kind of nakedness , instead of being a really tight little kind of , " I 'm a vicious mug , " do n't get in my way " kind of thing . ( SINGING ) Listening to you I get the music Gazing at you I get the heat Following you I climb the mountain I get excitement at your feet It was a role .

The sound systems were n't good . You could n't hear it properly . So we thought , " Well , let 's use opera houses . " ( SINGING ) I had no reason to be over-optimistic STAMP : The group played Tommy truly as an opera , and it was , like , fantastic ' cause you had these ancient , beautiful acoustical places , right ? And this audience hearing their music played this way for the first time . NARRATOR : After 18 months of touring , The Who played one final opera house in New York City , the Metropolitan . ( PLAYINGI'MFREE ) STAMP : They really did n't want us to go in there . They really did n't want to put rock ' n ' roll in the Metropolitan Opera House , right ? The worst snobs turned out to be Americans ,

( SINGING ) Can you Can you hear me ? How can he be saved ? CURBISHLEY : Tommy was huge , and did take the band along on its coattails . Tommy , in its own way , became as big as The Who . ( SINGING ) Waking up on Christmas morning Hours before the winter sun 's ignited They believe in dreams and all they mean Including Heaven 's generosity . Peeping ' round the door to see What parcels are for free in curiosity BARNES : They were developing this high-powered sound for live gigs . And it 's absolutely incredible that you could get that fantastic , full , rich rock sound out of just a guitar , a bass guitar and a drum . ( SINGING ) Listening to you I get the music Gazing at you I get the heat Following you I climb the mountain
zone2	started to feel accepted again in the band during Tommy . TOWNSHEND : Roger became Tommy , became this figure , then it equalized . And then we were unbelievably potent , because we were balanced . It was a marriage , but it was a good marriage . Those were glorious years . ( SINGING ) Right behind you I see the millions On you I see the glory From you I get opinions From you I get the story ( BEHINDBLUEEYESPLAYING ) ( SINGING ) No one knows what it 's like to be the bad man To be the sad man Behind blue eyes I think that Pete has always felt the pressure of being the guy who came up with the ideas . It was such a special gift that he had . ( SINGING ) No one knows what it 's like to be hated To be fated To telling only lies DALTREY : I went through terrible periods where I would want to be getting closer to him but I had to push myself away because he was in a creative thing , and
zone2	, it would be better . But it must have been , for Pete , incredibly lonely . It must have felt , sometimes , that we did n't give a fuck about him . ( SINGING ) I have hours , only lonely My love is vengeance That 's never free It took a terrible toll on him . After Tommy , they said , " Now what are you going to do next , " you know ? NARRATOR : In 1971 , Pete conceived the first interactive rock show . He imagined fans connected to the band , the music , the art . The futuristic performance was to be filmed for a movie and called Lifehouse . The trouble is , with Lifehouse , no one I 've ever met , apart from Pete , ever understood it . At the time , people just thought I was nuts . NARRATOR : Including his mentor . Behind my back , Kit Lambert was telling everybody that I was insane , and that what we were really doing was making a movie of Tommy , and he
zone2	had enough of that . " I mean , we 're gon na be known just for Tommy . It 's bigger than the band . " That was the point at which Kit just exploded the relationship . ( SINGING ) No one knows what it 's like to be the bad man To be the sad man Behind blue eyes NARRATOR : In the spring of ' 71 , Lifehouse was abandoned . ( PLAYINGBABAO'RILEY ) The songs for Lifehouse became the basis of The Who 's most successful album , Who 's Next . The opening track was an anthem named in part for Pete 's spiritual guide , Meher Baba . TOWNSHEND : The nerve of having something open with that huge , long synthesizer intro , which ... Everyone in rock at the time said , " You ca n't have an intro like that " ' cause the radio wo n't play it , " you know . He claims , Pete says , that those riffs are ... That he put Meher Baba 's birth into the computer , and this is what
zone2	, I know you , Pete , you 're ... Right . " You know , " Like hell . " ( SINGING ) Out here in the fields I fight for my meals TOWNSHEND : One of the first messages that I received directly from Meher Baba was that he recognized me , that I was one of his , as it were . And he died two years later , so I never met him . ( SINGING ) Do n't cry Do n't raise your eye It 's only teenage wasteland Sally , take my hand Travel south ' cross land Put out the fire And do n't look past my shoulder NARRATOR : Following the tour for Who 's Next , Pete went to India to visit the tomb of his spiritual guide . Beloved Baba sends his love to you . He is always with you , in you and near you , and he says , " Be happy and not to worry . " In a sense , I was engaged in some kind of sabotage , you know . I was inside
zone2	and had a reputation for being quite rebellious , trying to spread this message of love and peace . ( THEREALMEPLAYING ) ( SINGING ) I went back to the doctor To get another shrink I sit and tell him about my weekend But he never betrays what he thinks Can you see the real me , Doctor ? Doctor ? Can you see the real me , Doctor ? Oh , Doctor ! NARRATOR : In 1973 , Pete crafted a second rock opera . Quadrophenia was set against the rumble of the Mods and Rockers . ( SINGING ) She said , " I know how it feels , son " ' Cause it runs in the family " TOWNSHEND : I wanted Kit to be a part of Quadrophenia , even though it was done and dusted . Chris Stamp said , " Well , he 's in New York , " and he 's got a bit of a problem . He 's become a heroin addict . " DALTREY : After Tommy , the drugs changed . We lost a bit of our vision .
zone2	changed it . Kit and Chris were fighting on a daily basis . They began to fall apart as partners and they began to fall apart as people . It was quite obvious that Kit was now into quite heavy substances . And money was going missing . It was n't a matter of they were trying to screw us . They were just completely of control . We became the problem , right ? So if we were to go , the problem would resolve itself . Now , I 've never understood that . Because , although we may have been fucked up , we could still utter one decent idea once a week from our stupor , you know ? So , I do n't know . It ended . NARRATOR : The band turned to Bill Curbishley to take over management . I looked at the past contracts and what they were achieving as live performers , and I felt that could be dramatically changed . ( SINGING ) Bell boy ! I 've got to get running now Bell boy ! NARRATOR : Having set
zone2	Quadrophenia . ( SINGING ) Carry the bloody baggage out Bell boy ! Always running at someone 's heel NARRATOR : But Pete 's new opera was much more demanding live than Tommy had been . TOWNSHEND : What happened on Quadrophenia was is that I had absolute control , and everybody involved in it was like my puppet . And I think by the very , very end of it , Roger just got sick of it . Roger and Pete had a fight in rehearsals . DALTREY : Pete just got really angry with me . Takes his guitar and hits me over the shoulder with it . So the road crew , they jump on me . I was holding Pete back and the roadies were holding Roger back . And I had n't done anything ! Pete turned around and said , " Yeah ! Let me go ! Let me go ! " So , I thought , fine . I let him go . And he just came at me . He was so drunk . And he walked up to Roger and ...
zone2	punch . Whack . Completely knocked him spark out . His feet left the ground and he hit his head on the stage . And he was unconscious and I thought , " Fuck . " We were all exhausted . It 's a magnificent piece of work , you know , absolutely magnificent . It 's our towering triumph , Quadrophenia . So , in a sense , you know , a little bit of blood spilt on the way is nothing . NARRATOR : As boys , they played dance halls and pubs . ANNOUNCER : Here they are , The Who ! NARRATOR : Less than a decade later , they were headlining stadiums . As The Who developed , so had the business . CURBISHLEY : Just think about the feeling to walk onto a stage , and you 've got 60,000 people out there to see you . Adulation from masses of people is power . And it distorts . The adrenaline that you get from stage , it 's incredibly good when it 's used . But if you ca n't use it ,
zone2	together were a dangerous double act . I was very naive . I did n't realize how much coke they were doing , as well as drinking . And Keith was doing everything else . TOWNSHEND : Mandrakes to go to sleep . He 'd ... Elephant tranquilizer . Anything anybody gave him , he would do it . DALTREY : Who knows what was going on in his brain ? I sometimes feel that he started to believe that he was invincible . " I can take anything . I 'm Keith Moon of The Who . " He was falling down with drug overdoses on the stage during the shows ! I thought if we kept doing what we were doing , you know , Keith was gon na die ! NARRATOR : After the Quadrophenia tour , The Who did not take the stage again for 16 months . DALTREY : We were off the road for long periods of time . And that in itself was destructive to Keith . Keith just used to go out on benders because he did n't have nothing else to
zone2	the trouble is , he 'd end up in a nightclub with him dressed up as a tart or a cavalier . And then 3:00 in the morning , you 're going home , and he 's still that person . ( GIBBERING ) BUTLER : We would just book a hotel in London , and he 'd pull all the Swedish models out of Tramps for four nights and , excuse my French , shag ourselves to death . I used to drive him home , and he was like that in the car . And I 'd just get him outside by the gates , " Oh , dear boy , what a brilliant four days . " Let 's do that again next week . " And , " Yeah , okay . " STAMP : Dougal , he was always there for Keith . You know , he was a good roadie . He was a good driver . He was a good ... He was a good corner man . NARRATOR : Moon 's previous corner man was killed on the job . In 1970
zone2	run over by Keith during an alcohol-fueled scuffle outside a nightclub . Nobody 's really clear on what happened that night , but Keith 's journey of experience with alcohol and drugs basically gathered speed . NARRATOR : In 1974 , Moon moved to Malibu , home of the Southern California surfer music he loved so much . ( SINGING ) Here by the sea and sand Nothing ever goes as planned I just could n't face going home It was just a drag on my own BUTLER : He wanted to get into movies . You know , people say , " I make a great movie star . " At the end it became too much . I made a phone call to Bill Curbishley , and I said , " Look , I 'm leaving ' cause I ca n't do it anymore . " But I did say to Bill , " Get him home as soon as possible " ' cause the way he 's carrying on , he 's not gon na be here much longer . " ( SINGING ) Nothing is planned
zone2	, Tommy was immortalized on film . But not by Kit Lambert . Director Ken Russell wrote a new script for the rock opera . GALLAGHER : The film is appalling , right ? It 's dreadful . And everybody in it really should question their fucking judgment , particularly Eric Clapton . Bit pants . Little bit pants . TOWNSHEND : I 've always been a fan of Ken 's , both as a person and as a visionary , and I love it . I just love it . NARRATOR : Tommy spent 14 weeks atop the British box office , and garnered three Academy Award nominations . As his most popular creation took another lap around the world , Pete went to work on a new album . TOWNSHEND : I would think , " I ca n't go through that again . " " I just ca n't go through it again . " I ca n't come up with some great idea " and push it through . I do n't have the arrogance , I do n't have the ... " I do n't
zone2	SINGING ) It 's clear to all my friends that I habitually lie I just bring them down TOWNSHEND : Where we saw our future was in movies . We 'd already done Tommy , we 'd managed to get a foothold in Shepperton Studios , we thought that we were gon na be about movies . NARRATOR : Manager Bill Curbishley would strike a deal to produce the film of Quadrophenia . As they pursued the new popular art form , a new generation began taking over music . GOLDSMITH : Punk , I hated it . And I could n't see the point of spitting and all that crap . It was the revolution of the uglies . NARRATOR : And the uglies loved The Who . ( SINGING ) You think that we look pretty good together You know , they come under that category a little bit as big stars that were n't approachable . ( SINGING ) A substitute for another guy TOWNSHEND : We were frightened . It was like the French Revolution . It could have ended up with , you know ,
zone2	in public . ( SINGING ) I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth Me and Cookie went down to Speakeasy , which was an after-hours place in London . And Townshend was in there , already drunk . TOWNSHEND : Went screaming after Jones and Cook and kind of going , you know , " If you wan na take over , fucking take over . " Just fucking get on with it ! " You know , " Good fucking luck ! " STEVE JONES : I think we might 've been all a bit tipsy , but he was hammered . And he was going up to people saying , " Who are you ? Who are you ? " To everyone . NARRATOR : In 1977 , Keith returned to England . Pete had been writing new material . ( SINGING ) Who are you ? Who , who ? Who , who ? Who are you ? Who the fuck are you ? NARRATOR : That December , they filmed a performance for the band 's latest project , a documentary film .
zone2	are you ? Who are you ? NARRATOR : It was their first time back onstage in more than a year . ( SINGING ) Oh , tell me who are you ? Who are you ? I woke up in a Soho doorway A policeman knew my name He goes , " You can go home tonight " If you can get up and walk away " I staggered back to the Underground And the breeze blew back my hair I remember throwing punches around And preaching from my chair Who are you ? TOWNSHEND : Unfortunately , the band did n't play as well , but we all , I think all of us , had such a good time together . But we were all wrecks by then , you know , so it 's kind of like ... ( SINGING ) Who are you ? Who , who ? Who , who ? I really want to know Who are you ? Who , who ? Who , who ? Oh , who the fuck are you ? NARRATOR : In the spring of 1978 ,
zone2	in three years . That summer , Moon began taking prescription medicine to try to curb his drinking . TOWNSHEND : Keith did that thing ... I said , " Now come on , come on . Give it a real go . " And he 'd start to try and play and , " I ca n't , I ca n't . " I 'd say , " Come on , try again , " and he 'd ... ( IMITATESMOONSIGHING ) And in the end he threw down his sticks , and he went , " I 'm still ... " Having a bad day , " but I 'm still the best fucking " Keith Moon type " drummer in the world ! " ( SINGING ) Who are you ? Who , who ? Who , who ? I really want to know NARRATOR : Who Are You was released August 18 , 1978 . ( SINGING ) I really want to know Who are you ? Who ? I really want to know I really want to know Come on , tell me Who are
zone2	NEWSCASTER : He was found unconscious in a London flat this morning . NEWSCASTER 2 : A doctor was called , who pronounced Moon dead . NEWSCASTER 3 : He was found dead by his girlfriend early today . He was 32 . It was a silly mistake that made him take a handful of Heminevrin and it disables the esophagus and , you know , he could n't throw up , and ... He just always took pills in handfuls . It was just a habit that he had . CURBISHLEY : He was never gon na grow old gracefully . I do n't think he was destined to make old bones . I suppose he was designed in such a way to be remembered as he was . It is the end of an era . We 're gon na try and go on , but the one thing that everyone must understand , it will never , ever be the same . That died . But it was very strange ' cause there 's something underneath determined not to let the one thing that we 'd all
zone2	not to let it die . ( SINGING ) Long live rock ! I need it every night Long live rock ! Come on and join the line Long live rock ! Be it dead or alive NARRATOR : Less than eight months after Moonie 's death , The Who returned to the stage with keyboard player Rabbit Bundrick and drummer Kenney Jones . Kenney Jones was a good mate from The Small Faces . And we 'd always admired him as a drummer , and we liked him as a guy . Anything can change , especially , you know , with Pete . So , you just go with it and you got to know when to go with it . STAMP : I went to see The Who for the first time without Keith . And I 'm standing at the side of the stage and Pete goes off onto some sort of freestyle sort of riff , you know , on his guitar . And he turns to Keith . Because he 's gone as far as he can go . So he turns to Keith
zone2	on the stage when I ... I 'm taken aback , because I look and expect him to be there . This is because it is like a marriage . ( SINGING ) Long live rock ! Come on and join the line A real sense of connection and of life wanting to kind of go on like a wheel , and thinking , " Well , everything that goes comes back again . " And the thing is is that with people , it does n't work like that . They do n't come back again . Let 's have the biggest hand of the night for Mr . Kenney Jones , our new drummer . Hey ! (
zone2	audience_clapping ) Did n't know what I was letting myself in for , really , to be honest . But there you go . What happened to me was I started to drift into substances , you know . Pete 's addiction in 1979 was perhaps a reflection of , I think , the guilt that both , I 'm sure Pete felt , and I , ' cause I
zone2	enough to save Keith . You know , even I started to do things I 'd never done before . You know , I felt very miserable for a long time . JONES : Roger obviously was missing Moonie . Not just onstage , but in many other ways . And I think it really got to him a bit . I did n't bank on the emotional elements , you know . NARRATOR : During Kenney 's first tour , The Who played through the deadliest rock concert in US history . Cincinnati was an emotionally devastating situation . The band were like 20 minutes into their show . The co-promoter came to me and he said , " We got a problem up on the plaza level . " What happened is there was only one door to get through , and a staircase to go down . So they all rushed . CURBISHLEY : And those kids that fell got trampled on . The band were unaware of what was happening until they finished the show . We had to go back to America a couple of
zone2	Do you feel responsible for the people that died ? " You know . It still haunts me to this day . I ca n't tell you how I felt about the parents of those kids . Their kids have gone off to a concert , and they do n't come home . We all bear scars . But you do n't live without having that map of life somewhere on your face . ( PLAYINGEMINENCEFRONT ) NARRATOR : They released two albums in two years , Face Dances in ' 81 and It 's Hard in ' 82 , only to be savaged by some fans and critics . TOWNSHEND : When you read the newspapers and the reviews , it 's like , " This album is the worst thing that 's ever happened in the history of rock and roll . " You know , " Townsend has gone mad and is masturbating in public . " You know . " They may as well crawl away and die . " ( SINGING ) Sun shines People forget The spray flies as the speedboat glides People forget
zone2	of art died of a brain hemorrhage in 1981 . Kit Lambert was 45 . I did n't have an answer . I could n't work out what to do that would return the band to its halcyon years . ( SINGING ) ... as the skier tracks People forget They forget they 're hiding It 's an eminence front DALTREY : What makes The Who special is that it 's not even what 's written . It 's the bits that you do n't know are going to happen . And they come of thin air . Some nights it makes it , some nights it does n't . But the nights that it makes it , they were ... That was the trouble with Kenney . Those nights became fewer and fewer . CURBISHLEY : It was Roger who pushed to get him of the band . He did n't think he was right for The Who . There is no right drummer for The Who . There will be never be the right drummer for The Who . It will only be Keith . But there you
zone2	an eminence front It 's a put-on NARRATOR : In 1983 , Pete officially dissolved the band , just months before Tommy was reissued on a new format , the compact disc . ( SINGING ) Bullshit ! Bullshit Yeah , yeah , yeah We 've just reached the end , you know ? That 's the way I feel about it . I do n't know why . Bye-bye ! I ca n't wait to get out . ( SINGING ) Got to dress to kill Dress yourself to kill DALTREY : You 've been traveling on this thing that 's going a million miles an hour , and all of a sudden it comes to a complete , dead stop . And it 's incredibly difficult to adjust , because we have n't lived normal lives . It 's as though the world stops . TOWNSHEND : At the time I was fairly convinced that I would do better as a solo artist . I did a few songs . It was a pragmatic decision . Whether it was the right or the wrong decision , I had
zone2	continued to work , I think I would 've been a casualty . I blamed rock and roll . And of course , after three or four years being out of front-line rock and roll , I realized I was just as sick , just as mad and , you know , just as overworked . You know , so ... It was me that was the problem . NARRATOR : The Who returned to the stage on only two occasions over the next 13 years : A 20-minute set at Live Aid , and an all-star tour for the twentieth anniversary of Tommy . That 's the weird thing , it 's like soldiers that used to go out to war and come back and just could n't identify with , like , normal life anymore . When you come home , it 's like , I ca n't take this , like , normal existence . BOB PRIDDEN : John lived for gigging . He went out with his solo bands , and ... And it cost him ! He financed it . He did n't make any
zone2	deeply in debt . I do n't think it 's any secret that he was . Those years when The Who were n't working , he continued to spend and live the lifestyle . And I went to Pete and said , you know , " This is the only way he 's gon na " ever get a chance to dig himself out of the hole " is to get ... If you would get The Who back together . " ( SINGING ) Why should I care ? Why should I care ? I would never hesitate to consider , at least , you know , that it might be something to do , because I would just think , " Well , without him , I would n't even be here . " NARRATOR : Pete agreed to tour Quadrophenia in 1996 . The band brought in Ringo Starr 's son , Zak Starkey , on drums . As soon as we played those songs , Moonie was alive again . ( SINGING ) Girls of 15 Sexually knowing The ushers are sniffing Eau-de-cologning At the end
zone2	three million dollars and they were gone overnight . NARRATOR : With John in financial trouble , they agreed to yet another reunion in 1999 with just their basic lineup . ( SINGING ) I 've got a feeling inside Ca n't explain It 's a certain kind Ca n't explain TOWNSHEND : John never seemed to go into depression . As long as there was a nice big wardrobe with 15 pairs of shoes in it and the obligatory serially monogamous girlfriend along , he was happy . NARRATOR : Under the continued leadership of manager Bill Curbishley , the band agreed to a series of live shows . ( SINGING ) I ca n't explain I think it 's love Try to say it to you When I feel blue But I ca n't explain Something happened then . Pete became inspired again . It was like the wheel was back on the barrow . TOWNSHEND : We were just celebrating the old music . I 'd felt like we should just accept that , you know , that we had these great songs and that , personally
zone2	them . ( SINGING ) I said , I ca n't explain DALTREY : Thank you very much . We are honored to be here . VEDDER : Music is an art form . That art form includes rhythm , meaning and communication . I 've met people from different walks of life , and they 've all been touched in such a unique and pure way . They really feel this deep connection . So now you 've got , for me , the greatest art form that ever existed . ( **26;3323;TOOLONG ) ( SINGING ) We 'll be fighting in the streets With our children at our feet And the morals that they worship will be gone And the men who spurred us on CURBISHLEY : When we got that call about the concert for New York , America meant so much to The Who , we had to go .

EDGE : I was sitting with Bono . We just ... The two of us could not believe it . Just the way they just owned that event , you know ? Over the TV . ( SINGING ) There 's nothing in the streets Looks any different to me And the slogans are replaced by the by Just so much more powerful live than anyone else that was on the bill that night . That show in New York , that could be one of the best illustrations of the power of music . Yeah ! ( SINGING ) Do n't you get fooled Do n't you get fooled again Never ! No , no , no , no ! The sentiments to those songs , if I could explain it to you , right , it would be too easy to explain it to you . It 's
zone2	you know , and mean as much to people 40 years later than they did when they were written . You know , that 's phenomenal . And that something you ca n't put into words . It 's just magic , man . CURBISHLEY : They were back , in a big , big way . Back as a four-piece . Back on the road . It was like a rebirth again . We had to go back and play there . We had a contract to play Las Vegas . I flew out to Las Vegas . The next morning , got a call from my tour manager saying they could n't wake John up . BUTLER : Let 's put something into a little bit of perspective . John was one of the best bass players in the world . John died at the age of nearly 60 , with a woman in bed , after snorting cocaine . Now , you think , " Hold on , John . " You should have done this in the ' 70s . Not now . " The coroner
zone2	clear . He should n't have been there . He should n't have been doing what he was doing , and it was crazy . It 's kind of what he chose to do . That 's just how he was . I did have a chuckle . I mean , if he was gon na go , he could n't have gone in a better way , really . On tour , doing all the things he ... And being around the things that he loved best , you know . I think all of us want to die onstage . I mean , none of us wan na be just written off . GALLAGHER : It gets more difficult as you get older . How do I say this ? Let 's say for argument 's sake , you 're a 58-year-old guy who 's been in a band from the ' 60s , right ? It 's fucking frowned upon in this country . It 's like , " God , you fucking idiot . " What are you doing , silly old man ? " We
zone2	of lads like that . I do n't know why it is , you know ? We should keep going until it 's over . We should n't stop . ( SINGING ) They made my dream come true They made my dream come true Pete rang me back and said " I want to continue with this tour . " If we 'd have split up and gone our own ways the next day , I think we would have probably found it very difficult to get back together on a stage . NARRATOR : The Who performed four days later at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles . Pino Palladino was the band 's first choice to fill in on bass . Listen , we know this ... For some of the fans that have followed us for many years , this is gon na be very difficult . And we understand . We 're not pretending that nothing 's happened , as Roger said earlier on . And it is difficult . I can tell you with my hand on my heart , that when I did
zone2	wanted to die . I just wanted to die . ( SINGING ) This song is over I 'm left with only tears I must remember Even if it takes a million years CURBISHLEY : If Moon was predictable , then John was unnecessary . A great , great loss . Great loss , John . I miss him so much , I ca n't tell you . TOWNSHEND : What 's actually now happened , a further gift that John 's death has given me , is to enjoy an acutely emphatic relationship with Roger . You know , we experienced John 's death . He saw me get arrested for , you know , a child pornography allegation ... ( SINGING ) How dare you wear a robe to preside ? How dare you cover your head to hide Your face from God ? He was vilified . He was dragged across the fucking national papers in a scurrilous way , you know . And after months of investigation , they established that there was nothing that he could be charged with . In the end , nobody
zone2	But Roger Daltrey , his partner , he went to bat for him and he was under a lot of pressure , Roger . ( SINGING ) How dare you ? Do you think I 'll quietly go ? You are much braver than you know For I ca n't die Roger is the voice of The Who . And when you 're growing up , you just think that he wrote all those things and he 's singing them from his heart , and ... And then you realize it was coming from this guy , Pete . That 's when I started to realize there was something deeper going on here . They 're two incredibly strong forces and they 've relied on each other for years . Since John died , we 're probably musically more together . I 'm sure spiritually we are . ( SINGING ) Will you have some tea At the theater with me ? We did it all Did n't we ? Jumped every wall TOWNSHEND : I think Roger is the best , you know , interpreter of my work that
zone2	Unraveled codes Ingeniously What 's very interesting about what Roger and I are left with is that we have a very pure relationship . ( SINGING ) So seamlessly We made it work DALTREY : I recognize his genius and I love him dearly . He 's like a brother . You know , that 's love . Even though on the outside , and when you read things about what we did in the past and how many fights we used to have , you think , " These guys used to hate each other . " Did we fuck ? " You know ? Well , I did n't , anyway . I loved him . ( SINGING ) A great dream derailed TOWNSHEND : He 's my friend , I love him , and I 'm standing by him , and he stands by me . We can say what we like about each other now . You know , it 's not easy for either of us , because we 're so unbelievably unalike . But , you know , we 're kind of all we
zone2	me All of us sad It is really not important whether I am , at the time , getting on with Pete or he 's getting on with me . It does n't matter . All that matters is what we create on the stage . That two hours of music , that night , and as long as that is still moving people and sending people out with a buzz , then we 're succeeding . ( SINGING ) Will you have some tea At the theater with me ? ( CROWDCHEERINGLOUDLY ) One , two , one , two , three ...

You were there during the commission of a crime
zone2	law , you might as well have shot them yourself . Ben , they 're moving real fast on this . You need to prepare yourself . And then Wendy told Mrs . Jamison , so I hit her in the face . You know that was wrong , do n't you ? Yeah , but she deserved it . She broke a promise . Yeah , but no more hitting . No matter what , okay ? Okay . Daddy , when are you gon na come back home ? You know I love you and your mommy more than anything else in the world , right ? Yeah . Well ... . I did something real bad . Come on , take your walk . Something I did n't mean to do .

zone2	Angel ? Rain 's gon na start up again . Jump in . I 'll give you a ride . Constant rain showers this time of year . Like clockwork . Sun , rain , sun , rain . I 'm assuming you 're the new groundskeeper ? Yeah . Well , how do you like it so far ? What 's happening to me ? It 's quiet . Quiet is why the order came here . It 's good for priests . Not to mention the patients . Groundskeeper 's office is at the end of the main hall . Let me park , and I 'll give you the tour . You have been given a second chance . I wan na go home . Tapalamaho is what the Indians called this plateau . They 'd come here to pray . Then , 200 years ago , the order came built this place and started praying too . I guess if it 's good enough for the Indians , it 's good enough for priests . Chapel 's off the east wing . I 'll show it
zone2	every month . The chapel itself , once a week . Fridays are good . The last groundskeeper left things in a bit of a mess . Unexpected departure . The chapel was the first building put up , and all the pipes run from it . Most plumbing problems will start here . Oh , it 's the old priest rectory . It 's closed up . Water damage . This tunnel connects all five buildings . Its not used for much anymore . But I think the first priests hid here when the natives got restless . There 's no going back , Ben . If you need help , use Robbie . Working on the grounds is good therapy for him . He likes to be needed . Well , she 's all yours . How are you adjusting ? It can be difficult at first . It becomes easier . Do you remember my name ? Avery . Where am I ? This is Oregon . I 'm alive . What does that make you , then ? A guide . I do n't want any
zone2	wife and my daughter . Can I please leave ? You 've made a selfish choice , Ben . Men died that day . There 's a price to pay . You can not see them again in this life . It was an accident . It was a horrible accident . Ben , listen to me . The rules are simple . This is a second chance . Now , if you deny it you 've damned yourself to an eternity without Lisa and Katie . Outside of this town , the only thing waiting for you is death . Accept this new life . What if I ca n't ? You will . Only a fool spits in the face of God . I 'm not crazy . People think just because you 're here means you 're crazy . I did high school in Portland . I did n't like it . I wanted to go to college after but my dad wanted me to join the Army . He thought it would make me tough . Do you like your dad ? Yeah . He live
zone2	. That 's sad . People are watching us . I do n't know who they are . They 're always watching . Do you think I 'm crazy ? No . I do n't think you 're crazy . Watch his hand . Why did you stop me ? Why did you stop me ? Why did you stop me ? Why 'd you do it , Ben ? PGE operator . Can I help you ? Yes , I need a number , please . Lisa Garvey in Dallas , Texas . Hold on , please . I 'm sorry , sir . There is no such listing . Priest Andari . They 're copies of his most famous works . Hi . I 'm Julie Ingram . I 'm one of the counselors here . You are the new groundskeeper ? Ben . They were etched by the Mount 's founding priest , Isaac Fowler . They 've faded a bit , but this is a nice place to think . I 'll come back later . No . No , it 's okay . I 'm
zone2	Why did you stop me ? It was an accident . There are no accidents . There are only thing things we do and what those things do to other people . William . Let him go . You 're just like me . This is Building Number 5 . It 's where we keep patients who ca n't be controlled . It 's best to steer clear of it . You new ? Around here , I mean . Yeah . There 's not a lot to do in Dundee , but it 's an all right place . Can I get you anything else ? I 'll just take the check . Go away . Get out of here . Go home , dog . You 're not getting in here . Go home . People have been drawing with charcoal for thousands of years . There are these caves in France Lascaux , I think where they found these from the Stone Age all done in charcoal . Deer , bison , horses . Even one of you . Hi . I 'm Lisa Madison , and
zone2	Powder Springs area for over a year now . I know the area and the people like the back of my hand . Why ? Because I live here with my daughter . This is my house and my dream . RealTops made it possible for me and I can make it possible for you . Bye . So , what 's in Texas ? Home . Bus will be along in about an hour . This bus is not for you , Ben . You do n't wan na be on it . You need to let go . Stop thinking about what you had . Just accept what you were given . A new home , a job . A chance to make what you did right . I have to be with my wife and my daughter . They need me . Ben , look at me . Death is here . Close to you . It 's what you hear in the forest when you 're all alone . Now , you cheated him once . You wo n't cheat him a second time . This
zone2	and you 'll never see your family again . Make the right choice while you still can . Thank you . Ben ? Hi . Hi . I did n't see you today . I was cleaning the chapel . It 's beautiful inside . Quiet . Quiet guy who likes quiet places . Shocking . Hey , what are you doing for dinner ? You still smoke ? Cigarette burn between your fingers , right ? Yeah . I quit a few years back . I fell asleep while smoking . - Could 've burned your house down . - That 's why I quit . So you been in Dundee long ? No , not long . I 'm actually from San Diego . And you 're a psychiatrist . And your job brought you here . Partly . And then there was the train wreck of a relationship that I was in . I think I needed to escape that . - Changing your whole life around . - Yeah . That must have been tough . No . Not really . I figured I was probably
zone2	I was right . It looks like they 're kicking us out . Need a ride ? No , thanks . I 'm just down the road . Okay . I 'll see you in the morning . This bus is not for you , Ben . What did we do ? What 's the symbol mean ? I killed a man . Shot him . And I did it for no other reason than he was home . That 's how I got here . What does it mean ? The symbol on your wrist , the one that you carved into the trail . How could I have done that ? I saw you out , William . No one can get out . Not even you have that key . What does it mean ? You should know . You 're just like me . They 're watching again . Nobody 's watching , Robbie . I see them . There 's nobody . Do you understand that ? That 's why they keep you here , Robbie . It 's because you act crazy and you
zone2	're here too , Ben . I did n't mean to sneak up on you . I 'm picking up some furniture in Silverton . I could use a hand . Oh , rain clouds . I suspect it 's gon na start up again . People like Robbie ... . People with psychological issues , do they even know it ? No , not usually . The hardest part of treatment is convincing them they 're ill . What 's wrong with Robbie ? Robbie killed his father . Stabbed him 40 times with a hunting knife , then burnt the house down . - Robbie did that ? - Yup . His father was a bad man . Robbie thinks people are watching him . Yup . Well , we all create fictions to deal with our pain . The only thing watching Robbie is his guilt . I 'll be right back . I just want to say goodbye to Carl . It looks like poison ivy , maybe an allergic reaction . How 's everything else ? You look tired . I have n't been sleeping
zone2	the woods before . At night , you get woken up . You hear things . Well , sometimes I even see things . Nothing 's out there . You know , it 's just the wind . Yeah , I know . I 'll give you some prescription-strength hydrocortisone . It 'll bring the swelling down . Hey . Hi . I was gon na take a walk down Plowers ' trail after work . You wan na come along ? Oh , come on , dog , stop digging . I hope you like the rain . It 's on its way . Can my dog come along ? What 's his name ? Dog . You named your dog Dog ? Well , I just found him . Yes , bring Dog . But we 're giving him a real name on the walk . All right . What about Bill ? Bill ? What kind of name is Bill for a dog ? It 's better than Dog . Not by much . So tell me something about you . Like what ? I do n't
zone2	I have n't thought about that one . Hey , I wan na show you something . Over here . Come on , Dog . It 's beautiful . I know . Do you come here a lot ? Yeah , quite a bit . To think . About ? Just things I 'm trying to let go of . There 's a struggle . How do you live if you 're ruled by your past ? But how do you let go of a past that made you ? You still have n't told me anything about yourself . I like the name Dog for a dog . Maybe it 's not such a bad name . Hey , man . Kitchen guys wanted me to let you know the disposal line 's backed up . Sorry , Ben . Sorry . - We thought you were William . - He found a way out . You need a hand finding him ? No , no , he 's dangerous . We 'll see you tomorrow . Come on . I wonder how far down it is . Everybody
zone2	always worry . That 's what they do . I kept thinking they 'd let me go once I got better if I ... . If I made better choices . I have a son in the world . I do n't see him . Yeah , me too . I mean , I have a daughter . We 're far apart . My boy , he ... . Well , he probably does n't even remember me by now . They made me this way . They gave me drugs . Put me in that building because I would n't do what they wanted . I would n't be who they wanted me to be . Let 's go back . If you run , they 're just gon na follow you . I know . But they ca n't follow me to heaven . No . No . Give me a hand . Are you okay ? Have you ever had this happen before ? No . Never a suicide . He wanted to go home . Mount Angel was his home . I guess he just could
zone2	medicine is to accept our lives as they are . Come on . I 'll walk you home . Hi . Hi . I heard what happened with William . I just wanted to make sure you 're all right . Yeah , I 'm all right . Do you need anything ? Are you hungry ? I can make us something to eat . Okay . Yeah , that 'd be great . This beer is good . I mean , I 'm not a big beer girl , but there 's actually beer that 's called : " Stone Brew Nation " ? What is that ? But it 's good . Are you happy here ? It's-- It 's a little strange . I do n't know . Do you find it odd ? Odd ? No . Dundee is perfectly , boringly small-town normal . - I like the people , though . - Yes , the people are very nice . - Yeah . - Decent . Yeah , they just - - You know , they 're hard working . Normal . I 'm
zone2	- No , it 's okay . I should leave . Good boy , Dog . Damn it . Sorry , Dog . I 'll get it down for you later . Hey , Robbie . Hey , Ben . No clouds out tonight . No . How many you up to ? Four thousand two hundred and twenty-one . Listen , Robbie . I got ta ask you something . - Remember - - ? - You want a Mountain Dew ? Thank you . You 're welcome . Robbie . The people that you said are watching who are they ? I do n't know . Do they watch me ? Yes . There 's nothing that we can do to beat death . Dog , get in the house . Dog , come on . Inside . Leave me alone ! Leave me alone ! Leave me alone ! Leave me alone ! Leave me alone ! Leave me alone ! I just wan na go home . I miss you . I 'm sorry . I know . I just wan na come home . Then
zone2	go , Dog . Come on . Dog . Dog ? Dog ! Dog ! How 's your head ? You took a nasty fall . What am I doing here ? You were running through the woods out of control . I could n't let you leave . What do you mean , you could n't let me leave ? What 's this ? Patient folder . Your patient folder . You 've been with us since shortly after the accident . What accident ? We all create fictions to hide our pain . No . No , they 're not dead . This is a lie . Three years ago , you fell asleep smoking . There was a fire . You got out . But Katie and Lisa did n't . You blamed yourself . You could n't handle the guilt . You disappeared after several months . Then you were arrested burglarizing an empty warehouse in Dallas . You were placed in care and you came here shortly after to continue treatment . I 'm not a patient . I work here . I 'm a
zone2	both enjoy it . Right , and I have a cabin on Plowers ' trail . I have a dog . The old smith cabin ? It 's been empty for three years . There 's no dog , Ben . We do n't allow animals at the Mount . You 're lying to me . Why are you lying to me , Ezra ? They 're not dead . I 'm gon na prove it to you . Hi , I 'm Lisa Madison , and I 've been selling homes in the Marietta , Powder Springs area for over a year now . I know the area and the people because I live in Marietta with my daughter . They made my dream a reality . RealTops made it all possible for me . - They can make it possible -- - Who 's that , Ben ? - Bye . - I do n't ... . I do n't know . Come on , it 's late . Let 's walk you to your room . We 'll talk more in the morning . Ben ! Do
zone2	, let 's go . Let 's go . Hey . Hey ! Let me out ! Ezra , let me out ! Ezra , let me out ! Let me out ! No , no . Ezra ! No , no ! Thank you . Ben , hi . - Hi . - You doing better ? I was hoping you were n't still mad at me . About what ? What happened at the cabin . I 'm sorry , I do n't remember any cabin . Ben ? Are you okay ? I was talking to a man . An angel . And he warned me that if I did n't accept my life here then I would die . That death would find me . And ... . A couple of times , I would have sworn that I saw a demon or something . And I would have tried to leave sooner but I was afraid . - Those were all hallucinations ? - Yeah . Yeah , the angel is a subconscious representation of your desire to heal . The angel was asking you
zone2	your mind struggled , because to heal it would also mean letting go of Lisa and Katie . Yeah . So you manifested fears and images of death to keep you here . I wan na start over . I wan na forget . You do n't have to forget . You just have to move on . I wan na be outside working the grounds again . All right . We 'll move you back to your old room , away from Building Number 5 . Do you sleep with the light on ? Light on ? Yeah . I ca n't sleep in the dark . I need that light on . If not , I 'm afraid that when I wake , everything will be gone and it 'll only be me left in the world . Does that sound crazy ? No . It does n't sound crazy . Do you like it here , Ben ? I 'm okay with it . I like it here . It 's better than my old life . That 's great , Robbie . Ben . No one
zone2	friend . That 's because you are my friend . My best friend . Are you sure you want something with shepherd in it ? - Positive . - Well , we have one . Small thing , really . Well-mannered . How long has this dog been here ? Not long . About a week . You 're just like me . What happened ? - He 's disappeared . - Not for long . He 'll turn up . Find Ben . It 's him . Okay , go in . Ben , I stopped by your room . You were n't there . I was worried . Ben ? Ben 's not here . He went home . Ben . What are you doing here ? Take it easy , Ben . Take it easy . Ben , take it easy . Since when do angels bleed ? Ben , listen to me . Ben , listen to me . Calm down . Ben . Relax . Ben , calm down . So it never happened ? - lt never happened ? - No . Then they
zone2	doing . - No ! - Ben . You lied to me . Why did you do this ? Rehabilitation , Ben . What if instead of killing people , we could change them by providing them with new lives , environments ? - lnsane . - No . It all starts in the mind . What people do , why they do it the selfish choices , it 's all in here . In our heads . What if we could fix human beings , Ben ? Fix them before they 've even made those mistakes . Then they would n't be human . - No , no , you do n't understand . - Do n't you move . I understand . I understand . You tried to convince me I was crazy , Ezra . You wanted me to believe that if I left , I 'd die . That bus never crashed . You told me my family was dead . You 're not rehabilitating people , Ezra . You 're torturing them . I saved your life , Ben . Like you saved William 's
zone2	. You pumped him full of drugs . - You did the same thing to me . - The drugs just loosened the anxiety . You made him nuts . He was seeing things . I was seeing things . - He made a choice . - He had no choice . You killed him , Ezra . You may as well pushed him off that cliff yourself . You 'd be buried , Ben . Dead . Mud and worms . We gave William a second chance at life . - The same chance we gave you . - I did n't ask for one . Ca n't let you leave , Ben . I 'm not so sure you can stop me . I found your files , Ezra . I made a copy . - Where 's the hard drive ? - Hidden , somewhere safe . And it 'll stay that way as long as I make it home . Otherwise , it will go to every paper in the country . Now I 'm gon na go home , Ezra . And the only way
zone2	Kill you ? Ben , as far as the world is concerned you 're already dead . Ben . What we 're doing , we 're doing for the right reasons . Mommy , I had a dream about Daddy . He lived in the woods with big trees and stuff . I went to see him , but he was sad . I told him about the bird . What bird , honey ? The jaybird . The bird that did n't die . Maybe Daddy 's like the jaybird . Maybe someday he 's gon na come back too . Do n't think that way , honey . Do n't think that Daddy ever left . Because he did n't . He 's still here with us . I know he is . Mommy , what 's the greatest thing you ever saw ? I do n't think I 've seen it yet , baby .

zone2	Beams . Plaster . Nothing . It is with deep sadness and regret that I have to advise you that two hijacked planes have crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center from what remains of the World Trade Center for 9:00 . One airplane crashed into World Trade Center Two . About 15 minutes later , an airplane crashed into the second one . About an hour later , both of them collapsed . Associated Press is reporting that a plane or helicopter crashed at the Pentagon , and the Pentagon is being evacuated . Whether that fire is in the building itself or outside , we have not yet confirmed . This is a live picture of the Pentagon and an Associated Press reporter says he could see the tail of a large airliner as it plowed into the Pentagon . And that fire there in Washington continues to burn . Bastards ! ... just a few minutes after that , it was n't very long , you will see , it happened again . The second tower came tumbling down . That was the first
zone2	collapse of the second tower . And so now , as we stand here , both towers ... The tops of both towers are gone . Allison , let 's sit outside . Behind somewhere that plume of smoke that continues to rise over the ... He 's probably still at the bus terminal . What is left of those buildings , we can not tell you . We can not tell you . - Allison . - Jerry . Al , I 'm looking at the Tunnel . There 's no one there . No Port Authorities there . Al , I do n't ... I guess they got called in . Can you get someone to drive you ? - Allison ? - Yeah , yeah , yeah . Okay , I 'll see you at home in half an hour . I 'll call Mom and Dad . Okay . We got to pick up Bianca . Both towers came down , trapping thousands and thousands of people inside . We do not know the numbers yet , but we do know thousands of people work inside
zone2	There are reports that hundreds and hundreds of fire and police and rescue crews are missing or unaccounted for . Officials seem simply stunned by the scale of the losses ... They keep showing the same thing over and over and over . Jay 's there . They must have called in every company in the city . He would have been there early . Yeah , John , too , probably . He knows those buildings so well . They 've seen something no one has ever seen before . One man who came by said he had seen this building come down . It looked as though it was imploding . This was complete chaos and utter hell that has come to Lower Manhattan . Oh , my God . Judy . Listen to me . Listen to me . Look . They evacuated those buildings . All right ? I 'm sure most everybody got out . They 're fine . In the ' 93 attack , John said everybody got out real quick . God . In ' 93 , the buildings did n't fall down
zone2	call everybody and cancel . A Den Mothers meeting right now sounds pretty dumb , right ? I keep looking for John . There 's so many policemen running around . Maybe I 'll see him . - Judy . - Yeah ? Judy ... - They 're here to tell us they 're dead . - No . No , they 're not . They 're not . - Hey , Judy . Jay ... - No . No . Look , we know he 's alive . All right ? They know where he is . They 're communicating with him . He 's alive ? Yes . Yeah , we 're gon na go down there now and help out . - Oh , thank God . - Yes ! There you go . - Thank God . Oh , my God . - There you go . Oh , that 's good . - That 's good . - Thank you , God . PAPD . 8-13 . Officers Jimeno and McLoughlin . We 're trapped near the FE Five vestibule . Will you please work
zone2	. My mouth feels like a beach . - How 's your pain ? - Comes in waves . Every 20 , 30 minutes . Every wave , I feel the pain less . But I 'm more numb . The number I get the more I want to sleep . What 's wrong with sleep ? I wish I could so this pain would go away . You 're bleeding inside , Will . You sleep , you do n't know if you 're coming back . Awake , at least you got a shot . Your brain , maybe , keeps you alive . That 's what I think , anyway . You know that movie , G.I . Jane ? What's-her-name ? - Yeah , Demi Moore . - Yeah . You know the part where the drill sergeant says , " Pain is good . Pain is your friend . If you 're feeling pain you 're still alive " ? I did n't see the movie . I keep thinking of that line . Pain is your friend . It means you 're alive .
zone2	go to sleep . Sarge , I got a fire here ! Sarge ! There 's nothing I can do here ! Sarge ! I 'm burning ! I 'm burning ! Please God . Where 'd that wind come from all of a sudden , Sarge ?

I just got in . - Hi , Brian . - Allison , listen , they sent Will down on a bus with a bunch of the guys . - So he did go down there ? - Yeah . And did he go in the buildings ? We do n't know . Brian , did he go in the buildings or did he not go in the buildings ? We 're trying to find that out . It 's very basic . Did he go in or did he not go in ? Allison , I 'll call you as soon as we know . Bianca ? Sweetie , I 'm sorry . Brian , I ...
zone2	going on ? - I 'll take Bianca to my place . - No . - I 'll keep her here . I wan na ... - My parents are there . They 'll take care of her . Okay ? She 'll be five houses away . Want to go play ? ... shards of metal coming past ... Brian ? President Bush was in Florida when the attacks began . He spoke a short time ago from an Air Force base in Louisiana . Here 's some of what the President said . The resolve of our great nation is being tested . But make no mistake , we will show the world that we will pass this test . God bless . We 're told the President 's plane has flown on , but for security reasons , the government will not say where Mr . Bush is going or for how long . I do n't know if you guys know it yet , but this country 's at war . Pastor , I got ta go down there . - Where ? - New York
zone2	allowed in . I 've spent my best years with the Marines . God gave me a gift to be able to help people , to defend our country . And I feel him calling on me now for this mission . Then find a way to listen , Dave . I 'll leave that to you to determine just how widespread the human loss will be in New York City alone . America has changed today . This is a dark day in this country . It 's in bold print in future history books about how America was attacked within its continental borders to devastating effect by terrorists in a coordinated assault using hijacked civilian airliners . - Hey , Mom ? - Yes , sweetie . Dad knows it 's my birthday party Saturday , right ? Your birthday , are you crazy ? Of course he does . He 's just ... He 's still working to help people at the disaster at the Trade Center . But they keep saying a lot of those people are n't coming back . I 'm not supposed to
zone2	that he was gon na take you to the playoffs next month . - The playoffs ? Are you serious ? - I 'm serious . Yes ! The Yankee playoffs ? I knew it . I knew he was going to . Mom , you better come here . Stay here , okay ? What 's wrong ? Dad and Uncle Pat have a deal . If anything happens to one of them , they go and tell the other family . Are you here to tell me something ? Do n't come in here , Pat . I mean it . Do n't you come into this house . Donna , he 's not . We do n't know . We do n't know . They 've declared him as missing , that 's all . He 's just missing . I know . I know . I 'm with you . Come here . I know . We got confirmation . John went in . Oh , Dad . It 's okay , baby . It 's okay . It 's gon na be okay . Hey

How would I tell Bianca her father 's dead ? Missing means missing , Ma . It does n't mean dead . She 's very strong . She 's gon na be all right . - Jer . - Yeah . We 've got to call a doctor . Give her something fast . - Why ? - She could lose it . What is happening to this world ? ... of this horrible and vicious act of terrorism , acts of terrorism . And our focus now has to be on saving as many lives as possible . Do we know the number of casualties at this point ? I do n't think we really want to speculate about that . The number of casualties will be more than any of us can bear , ultimately .
zone2	. Blasted out the lobby . Pushed everything in here . Concourse must have collapsed . You never answered , Sarge . What have we got ? How long does this internal bleeding take ? I do n't know . I 'm not a doctor . Twenty-four hours is the most I 've heard of . Maybe 14 , 16 . Just do n't sleep . So we 've been in six , seven hours . What does that mean ? Another seven , eight hours from now ? You remember that earthquake ? Where was it ? Turkey ? There was a little girl there . She lived four days buried in the rubble like this . She was , like , three years old or something . If she could make it , we can make it . Maybe we ai n't bleeding so bad inside . - Sarge ? - Yeah , Will . You got any kids ? Four .

zone2	district . Very eerie . You saw people being wheeled on gurneys away from the site of the explosions . People were coming out with masks over their face , anything they could put over their face because the air was still very thick with debris . The ash on the ground is at least two inches thick . It 's more like snow cover . Mom , listen . Officials are saying that as many as 400 police , fire and rescue teams entered the towers , and there are fears that half of them are missing and feared lost . We are waiting for more on the survivors . There are no clear estimates yet on numbers , but it is clear that many of New York 's finest have been lost on this day . These are the so-called first responders . Oh , my God . That 's so many . What are we going to do ? Mom , let 's go get him . Can we just go to the city and find Dad ? - We do n't even know where he is

They 'll call when they know something . Lay off your ma , please . This is tough enough on everybody . Come on . You do n't really care , do you ? I 'll go talk to him . Hey , JJ , come on .

Well , moments ago , it did collapse . So that would be the third building in the World Trade Center complex that has collapsed today . There are no reports yet of additional casualties ... Rescue officials in the area have suspended the search for survivors . No word yet on when rescue teams might get back to trying to find anyone ... That 's a lot of guys not with him .

An outstanding athlete , he lives
zone2	, smart- a lethal option . 9 to 1 . Yuri Petrov , Russian special forces . An incredible all-rounder armed to the teeth . Fists , feet , bullets , bombs- utterly merciless , he has it all . Miles Slade , the crazy Texan kid . An outside bet , but he 's mad enough to rise the ranks . Reckless , ruthless , wild , but guaranteed great entertainment . This is one guy who truly loves his job . And if you thought it could n't get any better , we have a dramatic late entrant ... a returning champion who I 'm sure ... will add something very personal to the proceedings . Seven years ago , Joshua Harlow took the Tournament by storm and retired as a champion . But this year he 's back . For one reason , and one reason only- revenge . Joshua 's wife was brutally murdered ... in their Miami home four months ago , and the person who killed her ... is one of this year 's players ! Joshua Harlow is our favorite at 2 to
zone2	. - Tracking bugs online . - Prepare to go hot . Hotter than me in a swimsuit . Cue . As ever , each assassin ... is implanted with a tracking device , so we can find them , and they can find each other . But this year we 've added an extra pinch of spice .

In the name of the Father , the Son and the Holy Ghost , goodbye . I 'm going to enjoy this . Stop ! Stop . Stop ! Please , do n't struggle . So much easier when they do n't struggle . What are you doing ? Just let her go ! I 've got a gun ! I 've got a gun and I 'll use it . Aah ! Do n't move . Or what ? Just ... just stay right there . Stay back ! You need one in the chamber . - Who are you ? -
zone2	, I break your neck . I 'm not . I 'm not ! Where are your weapons ? Who do you work for ? Where do you receive your orders from ? Rome ! No scar . I do n't know what you 're talking about . You 're bleeping . You really do n't know what I 'm talking about , do you ? You really are a priest . Father Macavoy . This is ... was my church . Well , Father , welcome to the Tournament . Thank you . They found the blip . What is it ? It 's our Frenchman . - Anton Bogart ? - It seems he managed ... to cut out his tracking device , and it 's ended up inside that priest . I see .

Tech . okay , maintain visual contact with Bogart . Do n't lose

All right , Miss Hunter , we have Harlow . We have Harlow for you . May I have your attention ? You wanted the greatest show on Earth . out for revenge , the greatest assassin of our time . Cut the shit , Eddy . Oh , shit . - What are you doing here ? - I need information . What have you heard ? I heard someone came for you . I heard it got a bit messy . And I heard about your wife . What did you hear ? Who told you ? The crazy American kid , Miles . He 's your one . Miles Slade , the finger guy ? - Thanks . - You 're welcome . Um ... Whoohoohoo ! Eat shit !

It 's Lai Lai . Make sure that redneck settles his marker ... before he has another coronary . Speak . We have a situation with a civilian . Who are you talking to , the
zone2	's going on . You know the rules , Lai Lai . It 's kill or be killed . You 're like a child running back to Daddy telling me how the big boy stole your ball . You 're on the battlefield . There is no going back . And he 's just one of those famous innocent bystanders you hear about . - Let me speak to him . - no , stop it . - This is Father Macavoy . - I 'll kill you myself . - Let me speak to him . - It 's not right . He 's just a priest . Personally , I find it kind of apt . Back in the day we used to throw Christians to the lions . Seems that history is repeating itself . Carry him or kill him , but do n't call back . What 's happened ? Are the police coming ? Not really . Move ! We have to get out of here now . Move it ! Oh , God ! Someone help me ! Please , help ! God !
zone2	- It 's jammed . - Do n't let me die ! Come here . Come here . Wrong day to be a good Samaritan . When I say " move it " , move it ! - Come on ! - What 's going on ? You 've got a bug inside you . They think you 're a hitter . This is a competition for assassins . That last man standing wins . A game where people kill each other ? Yes , we have to get the tracker out of you , otherwise you 're a target . Why do n't we go to the police ? Eh ? You and I . You acted in self-defense . I 'll speak for you . Is it my accent ? Do I stutter ? Is that it ? The people who run this , they are more powerful than the police . - Somebody ... - They will get you anywhere . - ... do something ! - But the bodies ... people will see the bodies . There will be an explanation . It wo n't be
zone2	buy . A madman with a gun , a terrorist attack , a natural disaster , a car crash . That 's how the Tournament remains a secret ! It 's insane . Do n't you watch TV , Father ? The whole world is insane . now move it ! Come on ! Sir . Sir , can we just reconfirm ? You want to make the priest a player ? You want him on the system ? Was I unclear , Mr . Hamilton ? No . No , sir . It 's ready . It 's ready . - This is bullshit . - Shut up and do it . Ladies and gentlemen , a man of the cloth has stepped out from the sidelines . If any of you good people would like to take a long shot on a man with a dog collar , we 'll take that action . Lai Lai . Will you hurry up ? It 's not coming up . How do you know I 've even swallowed this thing ? How else could it be inside you ? Fuck
zone2	Everybody wants me dead ! - Yes . - oh , fuck ! I do n't wan na die . - It 's okay . - I do n't wan na die . I do n't wan na die . - I do n't know how to cope with this . - You 'll be okay . Trust me . Okay . Oh , thank God . Thank God . Oh , officer , thank goodness you 're here . Nice outfit , Father . Get down ! Come on ! What 's happening ? I 'm not sure , but we have to get out of here now . A policeman 's been killed . - He 's a player . - A player ? Why would anybody want to take part in this madness ? Cash prize , revenge , title , excitement . So what 's your reason ? I 've seen him before . - In the cafe this morning . - Are you sure ? - Positive . - He cut it out . Hold on ! Fuck . Whoo ! Here we go .
zone2	love you , baby . Enjoy your life together . Where were you ? Host on speaker . Joshua , I 'm deeply sorry about your loss , but I may have some information about the person that came after you . I may know where you can find them . Oh , shit . We got another one of those cluster things . Jesus fucking Christ . That 's not a cluster . That is a war zone . Angel 's titty bar ? Are you kidding me ? There 's nine shooters in there . Why are n't they attacking each other ? Probably so many people in the place they do n't know who is who . All right , we got ourselves a situation here . We have nine players in one location . Repeat , nine players in one shithole location . Ladies and gentlemen , we have a bloodbath about to take place . Come on , bitches ! Yeah ! Fuck yeah ! Come on , boys ! Whoo-hoo ! Yeah ! No , you do n't ! I see you , bud
zone2	They 're going down fast . Still taking bets . Come on , boys ! Whoo-hoo ! Yeah ! You fucking son of a bitch . Whoo ! - Ho , ho , ho ! - This is fucked up . oh ! That 's Van de Ven out of the game . Where you at , boys ? Aah ! Aah ! Miles . Bring it on ! Yeah ! Fuck , yeah ! Whoo-whoo ! Whoo ! Was it you , Miles ? Did you come after me ? - Stay still , honey . - Did you murder my wife ? What the fuck you talking about ? Aah ! No , you do n't , honey . Good night , sugar . We 're experiencing problems with transmitting . All units , we have reports of gunfire ... Sorry , we 're completely swamped here . What the hell 's going on today ? God , I need a drink . You drink too much and your eyes give you away . You damage your liver . That 's just perfect . That 's just exactly
zone2	. What are we going to do ? We have to wait until it passes through your system . The further out of town we go , the less accurate the tracker . It will buy us some time . Do you mind if I ask you a question ? Why are you here ? Why are you playing ? Why all the questions ? Why do you drink so much ? Why were you sobbing like a child this morning ? Because I 'm lost . You 're lost ? Try to be me . It must be tough playing God with people 's lives . I do n't play God . If I do n't do it , somebody else will . It 's just a job . nothing more . I do n't believe you . otherwise , why did n't you just kill me ? I do n't kill the innocent . I 'm so happy . Did you feel that ? Please ! Where were you ? Can you hold that for me , buddy ? Huh . Howdy . Look at you . Joshua
zone2	I shit ya , you 're well past your best , ai n't ya ? But , hey , look at the bright side- at least you fell at the hands of this year 's champion . Look at what I did to that guy . What the fuck was I thinking ? Jesus , Miles , you 're a fucking maniac . Thanks . Have a drink , legend . Trying to quit . Just to be clear , old-timer , these are the last few moments of your life you 're experiencing right now . You might as well have a drink with me . Maybe later . Suit yourself , superstar . Go on , now , tell me ... how many kills ? See , I love killing . Just the smell of it . Why Mary ? Mary ? Yeah . Mary who ? I killed a fucking million Marys . You know who . Miami , four months ago . I was n't home . It was me you wanted . Why did you kill her ? Give me a second . Hey ,
zone2	's some nasty shit . Now where were we ? My wife . Yeah . Why were n't you there ? You left her all alone . If I were you ... I 'd blame myself . Bad news , superstar . This is really going to fuck you off . It was n't me . Do n't lie to me , kid . I am not ... a kid ! Whoohoohoo ! I got me a $10 million trigger finger . That 's as close as you 'll ever come , you fucking amateur . Here , let me help you with that . I really wish it was me . Shit , I really do . But I would n't go take credit for other people 's work . That 'd just be wrong . Do n't you pass out on me , legend . I 'm going to tell you who killed your wife . It gives me great pleasure to know ... that you know who did it and that you ca n't do a fucking thing about it . Lai Lai Zhen came after you
zone2	You 're a liar . Am I ? I think I 'll have that drink now . That 's the spirit . Toast the new champion . I think we 're done here . You okay ? oh , no . For a minute there I thought it was all just a bad dream . You 'll be okay . Oh . Oh , please . Please , God , help me through this . Please give me some strength because- because I need a drink ! Sorry , I was ... Bless me , Father , I have sinned . Aah ! Stakes are high , ladies and gentlemen , a favorite will fall . You 're lucky I got to you before Joshua did . He 's pretty pissed you killed his wife . no , no . Wait , wait . Please , please stop . Finish the fucker ! You ... Do n't do it ! Please ! I 'm sorry . Do n't do it . Do n't do it . I 'm sorry . Pull the fucking trigger ! Let 's get as close
zone2	ta wait . He said what ? It 's the right thing . What is it ? What is it ? No ! What is it ? Aah ! Hello ? Mill 's service station . It 's , um- it 's for you . Hello ? Father Macavoy , we have n't met , but I feel I know you intimately . So you 're the sick fucker that 's running all this , are ya ? Such profanity from a man of the cloth . now I suggest you listen to me very , very carefully . Since you deemed it necessary to interrupt what could have been a spectacular kill , I feel I should clarify the rules a little . There 's a time limit you really should take note of . Time limit ? What are you talking about ? It 's very simple . You need to start killing if you want to stay alive . I 'm not going to kill anyone . We shall wait and see . It will be your faith against your desire to live . That device inside
zone2	you 've just witnessed . There 's only four hours left of the game , Father . If there 's more than one player still alive when the clock hits zero , everyone will meet the same fate as your American friend . So let 's see if you have any real guts . It 's kill or be killed . Four hours , Father , and the clock is ticking . Thank you . Well , that 's perfect . Let 's bring a replay of that up on one . Jesus . We have to do that to all of them if the time runs out ? No , it takes them out automatically . What 's the priest doing ? If the sat imagery is correct , he is trying to sort his shit out . Anything yet ? Nothing 's happening . I 'm too tense . It 's got to come out one end or the other . Can you not wait outside ? I 'm staying put . now concentrate . You 're putting me off . Can you whistle or something ? okay
zone2	matter . okay . I thought the way you reacted when you heard-Will you just leave it alone ? Bit of a confession in here , really , eh ? Confession can be incredibly hard . It 's painful to admit our sins and trust ourselves in God 's care . But it helps . It helps ... sometimes . Why do n't you tell me why you 're here ? Hmm ? What 's it got to do with Joshua 's wife ? The last thing you see in a target 's eyes ... is understanding . Somewhere , deep inside of them , they 've been expecting it . Mary Harlow did n't have that look . She just stared at me , like you did this morning-petrified , scared ... bewildered . I saw in her eyes that something was wrong . Please ! My instincts told me to stop . Please ! But I pulled the trigger anyway . I did n't know it until afterwards , but she was pregnant . It 's haunted me ever since . That 's why I have to win

Lai Lai , what are we gon na do ? Drive ! What have I done ? You saved me . I 'm gon na be sick . Shit . okay , that is confirmed , sir . Bogart is down and the priest has officially left the game . What about Joshua ? Father ... what are you doing still here ? I can not protect you anymore . Please go . I do n't wan na go . Why not ? You did n't abandon me , so I 'm not going to abandon you , yes ? We should go . Come on . only five minutes remaining , ladies and gentlemen .

We 're in the final few minutes . I want everything and anything pointed at that fucking church ! Wow , that really helps . okay , okay . If we ca n't show what , we can at least show where . We 'll give ' em something to watch . You have to get to a hospital . I want you to pray with me . of course . You said your prayers ? I hope you said goodbye . Please , this is God 's house . no killing in God 's house . God ? Why , Lai Lai ? Did someone send you , or was it personal ? - Just kill me . - no , no , no . Get it over with . Why ? Why 'd you come after me ? Why 'd you come after me ? I
zone2	n't there for you . I was there for her . The contract was on your wife . Why ? Why would anyone want to kill Mary ? Why ? I do n't know why . We never know why . Please , please . Joshua , please . She 's not to blame . She 's not to blame for any of this . She 's a device , like a tool . - She did n't want to kill your wife . - no , shut up ! - She did n't want to kill-- Shut up ! Mary was my life . Mary was my life ! Who hired you ? She was your life . She was your life . Do n't dishonor her now with death . Who hired you ? - You 're dishonoring her with death ! - Shut up ! Who hired you ? You know who hired me . Joshua , what would Mary do ? What would Mary have you do ? We have a winner . Ladies and gentlemen , I want to present to you ... the two-time
zone2	greatest assassin of our time ! Joshua ... I know everything . Why ? What ? I put on a good show , did n't I ? You can keep all this money that I won , if you just tell me why you murdered my wife . You 're delirious , Joshua . I 'm dying , but you 're sweating . now why is that ? What 's the matter , you afraid to admit it ? Come on . Come on , we 're all killers here ! You need a doctor . You 're being absurd . Why ? Why did you murder my wife ? or are you too fucking gutless ? Why ? Because it was necessary . You did n't want to come back to the Tournament . I was n't going to accept that . You 're the reigning champion . Look at you , Joshua ! You 're a warrior , gladiator . Men like you do n't die in your beds , they fall on the field . They give the crowd ... a glorious death . Why ? Why
zone2	'd have said no . You needed a little motivation-pressure ... on that little chink in the armor . Close your eyes . You and your wife will be together soon . I love you , baby . Host .

Terror stepped up a notch today . Bombs are believed to have gone off in both a city center church and a popular strip bar on the outskirts ... our little town has been tested , played witness to events beyond comprehension , besieged by darkness . ... many major road accidents , the worst of which a mile-long motorway pileup . And yet , here we are again , our spirits renewed ... reborn . ... the debilitating lack of any CCTV footage to increase surveillance to blanket proportions . Macavoy . I 'm reminded of the words of

You would hardly believe how good it sounded , the words , ich liebe dich , I love you . It was a dream . Adam . Adam , it 's time . Oh , my landlady Ruth Edelson . Let me ask you something . Am I still handsome this morning ? Tell the truth now , come on . Of course you are , Adam . I do n't think there 's any time for the- for the breakfast . You know , I have never asked you , my darling , how old are you ? Forgive me , you are the witch . You are the hexer . You have swindled time . Adam , please . After you fell asleep last night , darling , I lay there . I was thinking , " My God , this woman 's skin is unnaturally smooth . " It is like porcelain . In fact , I can see my reflection in

Yeah , do not forget this Olivetti please . We wo n't , pal , come on . Forgive me , Adam . I should n't have called them . Please forgive me . It 's all right , Ruth . Oh , you taste like ... soap . So why 'd you do it , Adam ? Do it ? What is it you think that I did ? You know , that old magic trick where you separate a woman 's spinal column from her skull . Choking his landlady . Oh , this is- that 's ridiculous . Nah , he did n't mean to hurt her . Just wanted us to bring him home again . Right , Adam ? Yeah , woof , woof . And so I was once again returned to my home

Do you see that ? Come on . Big guy 's waiting . Adam . Oh , that 's a big hug . He 's back . I am so happy to see you too . Yes , still sweeping . Am I tracking- I do n't want to track sand on your- on your floor . And hell to Rebecca . All my best friends . What 's this ? Oh , transport . Have they all gone insane ? Well ... Two hundred bucks . Adam , been hiding them for months . You 've got to tell me what to do . ATT , Mr . Blum , New York Stock Exchange . Here , give it to me . I will double it for you in- in no time . - Adam . - Yeah ? Columbus was Jew ? Yes , yes , Mrs . Lipowitz . Columbus was definitely a Jew but
zone2	, I would not trust an Italian , and neither should you . Yeah , it 's true , they 're an enlightened bunch . But they licked the jackboot , and now they expect everyone to forgive and forget . - My train . - Yeah . You . Really , Arthur , you know that Mrs . Seizling strictly forbade any form of locomotive combustion at the Institute . My train . Arthur-You know what I 'm talking about . Fellow survivors , it 's so good to be back here at the Institute , though not as inmate , not as guinea pig . No , this time , I am on the mission to expose the lunacy of the medical staff here at the Seizling Institute , the negligence , Dr . Shapiro , and the impotence of Herr Professor Nathan Gross , et al . He 's lying . Authorized by whom ? And here she comes . I could hear her methodical footfalls and irregular heartbeat . Nurse Gina Grey , a pearl in a dunghill , a book of rules , and with
zone2	No . No . Adam . Would you come with me ? Dr . Gross wants to say hello . No . No . Would you please swallow those pills , Mr . Blum ? Hmm , not now . You 've lost some weight , Adam . Oh , yeah , I was - I was pining for you , my child . The nights have been the worst , you know . Hmm . I 've heard about your nights . But I 'm sure you did n't mean to hurt your landlady . Come in , Adam . Oh , come here , Gina . Let me smell something . Oh , yeah , just like I remember . Touch me . Touch me . Come in already . Yes , you love doing that , do n't you , Adam ? Uh , oh , yeah , the- the sharp transition . Here one moment ... You know , Adam-Gone the next . What I ca n't figure out , why have n't we been able to help you ? You 're a brilliant man .
zone2	Stein , next of kin : none whatsoever , number on my arm : sieben , sechs , drei , vier , fuenf . Gross , file it away and let me go . And yet , you see , for all your knowledge , your sixth , seventh sense , here you are back at the Institute after trying to kill a woman less than 24 hours ago . This is a lie . No , this is a lie . - Yes . - No , that 's a lie . A woman named Ruth Edelson . And you , Gross , you are- you 're a joke . Ah , do you want to tell me why ? Yeah , back there , it was absurd to believe ... in anything . In the sun we did not believe . And yet you , here of all places , you believe in miracles . You not only believe in them ; you depend on them . This is not only hilarious ; this is chutzpah . - Adam . - Yeah ? There 's only one person
zone2	circus tricks . I could teach them to you in a day . Listen , Grossie . See , I 've been the- the star of your- your medical experiments , and you have failed miserably . So do n't you dare talk to me about some miracles . Now , of course , my job is to fail . I am the sick dying clown . Fine , this is my business . But what have you done to help me , to help any of us ? No , you 're right . And I 'm sorry from the bottom of my heart . As long as you know . Now let 's just see what 's going on with your lovely personal affairs . Oh , now , wait a minute . Please . Adam , stop . It has not been your day , has it , Doctor ? Some milk of magnesia . That would solve the problem . Constipation , it 's a horrible thing , but do n't strain . Cut it out . You do n't have to suffer that way .
zone2	constructively . Oh , I could if I wanted to . But , you know , I - I do not . No , I am going to be your miracle that never was . And we 've heard all this before , Adam . Go on and get some rest . Go , already . Get out of here . Where the hell is all this coming from ? And no pulse . Maybe in a hundred years , we 'll know how to help the Adam Steins of this world . Adam . - Step back , Rachel . - Adam . Get away from him . Rachel . - Is it time , Adam ? - Step away from him . Rachel . Oh , thank God . The birth pang of the Messiah . I knew it . They 've begun . Oy very . It 's good to have you back , Adam . Frau Fogel , the whisky in the baby bottle , please . My wife , Gretchen . Little Ruthie . Thank you , Frau Fogel . Ah , malt whisky .
zone2	? All right , please . Oh . Gretchen . So sweet . Blech . Ah , she does n't like it . She does n't like it . The most expensive Stradivarius . Here we go . Ladies and gentlemen , meine Damen und Herren Adam Stein . My wife , Gretchen . Oh , so beautiful . Oh , no , no , you can not keep survival off the stage . Do n't scare me like this . My darling . A volunteer . Oh-ma-ha . Yeah-ha . Everybody loves this . No , you volunteer too often . This fellow , please , may we ? Bitte nicht . Please , my eye fell on you right away , please . Such a good sport , give him a hand . He 's shy . All right , now , have we ever met ? Do we know each other ? - Nein . - Nein . All right . This young man , ladies and gentlemen , well , did not want to come to Adam 's circus tonight . This man had other plans
zone2	own life . No , my friend , no . Please , do not go this way . Let me just glean just a little . Maybe there 's some good news here . Let me see . We have here , folks , a graduate of Heidelberg Universitaet . Oh , though , obviously no- no star pupil . This is Zyklot 17 , the animal tranquilizer . Yeah , for the permanent relief of pain . Yeah . Oh . Oh . Tell her to leave me alone . I do not have the strength . Do you hear what I 'm asking you ? I would if I wanted to . But I do n't . What the hell are you doing ? Shut up , darling , and move over . You are insane . I am calling the night nurse . Right here at your service ? Adam ? Ladies and gentlemen , we bring now to the stage my daughter , the amazing , the brain-bending , Miss Ruthie . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Is n't she so amazing ? You are
zone2	not see anything , can you , Ruthie ? - No . - No . She says no . She 's looking askance at me , my- my darling wife . Oh , I love to get a smile out of my wife . Give her a big hand . What 's down there ? Ah , I love that . Ow . My wife , Gretchen . I pick up the first blade , so absolute silence . Here we are . Ruthie , do n't . She will do anything to avoid this part . You do n't like this part , but no brain bending . That is-When you pulled up the thing and you winked at the audience and they went crazy , you were killing me . That stays in the show . Papa . You are a little genius , I think . Papa , there 's a man . Was that spontaneous , or did you work it out before ? Tell me . - That 's your bit . - Adam , it 's him . Volk . Well , Herr Stein
zone2	You do not qualify . No sense of humor at all . Tell me this . Did your men like that bit with the bear ? Erschiessen . You were warned , Adam . I am not political . Everyone loves the circus . Well , I have to admit , things have been less interesting around here . It seems incredible . A man who only yesterday spewed out streams of blood from his toe . Not to mention the pancreatic tumor he sprouted in March . And the heart attack last summer . The man has actually spat out part of a lung . I mean , it 's an amazing thing , the self-destruction . The amazing thing about Adam Stein is n't his control over his body . It 's his power over you , Nathan . What ? And a few other staff members I could name . Relax , Uri . Eat your foie gras . - Adam . - Look who 's here . And , Wolfowitz , now look , mein Gott I'm Himmel , you look just awful . It 's
zone2	, you pumpkin . Gorgeous , absolutely gorgeous . And Zelda , dear , yeah , you keep the sky from falling , but- but sit . Adam , Schwester 's been dreaming again with her nonsense . She says it 's soon , very soon . And she is right , Wolfowitz . Yes , beautiful , what is it ? Tell me . He came again last night . - Shh . - It 's a secret ? The Archangel . He lay beside me and said , " This time Adam has returned to lead the sufferers , " the bearers of the blue numbers , to the desert . The gates of heaven will open and- " No , of course- of course I will , Rachel . That day is near , but not yet , dear . Not- not before lunch . I will usher and proclaim and rescue . Me , the clown ? You see that ? You know he takes money from the patients ? Invests it in the stock market . Gross . You ? For the Institute , Slonim
zone2	's a very astute financial advisor . You 're worse than Rachel Schwester over there . She thinks he 'll lead them all to salvation . Adam , I need to talk to you . No , later , later . What is it ? What is it , Adam ? Hoof beats ? Gross . Who let a dog in here ? Nathan , who let a dog in here ? What are you talking about ? There 's no dog here . When I first came here , they promised me that there would never , ever be any dogs . How could you ? Calm down . Edward , how are you today ? My God . Adam . Adam . All right . Come on , Adam , come on . Okay . Yeah , good . Good . Yeah . Papa . You are my angel , Ruthie . Do not be frightened . You . Well , Adam Stein . The funniest man in Germany , delivered to Stellring , of all places . Come here , Adam . I am Commandant Klein .
zone2	see you here . You should have seen him at the circus in Berlin . Any kind of animal , he could do it . Such a clown . Go on , Adam . Do a trick . Make us laugh . Mama , Mama . Ruthie ? Where are you taking me ? No , no , no . Now- now do a dog for Rex here . You 've made a friend , Adam . The smell of a Jew usually sends Rex into a frenzy . Sergeant , take Herr Stein to Rex 's pen . No , Adam ... on all fours . It 's funnier that way . Go on , Adam ... or Rex will get all the meat . I followed your career , Adam . You studied philosophy at Heidelberg , did n't you ? Funny we never met there . Herr Kommandant , please . I 'm a keen observer , a student of the Semitic phenomenon . Of course , you 're not an average specimen , Germany 's most celebrated clown . You 're a superman , Adam ,
zone2	. Head down . Do n't look at me . A life for a life . Mine for yours . You stay here with me , make me laugh , keep my mind off the business outside . Believe me , it 's a thankless job . My wife and daughters . What 's that ? Speak up , Adam . My wife and daughters . Bargaining already , Adam . The Semitic phenomenon in action , right here at my feet . Unfortunately , I am only Untersturmfuehrer . I do n't make the rules . But we 'll see . Yes , we have plenty of time . Rex . Go on , Adam . Wonderful , Adam . Now , eat . Eat . Schmackhaft . Nothing with claws or paws . Seizling gave me her word . Room 285 is in the observation ward . It 's off-limits . Now , Gina tells me that you slept on the floor again last night . Oh , is this how you 're going to break me , Gross , with a dog ? Well , nice try
zone2	smiling . No , actually , Adam , you 're crying . It is- Yeah , you momzer- water . I had a - I had a drink of water on the way . Through your eyes ? Come on , Adam , you can do better than that . Okay , I am ready for you , Frankenstein . If experiments are your game , then let 's play . Give me your best shot . But before you cure me , you will all go crazy yourselves . The door to 285 is locked . I 'm glad to see you feeling better , Adam , but we 're a little busy at the moment . Not now . You and I , my darling , we 're going to cry together , and I 'm going to drink your tears . Yes , I love very deeply . It is the romance supreme . Do you understand , my- my dar-There are rules , Adam . Compassion . Mercy . You 're the nurse . What- what happened to-You break the tiniest rule , you break the
zone2	great believer in the rules ? Hmm ? Kommandant Klein . Ow . What a terrible thing to say . Yeah , well , I only insult people I love . You do n't love me . You treat me like a dog . Yeah , exactly . Oh , but you 're so wrong . With you , I lose control . When I was strangling the landlady , who do you think I was really strangling , Gina ? You . You bastard . Do it . Do it like I taught you , sweetheart . No , they 'll hear me . Do it . Yeah , down on your knees and crawl . That is correct . Yeah , but that sounds like a schnauzer . I want the wolfhound . Oh , I like it . Oh , that 's right . Oh , that 's right . You 're despicable , darling . Just give it back when you 're done . Let me see what kind of beast has Gross brought here . Let me see what you are . Come here .
zone2	, Adam . Come on . Come on , let 's go . Bad dog . Bad dog . Bad dog . Okay , let me see your hand . I told it I 'd be back , and it understood . Get back in there . The stench . Lying in his own goddamn feces . But the attendant , that flea-bitten gibbon , he did not . Adam , stop . Stop it now . Son of a bitch . Crazy son of a bitch . Before Hitler , we were hated by the rest of Europe , loved only by our Jews , who somehow convinced themselves that our two nations shared a common destiny . A pair of pariahs , so said your man Kafka , that demented Hebrew . Sprung from the same bosom . No wonder it 's such messy business vomiting you from our midst . Adam ! Down , boy ! Without rules , there is chaos . I know you can appreciate this . Even in a circus , there are rules . Herr Kommandant . Those trucks outside , the
zone2	begging for favors , do you ? They are taking prisoners to Matsdorflager . Ask them to take three more . Rex knows his role : to serve and protect . You know yours : to comfort and entertain . And who knows ? Maybe that in itself can save a life , yes ? Yes . Danke schoen . Look , Adam . Look what I found for you . It once played in the Dresden Orchestra . There 's been some rethinking . We have new work for you . That 's nice , Adam . Adam Stein ? Frau Fogel . Listen , Adam . I have news . Quiet over there . Ruthie 's alive , inside Germany , someplace special . Play it , Adam . You 're crying , Adam . It is water . I had some water before . Did I kill him ? Almost . You 've got to be more careful , Adam . We still need you . Danke schoen . Listen , Adam . I 've had it . In a month 's time on Purim 's Eve
zone2	dead man . What ? I 've been sewing my own shrouds from bed sheets . Do n't tell Gina . You are not going to leave me alone in this madhouse , Abe . Seriously , Adam . Me and- and Him , we 're going to have it out once and for all . I want to know how- how He could be so cruel . And if He wo n't come to me , I 'll go to Him , and you 'll write my eulogy . Okay , I - I 'll write your eulogy . Such a beautiful child , my little Naomi . Did n't look anything like me . Got it all from her mother . You write it down , Adam . What do I write , Wolfie , addressed to whom , God ? God is out to lunch . He left a note , see , on your- on your arm . Do n't say that name . You are not going to kill yourself . You remind me of Rabbi Lichtenstein , who- who back in Stellring- listen- would
zone2	Satan 's . Listen . But I would argue that the crimes of Klein are the crimes of Hitler , but the crimes of Hitler are the crimes of the Lord . No , no , no , no , Adam . You get some rest . We can do this later . But wait , wait , Wolfie . The- the thing in 285 barks like a dog , smells like a dog , but uh , the teeth ? Do I know , Adam ? It's- it 's just some crazy kid raised in a basement with a chain around its neck . A kid ? Gross says it 's dangerous . Nobody goes near it . He 's Gross ' special project . So you think- you think that you are the only one ? Yeah ? Yeah . Let me tell you , oh , there are others . Me , for instance . Yeah . Oh , yeah . I am the con man . I am the freak . I am the monstrosity . I am the genius . But true genius , it
zone2	the opera . The mathematician unlocks the secrets of the universe . But me ? Oh , my gifts , worthless . And so I was marked for the circus . I was destined for the sideshow . And for the doghouse . Yeah . Oh , you did n't know this , did you ? Oh , yeah . For one whole year , I ate from the dog bowl , lived on all fours , slept in the pen , shat on the ground . I learned from the master . Sturmfuehrer Rex . But now do you see where my gifts have delivered me ? Now , hang on , come here . Wait , wait , come here . Shh . Hang on . Hang on . Yeah , let me just see this . The dog that is not the dog , the child that is not the child . This is the way they looked , back there in the camps , sunken cheeks , tubercular chests , and from inside the blackened sockets , those eyes sick with fear but alive . Enough
zone2	is a place for survivors , right ? Yes . Well , what is this boy doing here ? Why- what are you doing with this comb ? Gina , do not- do n't make- do n't do it with the comb . Well , Dr . Gross brought him . Yes , Gross . He was howling and biting himself , sodden with his own filth . We tried to get that awful chain off him , but , you saw ; it 's still on . No one has the right to be more than me , not you , not the dog . - More what ? - Crazy . He 's crazier than me . You 're not crazy . I am crazy . - You 're sick . - No , I am crazy . You 're sick . That dog is superior to me , do you understand this ? No ? He has succeeded where I have failed . He is Gross ' star . I think I have a right to say-That you love me . How did you know what I
zone2	. You love the crazy , the aging , the sub-human Adam Stein . Why is this ? Why ? A healthy Adam Stein , for you , not so attractive . It 's important that you know , really know . Makes no difference why , but I do with all my heart . Yes , you 're a whore , and I use you . Now , listen , my landlady , Ruthchen , the quiet type , fucking her was like fucking butter . Fucking you is like fucking the motorcycle . You 're cruel , darling . Oh , Gina , Gina , it 's a little humor . Child , this is what saves everything . Klein knew it well . You can weed out more sub-humans in a day with humor and Zyklon B than you can with Zyklon B alone . It 's the combination . Yeah . Adam . What are you doing in there ? Adam , you devil . Well , it is Purim , after all , and I can get another toothbrush . Now , back to work
zone2	looks a little too- I do n't know- healthy . Do n't you think ? Blacken the eye sockets , for your Purim costume . Rex , hold still . And ? Oh yeah , of course , yeah , yeah . Here we go , Rex . Yeah , you 're a prisoner . Look scared ; he is the Kommandant . Wonderful . A Purim to remember . Kommandant , my family . You 're a comfort , Adam ... a lifesaver . Before you came , it was killing me . Now it 's better . Bravo . Bravo , maestro . Whoo ! Adam , Adam . - Schwester . - Adam ? You are looking today so very , very transcendent . Thank you . Tell me , have you been grooming this little moustachio of yours ? Oh , this is so becoming on a woman . It 's a very , very striking kind of thing of course . But do you not think it is a little warm for the woolen Unterhosen ? Thank you . Adam , I prayed for you
zone2	, Schwester , bringing a man back into prison when he 's having such a swell time on the outside . L'Chaim , Schwester . Mmm . I accept your assignment . I will be your holy ventriloquist . But just now , I have got to see a man about a dog , shalom . Woe be the shepherds of Israel that feed themselves . Auf Wiedersehen . Should n't the shepherds feed the flocks ? Good-bye . I am so sorry that I just popped up before and ran off . I got thirsty . Did they torture you ? Who was it ? Golomb ? That tiny Torquemada with the jangling keys ? Sturmfuehrer Slonim ? You can tell me . You 're the only one that I can talk to in this godforsaken place . Yes , you are not a phony . And to me , this is a- this is a very big deal . Believe me , I can sniff one a mile away . And so can you , can you not ? It is you and Adam Stein against the world
zone2	take the trial run . On we go . Yes , I know you 're a dog . I understand . There 's nothing to be ashamed of . Do n't panic . No , this is laundry , dirty laundry . Yeah , let 's take a little tour . Oh , look who 's here . Look who 's coming . Do you really think this is doing the boy any good ? He 's a dog , Gina . Show a little respect . - Come on . - Hey . Yeah , this is Gina Grey 's classy ass . Shoo . Yeah , looky , look who 's here . Look at them , kid . These- these wretched souls have- have chimneys for hearts . And Gross tries to heal them with , mescaline , LSD , hypnotherapy . Knows that it can not be done . And Seizling ? Yeah , she thought she could save these walking tombstones too . Thought I could save them . But I never said that I could . I never promised them the burning bush .
zone2	How 's the knitting , by the way ? You 're not the rebel you think you are . You know what ? Look over there . There 's a man behind the curtain , pulling your strings . Yeah , I 'm giving another talk tomorrow . A history of drama from the dawn of man till the present entitled " Whisky and Dramaturgie " . Do try to come . All right , are we all here ? Yes , we are . Then let's- let 's begin . Mm . A dog barks . But a dog barking on a stage is no longer a dog . This bottle , for instance , I pour . I raise this glass to my mouth , and I swallow . Mm . But am I really drinking , or am I a man playing a man who is drinking ? Close your eyes . Yeah , that 's right . Not so fast , Arthur . You 've got to register first , please . Name . Schwester , you know my name . Arthur , we all registered
zone2	Arthur Fine . Perfectly fine , Arthur . Schwester , where was I ? " But am I really drinking , or am- " Exactly , folks . We 're all actors ... in a drama which both playwright and director have long ago abandoned . Nonetheless , meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren , ladies and gentlemen , to bring the curtain down is impossible . The show must go on . Hey , what 's going on ? He 's drunk . He 's really drinking up there . Adam , you 're a liar . Nonsense . Nonsense , Arthur . It is water . You , of all people , should appreciate what I 'm trying to teach these people , the artifice , the necessary lie that we all needed to survive . Mm-hmm . Here , here , here 's a quick example . Yeah . It is 1945 . It is dark . A man is running through the Naliboki Forest with a cocktail ? A Molotov cocktail , yeah . The war is over , but not everyone knows it yet .

And for a while , you forgot the first rule of Dramaturgie . You found a wife , a daughter .

My Naomi , my beautiful little Naomi , she was Queen Esther that year . I 'd sewn her a dress and made a crown from a tin can . That night after services , we snuck out . The Nazis were a few blocks away , so I knew we had some time . Just outside of the ghetto , there lived a Mrs . Marshack . She used to bring me all her children 's coats to mend . And in her house , there was a basement . And under the basement , there was another basement , a pit with

Well , I 'm sure Adam will be more than delighted to share the credit . Nathan , please . Adam is unstable . He 's dangerous .

He was meticulous , which is how he rose so fast through the ranks . But this one file , he put aside . In fact , he stole it . And incredibly , it was never missed . Patton 's Third Army has crossed the Danube . The Russians are in Berlin . It 's the end . For me , this document is useless . But we had a deal , you and I . A life for a life . So here .

Properly cooked , they 're as tender as butter . They can be roasted , stuffed with wild rice or barley or you can broil them , poach them barbecue them , and even braise them . But there 's no greater sin than to overcook a quail . Perfectly cooked , it must have a touch of pink on the breast . But you need the right quail . It has to be fleshy or it dries out too easily . I prefer to serve them roasted . That makes their taste richer and more robust . And a side of truffle ravioli and wild mushrooms goes deliciously well with them . Of course , you can also cook them in a pig 's bladder in a mix of Madeira and cognac . You see , the bladder helps protect the quail , keeps it moist . You could serve it with a tender sauce of thyme , spring onions caramelized shallots , truffles . Truffles go perfectly with
zone2	. Are you feeling okay ? I 'm fine . Go on . They wonderfully elevate the delicate taste of the quail . But you have to really be able to afford truffles otherwise you just better forget about it . - Now , for a appetizer , I suggest ... - Kate , would you mind if I change the subject for a moment ? - No .

zone2	an ancient and fanciful knocker which gripped my childish imagination as surely as the claws of that old rook . It showed a great fish or sea serpent curving down to swallow a rival 's tail . But all of that was years ago , and now , like my old friend the sea serpent , I have returned to devour my rival 's tail by telling a new tale of a man , of madness and of murder . Bloody hell !

Then I might let you try the TV listings , someday . Or the obituaries . That 's a lovely view . But you can stick it , and your obituaries , and your job . Cheers . I had left my humble beginnings far behind and was enjoying a new life in London writing about the great men of Parliament for the Daily Sketch . I had a fine new home , and completed this scene of prosperity by taking to wife one Maud Abercrombie . All went well . At work , I busied myself in the recording of speeches on the want of thrift among the poor , the need to extend our empire to the heathen , and the importance of the monarchy in the very fabric of our lives . One day , while transcribing a minister 's pronouncements on the need to set an example to
zone2	to their betters , I felt moved to inquire if the minister himself had ever experienced hunger or indeed the want of any material thing that might cause him to question the proper order of the world . He gave me a quizzical look , but no reply . Only when I repaired to my office did I discover I had been cashiered to the post of sub-editor as punishment for my intemperate outburst . (

There was , she said , no point in living when her husband neglected her , pursued other women , and would surely abandon her at the earliest opportunity . Her mood was not improved by news of my disgrace at work . Over the following months , her mind became ever feebler , filled with wild allegations of infidelity or abandonment . Fearing for her sanity , I sent for her sister Alice , just 18 , but of even temper and sweet nature , whom , I reasoned , might cure her sister 's ill humor or , at least , assist in the running of the household . It was to prove a very grave mistake . SADIE ON ANSWERING MACHINE : Hi , Mike , sorry I was in a rush . I 've got a really great riddle for you . Not before breakfast , Sade .

Willis , of all the pricks in all the world ... Can we get down there ? The arrival of young Alice should have been cause for celebration . She was as bright as she was beautiful . And her luster brought a new brilliance to our hitherto sad house . Yes , the brighter shone this star , the worse grew my wife . Gradually , Alice was forced to take over the running of the household , as her sister emerged

Your journo mates over there told me you were very pally with the dear departed . I 'm sorry , Mr . Sullivan , good luck . - When did you last see her ? - Last night in the pub , closing time . - And you did n't think to mention it ? - You was too busy talking to listen .

If Willis finds out Sadie phoned me the night before she died , I 'm going to be getting a free transfer from my reporting desk to one of his cells . What are you doing here ? Taking a bit of a risk , are n't you ? - Why ? - Willis on the warpath . - Strict instructions not to talk to you . - Well , you 're doing all right so far . Lucky for you , Willis is a prize prat . - Pub landlady , anything to go on ? - Get togged up . I 'm not having you contaminating my dead people . Suits you . Sadie ? My ignominious
zone2	me time to write . Even in this , Alice proved to be a muse . When I came home , weary of currycombing the platitudes of politicians , she would become my scribe , writing out my sketches and observations as I spoke aloud . But even these pleasant interludes would be interrupted , as my wife , at times quite deranged , would pall from her bedchamber , demanding attention , assuring us that she knew of some terrible wickedness which we were visiting upon her . Indeed , upon reflection , I blame myself , for Alice proved to be all that her sister was not . Seeking to ease her torment , I brought her a mirror of all her imperfections . Jesus !

Was she dead before she hit the water , too ? Not her . Lungs full of old Father Thames . Veins full of heroin . Sort of team effort , bit like cricket . I 'll see you later . Thanks . Tom 's an old friend . He 's been very helpful . So , what did you find out ? The suicide junkie , been arrested for possession , just small stuff . But they get suicides and ODs every other night . - Nice way to earn a living , eh ? - Jumpers and dumpers . - What ? -

Tom said they stopped a boat a few days ago putting drums into the river , but it turned out to be legit , some water quality survey . What about the riddle ? What did PC Pugwash think about that ? Or was he too busy trying to get you into his captain 's cabin ? His exact words , " Tell your mate it sounds like a load of old bollocks . " - He would . Come on . - Where ? Hot date ?

Swept you off your feet there , did n't I ? Look ! It 's not the picture . Look ! Oak sealed with a knot ! " The Riddle by Charles Dickens . " To lighten Alice 's burden , I undertook to bring her to the theater , and for one evening , both of us were truly happy . But at the intermission , Alice commenced to complain of nausea
zone2	and hailed a carriage . By the time the doctor arrived , her breathing had grown ever more shallow . Without her uttering another word , the life went out of her so gently that it took the good doctor sternest entreaties to convince me that the worst had come to pass . The doctor surmised that the exertions of caring for her sister had hastened her end , but opined that only a full post-mortem study would bear out his belief . I would not hear of it . Alice lay there , still warm , still perfect in form , like an angel fallen to earth . To mar this perfection with a surgeon 's knife was unthinkable . Do you think you could get the lads to do a test on the paper and the ink , just on the QT ? I 'm sure my winning ways could work on the boys in the lab . Hang on , I 've just reached a good bit .

You 're the owner of a genuine page of unpublished Dickens . I slowly began to ascend the staircase . Something my wife had said the previous evening , when I announced my theater engagement , had gnawed at my mind , like the rats in the wainscot of my cold childhood home . In my heart , I knew that the thing which had halted Alice 's too good heart lay not among the fates , nor in her constitution , but in the terrible deed of a mad woman who even then lay gibbering and cursing in our marriage bed . What a story . Poor old Cedric . I 've got enough trouble with real crime , let alone made up one's

But I 'm ready to give you another chance . That 's very nice of you , considering I 'm innocent . Well , a judge might not think so . You can say ta ta to your career and your girlfriend 's . Or ?

Not worried at all . SKENSHAL : When I confronted my wife , she confessed , silently . She reached under her pillow and gave me a small vial with a glass dropper . It was some tincture given to her nurse with strict instructions to take only one drop in extremis . The bottle was empty . As the enormity of her act brought its weight down upon her already enfeebled mind , she became a child , gibbering and crying of a hangman who stood by her bed . For a moment , I also became that executioner , as I prepared to snuff out that sorry half-life that had robbed me of all happiness . But , as I held the pillow above her , my anger dissolved . Though I loathed her for her unspeakable act , it

If the truth should come out , would a jury be so lenient ? Was it not more likely they would see only the crime and hang the poor wretch or incarcerate her forever in some cell in Bedlam ? The truth would not bring Alice back . I resolved to ensure that Alice was buried with her secret , which I , in turn , would take to my grave . - Mike Sullivan ? - Have you got something for me , fellas ? Fall down , for starters .

Well , your friend with the chloroform did n't like the look of my anchor . And I did n't much care for the look of his knife , so I swapped you for his chum . Very civilized , really .

Glad you did n't call the police . No , I 'm not very keen on the constabulary . I 'm starting to think that way myself . What was that you said , something about some fellas trying to steal the river ? In their boat . They were filling plastic drums , like this , full of river water . Strange , really . It 's not very nice to drink . It 's good for tea though . Oh , yes , now . I 've been saving something for you . Let me see . Here . That 's from Ophelia . KATE : Wait , wait , just one second .

zone2	camera_clicking ) That 's the big bastard that bashed me up by the river . The one with the tie on is Baby Jimmy . Finally a connection . Junkie Kelly 's Baby Jimmy 's girlfriend and the others work for him . Why beat you up ? Apart from being a complete bastard who brings tramps home . Do n't put yourself down , darling . Maybe Baby Jimmy 's got the hump that I 'm snooping into his girlfriend 's death . Then maybe it 's time to hand it over to Willis . Are you serious ? We 're finally in business . This is like getting the first clue in the crossword . But you 're crap at crosswords . Only because you wo n't stop talking and I ca n't concentrate . That might be it . Apart from yours
zone2	arrested recently ? - Junkie . - Six times in the last two weeks . Maybe she was going to talk . Maybe the police were leaning on her to grass on Jimmy . - I 'll check it out . - Be careful . I 'm already on a warning for sleeping with the enemy . I 've come this far . Anyway , it 's my birthday tomorrow and just for once I 'd like a date that does n't involve McDonald 's , funerals and drowning . Think you can handle that ? At first , I had the excuse of grief to cloak my unwillingness to dwell on the death or on my wife 's affliction . Then came a knock at the door . Such a knock as I had not heard since the day Ezekial Graspett had breathed his last rattling gasp in the silence of my childhood home . Just such a knock came to my London home that night as Alice lay cold . I steadied my hand sufficiently to unbolt the great door , the servants having retired , and on
zone2	, clad in a dark cape that shimmered in the rain , stood there , saying not a word , staring at me with eyes that burned in a florid face like coals in a sea of ash . This , I discovered by degrees , was Constable Frederick , sent to investigate Alice 's untimely death . What is it ? I 've got dead people waiting . Could you tell if the Thames junkie injected herself or was injected ? - Very tricky . - What about the chloroform ? If she was doped and then injected , do you think that would show up ? Probably . Depends on the dose . - Could you have a look again for me ? - Okay . No one has claimed the body . Then you better scram before Willis sees you . Dickens . Have you read Our Mutual Friend , about fishing dead bodies out of the river ? No . - And what 's that , a suspect or your lunch ? - Neither . Urine samples . I 've told uniform 100 times , I
zone2	by the jam jar , by the bloody bucket load . He 's taking the piss . Now , this is more like it . Roy said there was no chloroform found in the junkie 's body . And the bruises could have come from anywhere . Not exactly a watertight case , is it ? Thanks for not taking the piss . That 's it . Taking the piss . Roy said he only needed small samples . What about the water ? If you was testing it , you 'd only need a small jar . - Not great big plastic drums . - Plastic drums . The marks on her shoulders could have come from while they were holding her underwater . But why risk drowning someone in public ? Not if you 're holding her under in the bath tub . MIKE : One double , skinny latte . I thought you said it was coffee . - That 's rather good . - See . Forgive me if I seem to be a bit slow , but when a purveyor of opium wishes to remove
zone2	her ? Well , with his record , somebody ODs in his apartment , Willis would twig it . But a junkie turns up in the Thames , who cares ? But what about your clever friend who fillets people for a living ? Roy ? Why 's that ? Well , would n't he know the difference between a body filled with Thames water and one filled with tap water ? Well , they thought of that . They filled the bath with the river water . So that 's why the boys were messing about on the river with the water barrels . Look , I 'll show you . She goes back to the apartment , he greets her , " Poor girl ! Had a hard time at the station ? " You 're home now . Would you like some free drugs ? " I 'll run you a bath . " They put her in the bath . The drugs kick in . She struggles . She gets her bruises while they 're holding her under . One problem . We 've got nothing
zone2	. Perhaps we should call in and ask them . - Here they are . - Look . And once they 've gone , we 'll try and get in . Come , Watson , the game 's afoot . Wait ! No . Get back in here . Get back . Get back in here . - Hurry up , dear Watson . - Just hold still . - Will you stop with that Watson business ? - Well , make haste , my good sir . Why ? Do you think Baby Jimmy 's in the Neighborhood Watch or something ? But you , sir , are no sugarplum fairy . Get back to the car and stay there . It 'll only take us five minutes , and I 'll be back with you later . Yeah . So ? (
zone2	clearing_throat ) - What ? - Pizza . What ? - TRAMP : A pizza delivery . - What ? - ? 11.50 . - Hey , Jimmy , you order a pizza ? - JIMMY : No , bollocks . - What you mean ,
zone2	Do you know I ca n't recollect . It 's very good . - It 's half-eaten . - Oh , dear , how unfortunate . Look , I 'll tell you what , you can have it for free . What ? A half-eaten pizza ? Piss off before I whack you one . Yeah , you 're quite right . You deserve a fresh one . I 'll go and get it at once . Family size ? Anything your tawdry heart desires . - Jellied eel perhaps ? - Nice one . Jimmy . What sort of pizza do you fancy ? SKENSHAL : Constable Frederick wasted but little time in examining her . Then asked to be shown straight to her room , where he requested solitude . For me , the seconds dragged like weeks and minutes turned to years as I waited and fretted by the fire in the drawing room . When , after what seemed an impossible time , he had not reappeared , I retraced my steps to Alice 's chamber but found it empty . Immediately , my heart turned
zone2	where I most dreaded his presence . There , by my wife 's bedside , holding her hand like a long lost relative , sat Constable Frederick . One look at the dancing fire in his eyes and the cruel smile that flickered beneath them told me all I feared to know . Immediately , and with the manner of a man conducting familiar business , the constable invited me to join him in my own drawing room . There , over a glass of my best port , he outlined my options in the starkest of terms . Either I could face a turn in court for attempting to conceal Alice 's murder , facing the certain incarceration of my wife for that crime and the equally certain ruin of my career , or , for the consideration of ? 300 , I could be assured of his silence . Such a sum , though not readily available , was not beyond my means to garner , and with my assurance that the money would be his in one week , he left , with as little emotion as
zone2	. As he went , I felt the door close , not just on my unwelcome visitor but on some better part of my old self . (
zone2	door_opens ) - Are you nuts ? - Willis seems to think so . Mike Sullivan , you are ... The rudest , most impossible , untalented journalist ... Take back untalented . The daCosta samples on the junkie 's body all match . Soap under the fingernails , hair DNA , the river water , the lot , we 've got them . SKENSHAL : Oftentimes , success and failure are like that brass knocker sea serpent , eagerly devouring a rival 's tail , they arrive together , like Siamese twins . In my case , the truth of my pen became my success . But my well-intentioned lie multiplied like cholera in the streets , as I walked at night in search of inspiration or escape . Yet , all this time , I wrote . I wrote of what I saw around me , humorous stories of bloated merchants , addled nurses , corrupt politicians , scrivening clerks
zone2	laughed . And the more they laughed , the more they flocked to my tales . Each year , I grew in celebrity . Each year , I grew more secure in my finances . And each year , the marrow of my soul shriveled and withered , hidden like a crab beneath the shell of my success . And every year , on the same night as that first fateful knock on my door , came a visit from my nemesis . Just as I had grown in fame , so the corrupt Constable Frederick had grown sleek and fat on my bribes , and I would wager on those of a good many like me . Each year , he promised a final settlement of accounts , and each year he would return with a demand for more . Big day tomorrow . Willis is going to go ape when he hears you gave the bust to Homicide . Well , let him . Anyway , even the villains hate him . Is n't that usually a compliment for a cop ? This was real contempt . It
zone2	- " Only one thing worse than a copper . " - What ? He did n't say . Jesus ! It 's like the riddle . It 's so bloody obvious . No more riddles . Willis did n't catch Baby Jimmy because he did n't want to . What ? Willis is n't a bad cop . He 's a bent one . - You 're not saying he killed her . - No . But I 've got a bloody good idea who tipped off Baby Jimmy . (

Sir Larry Olivier would 've been proud , sir . - Cheers . - Cheers . Veronica , couple more , love . Come along , do n't dawdle . Oi , you . You talking to me ? Hey , I 'm talking to you . Here we are , after you . Jimmy , are
zone2	Sorry to disappoint you , Willis . Baby Jimmy 's not here . He 's being questioned while you 're out of the way . It 's nothing to do with me . I know nothing about it . Oh , really ? So how did you know where Jimmy 's boys roughed me up ? Because I do n't remember reporting it . You shithouse , Sullivan , what 's to stop me sorting you out right now ? Nothing , apart from your internal crime boys in the office . My ragged trousered mate outside with the sawn-off is waiting to blow your balls off if you as much as show your face out there without my say so . There 's nothing worse than a smart-arsed sports reporter . You 're not as smart as you think you are . Oh , no ? Solved daCosta , did n't I ? Jimmy 's little bath trick .

And here 's to the bastard who let Willis walk . MAN 1 : He deserved that , mate . MAN 2 : All right , Mike ? MIKE : Kate ! - Kate , I can explain . - There 's no need . Where did you say you were going again ? Do me a favor , Michael , you do n't think I just floated down the Thames on a banana boat , do you ? You said we were in this together . Willis was the only one that could tell me who killed Sadie . It was just a trade off . All right then , now it 's time for you to stick to your side of the bargain . Carry your own bleeding bags . You 'll never make a porter with that attitude , and
zone2	was an accessory to murder and you let him get away . Who killed Sadie ? Forsyth . The MP ? City airport , boys . Chop , chop . Now , like you said , " Carry your own bleeding bags .

You know , I do n't mind the odd night in a bed , but it 's always good to get back to a nice wet cave . SKENSHAL : At last came blessed relief , as the black knight of death finally carried off my wife without her ever , for one moment , regaining control of her so damaged faculties . Then it seemed for a second that the pall of my misery was lifted . For surely , with the cause of my secrecy gone , not even the bloated leech that had fed on me
zone2	to continue his feasting . In latter years , to pre-empt his suspicious visits to my home , I would arrange with a local publican , a shrewd man who knew how to close his mouth for a shilling and keep it closed , to have access to his silent hostelry in the hours of darkness . He assumed I knew that this was for some furtive carnal assignation that did not befit a celebrated writer , and I did not disabuse him of such an agreeable illusion . The real meeting was always more loathsome . I must be the invisible woman . She 's seen everyone apart from me . I do n't think anybody would think that , love . Allow me . Veronica , you got a minute , love ? VERONICA : What can I get you ? Dry white wine , please , and whatever the gentleman 's having . No , I 'm fine . You do n't have to do that .

Just an old manuscript , that 's all . I never find time to read these days . - Busy at work ? - Just a secretary . - You ? - Journalist . Really ? That must be interesting . Well , it has been the last couple of weeks , I must admit . So , Mike Sullivan . You are ? Margot . So , what shall we drink to , absent friends ? What about new friends ? - Cheers . - Cheers . I was walking , right , and the bullets start flying all around me , I 'm thinking , " Mikey boy , ( SEXPLAYING ) " now you 're really in it . Now you 've got some problems .

zone2	get up again . I 've got a cab outside . If you finish your drink , I can give you a lift . Sweet dreams . SKENSHAL : Give me back my book . MIKE : You 're Charles Dickens . What 's in a name ? Why are you following me ? I think you 'll find you followed me . How could I do that ? You 're dead . Not very good with funerals , are you ? Why did you kill Sadie ? You 've been reading too many books . ( CRAZYPLAYING ) KATE : Mike , darling , are you awake ? Listen , I 'm really sorry about the drink ... Mike ? All I remember is I was in the pub with Miss Gorgeous , then whammo , wake up with lipstick all over me chopper , and a goodbye note from Kate . Well , it must have seemed a little untoward , but you told her you were drugged . What , a passing nympho drugs me , covered me from head to toe in love bites , and
zone2	. - The idea is a bit of a stretch , I admit , but ... - What ? - It 's true . I just want her back . You , sir , must win her back . You must show her that the harpy was after your notes , not your crown jewels . I had this awful dream last night about Dickens and some funeral . What did I miss at Sadie 's ? Retrace your steps . That 's what I do . She had an old flame who had a pub in the East End . Henry the Hood . MIKE : Harry the Hat . The famous hat . Sadie looks great . She would n't marry me . I thought it was ' cause I was skint . I stopped backing the horses , started to save , 20 large . She still said no ? It was n't about the readies . She could see I was well gutted . So she told me about this place in South East London , said I should buy it . What ? A pub
zone2	arse end of Greenwich . I thought she was taking the piss . Why was she so keen ? Would n't say . Just told me to trust her and put every penny I 've got into it . Three weeks after I bought the place , they started building the Millennium Dome next door . " The Department of Transport today ended weeks of speculation " by naming Greenwich as the location for the dome , " the country 's flagship building project . " Property prices went through the roof . Did you ever ask her how she knew all this ? ' Course I bloody did . She told me to keep it under me hat . " The announcement was made " by Junior Minister for Transport , Mr . Alistair Forsyth , MP . " Mr . Sullivan . I 'm going to give you a few minutes . I have to get back to the House for question time . Question one . What 's a drunk junior minister doing blabbing to a pub landlady about the new site for the Millennium Dome ,
zone2	, and if you print it , I 'll sue you from here to eternity . Will you ? Or will you have me bumped off like all the others ? I do n't know what you 're talking about . I suppose you 've never heard of Tamron , either ? That 's right . The firm that built half the new East End . The construction firm you had 20,000 shares in . I sold them years ago . Give me a bit of credit , Mr . Forsyth . You sold them to your wife , did n't you ? And when they started getting government contracts , the shares tripled in value . Is that why you killed Sadie ? Was she going to talk ? ( SCREAMING ) Sadie Miller was my friend . Prove it . Who killed her ? The pub , Mr . Sullivan . The pub killed her . What does that mean ? Tell me , Mr . Sullivan , have you never done anything you regretted ? I would arrive at 2:00 in the morning , let myself in
zone2	on a table the hundreds of pounds destined for the constable 's ample pockets . He would arrive at half past the hour and count his money noisily and laboriously , more to savor my torment than in the expectation of short change . Each year , he would inquire of the health of my wife like an old family friend , and each year , I would answer that she was much the same . But this year , oh , joy of joys , I told him as he thumbed and slavered over my banknotes that she was no more , and from that time forth , my payments to him were at an end . He paused for the briefest of moments , as if I had made him stumble in his counting . Then he recommenced with his sordid thumbing , saying as he did so that if I failed to pay up , he had enough evidence to put me in the dock for Alice 's murder , and that the death of my wife was of no consequence . ROBERTS : The union go-slow
zone2	to meet the new deadline is not an option . Fix it . SADIE : Despite your increased offer , I have no intentions of selling my pub . It is not for sale now or in the future . Yours sincerely , Sadie Miller . ROBERTS : Tamron has now purchased the adjoining properties to your pub and have offered you a very full price . In order to reach agreement , I am authorized to increase our bid . This will be our final offer . ( THUDDING ) Do n't do that unless you want to go to prison . I 'm calling the police . Five to 10 , Holloway , accessory to murder . Murder ? What murder ? I got you drunk and made you look like a git in front of your girlfriend , that 's all . Did n't he tell you ? Remember the pub where you spiked my drinks ? Landlady got her head smashed in because she would n't sell to your boss . They 've got those ankle bracelets in Holloway , nice big heavy one's . -
zone2	did Tamron want with a cheesy pub in Limehouse ? Well , they own virtually everything on that stretch of the river . They started buying it up on the QT about two months ago . - Why ? - Search me . They 've been paying way over the odds . Your friend was about the only one who did n't bite their hand off to accept . What about the steward that got killed on the building site ? I do n't know . All I know is that Roberts started pushing them to speed up about the same time as they started buying up Limehouse . Thank you , Margot . You 've been very revealing . Not half as revealing as you were . And the name 's Tiffany , actually . Well , whatever your name is , you 're going to do one more thing for me . Yeah ? Are you going to make me ? (
zone2	phone_ringing ) - KATE : Press office . - Kate , do n't hang up . I 've got somebody here who wants to talk to
zone2	That 's an " L . " Not very promising . Is that why you 're 50 points ahead , darling ? I just think of you . Weasel . On a double word score . I was the victim . Margot told you that . Poor lamb . Miserable cow was only out to save her own skin . Anyway , I thought you said her name was Tiffany . What 's in a name ? An " R . " That spells Cedric . What about " R " for Roberts ? You going to the police or are you going to let him go , too ? What are you doing , you cheat ? What 's in a name ? MIKE : Charles Dickens . It 's me , the man with the page . It 's also in the middle of the bloody night ! Only it was n't a page . It was the whole novel . And that 's the story . It 's remarkable . Come here . There , there , there , there . Beautiful , is n't she ?
zone2	. She 's the younger sister of Dickens ' wife . She came to live with them , in this house , just after they were married . Alice . She died very young . Dickens never really recovered . I have a letter of his , years later , asking to be buried in the same grave as her . That 's odd . Well , when she died , he kept her clothes . Used to spread them out on the bed in the shape of a person . You said the book could answer our question . Yeah . You see , Dickens wrote nearly every day of his life except for one particular period when he stopped . It was the six months after Mary Hogarth 's death . How did she die ? Heart failure , after a night at the theater with Charles Dickens . Tiffany , hurry up , you 're late . She wo n't be coming . She got a promotion . She works for me now . Well , I 'd hardly call that a step up . Do n't
zone2	So , where do you want to start ? A letter to Sadie Miller , trying to buy her out , or maybe a threatening letter to your site manager at Docklands telling him to finish the building early ? Tiffany , as you 've probably realized , is an airhead . Those letters prove nothing . So I wanted to buy a pub , does n't make me a criminal . It 's called good business . And what 's it called when you do business based on inside information from a government minister ? Poor old Forsyth , lovely bloke , but loves a drink . Shame he 's in no shape to comment , is n't it ? It 's funny , people have a habit of expiring around you . I 'm just misunderstood . Still , I could use a good PR like you , on retainer , say , 100 grand ? 100 grand . The last time someone made me an offer like that , she had a view just like yours . Take a good look . If I was to take
zone2	know everything that 's been going on . My pleasure . But if you change your mind , I 'll deny everything . Your word against mine . Obviously . See that ? Lovely is n't it ? That 's prime real estate . Now , imagine if it was cheap land , and imagine if someone wanted to build the Olympic Village right on top of it . And imagine if you had a drunken minister telling his mates the location before it was announced . Your mate Sadie had been listening to Forsyth 's drunken ramblings for years . She could 've made a killing . Is that what you was doing , Mr . Roberts ? Making a killing . It was unfortunate . It was an accident . And if I was to take you up on your offer , that 's what I 'd end up as , would n't I ? Your next accident . You print one word based on a conversation that never happened and I will destroy you in court . Well , we 're being watched . - Did you
zone2	get this back to the boys . - Come on . Why the hell did you drag me down here ? I told you I want the book . So let 's go to the office and talk . Dickens ' old manor , very appropriate . So what do you want ? Your job back ? That promotion to the crime desk ? Just think about it , Roberta , the only publisher in the world able to serialize the new Dickens novel . Think of all those sales , that lovely money . One million . But I want exclusive rights . And I want you to print that you 'll never interfere with the editorial judgment of your journalists again . - Front page . - Oh , no , no , no , no , no . Not for a million novels . Forget it . Pity . One man 's loss ... I told my friend over there he could have the book if you did n't want it . Who the hell is that weirdo ? The Riddle by Charles Dickens . Chapter ,

Somebody that publishes a million newspapers a day does n't grasp the concept of a photocopy . All 's well that ends well , eh ? Dwayne ! What happened to the injuries ? He made a remarkable recovery . Wonderful health plan our company provides . MIKE : You bastard . Now , now . That 's no way to speak to a cripple . Right , you lot , down on your knees . You , too , Steptoe . Join your friends . Would somebody mind telling me what is going on ? Mr . Roberts . Tamron construction . Tamron ? Do you know who I am ? Of course I do . We spoke on the phone , remember ? You were kind enough to sack a nosey journalist in return for a promise of more ad money . Only problem is ,

I bet he got you to do all the finishing . - And your mate Mickey , as well ... - Shut up ! That was an accident . And Sadie ? Was she an accident , too ? All she had to do was sign a bit of paper . But she would n't . Not our Sadie . Shoot him . SKENSHAL : What 's in a name ? TRAMP : Bill ? Bill Sikes . It 's me . " Just flesh and blood , Bill , " but , oh , such flesh . " And so much blood .

I think this is yours , Mr . Dickens . The deed that followed , though it took not a minute , had been 30 years in my mind . I lifted a wall ornament , a small rusting anchor from a long drowned ship , walked silently up behind my tormentor and with blow after blow to his skull snuffed out his miserable life . So much blood . Opening the window , I saw that the

Three weeks later , after his bloated body had drifted many times up and down the river with the eddying tide , as if on one final patrol of his earthly domain , he was discovered and recognized by his clothing . The coroner , faced with decaying carrion , recorded an open verdict , and the case was no sooner open than , like the slamming of that old oak door , it was shut . Forever .

Uh , I have to get dressed . They even change the gauge . You know , it 's interesting , honey , the Chinese did n't want the Russians to invade , so they made their tracks narrower . Uh , you know , the Russian gauge ... 5.6 feet , which is , like , three inches wider than the Chinese , so these Chinese wheels got ta go . Where 'd they come from ? I do n't know . Some machine tool factory in Moscow , I suppose . No , them ... our new

We 're gon na get you some vodka . So , how was Customs ? Oh , jeez ! You know , they really gave us a bit of a hard time , Carlos . What , you two ? No way . Yeah , well , they were suspicious of our passports . - What ? - May I see them , please ? Sure . Okay . This is why , Roy . Look . They 're new . Brand-new . A new passport is easy to forge . There are fewer stamps and visas to copy . Hold
zone2	just got those . Hold on . Let me show you mine . This is the real McCoy . - Oh . - See ? - Well used . - Yeah . They 're not accustomed to see new passports . What 's Canada like ? I always wanted ... Let me tell you the secret to getting through Customs and across borders . Do n't stand out . You think it 's obvious that we 're Americans ? Nah ... Well , she definitely looks American . So you 've done this trip before ? S ? . Train 's cheaper than plane . I do n't like the cold , but my ... Huh ? The colder , the better , huh ? - You know ? - S ? . If she loves cold , she 'd love Iowa , ' cause it gets cold there . Here they are .

You know , plant a root ? So , uh , you were helping kids in China ? Yes

Like what ? You know , lending a helping hand and helping someone who 's down . Roy 's real good like that . He 's ... He 's good with people . Da , da , da ! He seems like he would be . Oh , God . Okay . Show ' em . Look at this . Oh ! A tiger attack him in Habarask . There are tigers in Russia ? A lot of Siberian tigers . He hunts them . Tony the Tiger attack me . Hey , look at this .

Do you mind if I take a look ? Wow ! They 're beautiful . Look at this one . You must sell them for much money . - Do n't you ? - No , I do n't sell them . No ? Why not ? It 's more of just a hobby for now . " For now . " I do n't know . I might do a book someday . I do n't know . I want to show you something . Do n't want those strange Polacks looking in and getting ideas . Wow . No , not this one . This one . This is my favorite . You see , all the others are smiling , and this one is so sad . I love these things . See ? It 's sandalwood . These are one of a
zone2	for these in Amsterdam . Is it legal ... reselling them ? Yeah . I mean , little packages to Customs now and then , but it 's legal . They are Matryoshkas . That means " mother .

zone2	So who said that ? - What ? " Kill all my demons , and my angels might die , too . " Tennessee Williams said it . I like it . Yeah ? I saw you have a journal . Are you a writer ? - No . - No ? No . It 's more like a travel diary . Uh-huh . Well , I bet you got some good stories . I sure did . Yeah . None of them I 'm too proud of . I left home when I was 16 . Maybe for the same reasons as you . I do n't know . Spun my wheels into my late 20s . Never spent more than a week in one place . No . Wait . I 'm wrong . There was jail in Memphis for nine days , and , uh , detox . That was two weeks , I think . This was all pre-Roy , of course . So , how 'd you two meet ? How 'd we meet ? Well , Roy likes to say we met by accident
zone2	truck head-on , going 40 miles an hour . - Beautiful , huh ? - I saw many like that in Rajasthan . - Where 's , uh ... - India . Oh , wow . You 've been pretty much everywhere , huh ? Life is a journey , right ? Not a destination . I like that . That sounds like something Jess would say . - Really ? - Yeah . She 's still a bit ... I do n't know . What 's the word ? Restless . Yeah . Okay . So , this trip ... the Trans-Siberian ... it was her idea . No , that was me . You see , we never travel anywhere , and , so , when the church gave us this chance , I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to impress her with a big adventure . You know , make her happy . She seems happy to me . Well , tell you the truth , Carlos , we 've been having problems lately ... marital problems . Oh . I 'm sorry to hear
zone2	a bit safe sometimes . Before I met Jess , I thought I was the wild one . I 'm not sure she expected to end up with a hardware store owner , you know , much less one with a train set in his basement , but ... I love her so . Oh , Carlos , you got ta check out this boiler . What a beauty . Is n't she gorgeous ? He came to the hospital every day . There was no one else . I pretty much pissed off everyone else in my life by that point . He said something to me one day I 'll never forget . He said , " No matter what your aim " ... No . Wait . " No matter what your dream in life , no matter what your goal , keep your eye upon the doughnut and not upon the hole . " What 's that supposed to mean ? I do n't know , but it 's so Roy . No , I guess it 's like ... You know , if you ...
zone2	amazing things in your life . Before we met , I was a bit too focused on the negative . No , I 'm not saying settling down solves everything , you know ? It 's ... Roy and I are so different in many ways . He wants kids , for instance . A family , you know ? I mean , I do , too . Of course I do , too . It 's just ... It 's ... It 's just such a huge thing to ... Plant a root ? Yeah . I want a family . But I 'd get it right , you know ? There 's this place in Vancouver on a lake ... this cottage . It 's got this long wooden dock that you can go out and sit on . Surrounded by the mountains , and it 's quiet . No one else is around . Sounds nice . Is it a family place ? Yeah , my grandfather 's . Well , he actually sold it to pay for his trips to Reno . I 'm gon na
zone2	. Sounds expensive . Yeah , I 'm working on it . With Carlos ? I 'm sorry . That was none of my business . We should get back on . Yeah . Hey , it was good talking to you , Abby . Yeah , you , too . Yeah . Thanks . Roy ? You there ? Excuse me . Have you seen my husband ? You ca n't keep doing that . - We have five more days before ... - Roy 's gone . What ? I just looked up and down the whole train . He 's not on it . - Well ... Here . Sit down . - Did n't he get back on with you ? No . Oh , shit ! We looked at the old trains . Then I left to get some food . Maybe he did n't hear the bell . What am I going to do ? He 's got to be here somewhere . - He 's not . - I 'm sure he 's fine . We 'll just have to ask around .
zone2	put him on next train . You wait at station . So when 's the next train ? There are delays . Police are checking all trains from Shtatova into Sibirska . Checking trains ? Da . Drugs . Okay , so when 's the next train ? - Zavtra . - Zavtra ? Tomorrow . It 'll be okay . I mean , um , we 'll ... - I guess . - We ca n't really do anything else about it . Hey , Jessie , we 're gon na get off and wait with you . Oh , no . Really , you do n't have to do that . Please . We will die from train food . A vegetable will be nice , huh ? We 've been at this a lot longer than you . It 's just not safe for a woman by herself . Ulyanovsk . Ulyanovsk , five minutes . Okay ? Okay , let 's go . - You need some help ? - No , it 's okay . Okay . Come on , girls . Hotel . Very

It 's happened many , many times with tourists . This is Russia . Everything okay ? He does n't know a thing . Just that the first train from Irkyutsk gets in at noon . I 'm sure he 's on it . - I 'm sure he 's fine . - Yeah . Yeah , I know . Hey , hey , hey . Let 's not worry about Roy , okay ? - Carlos . - I 'm sorry ? Roy 's machote , eh ? A big man .

El lobo feroz ? The Big Bad Wolf ? You 're irresponsible . You understand ? No . Roy told me about your bad girl past . Why this trip , Jessie ? I understand Roy . He likes choo-choo trains . But you ? Why are you here ? What are you looking for ? A little bit of excitement ? Like you had before when you were the chica mala ? And there was nothing to hold you down . No compromise . When life was just ... sensaci ? n . Man , I sure wish I 'd met you back in the day . ? S ? ? Yeah . Nothing cleared the head back then better than a good , pointless fuck . I 'm tired . I 'm turning in . Buenas noches . - Guess what .

I was able to get a hotel . But now they 're saying I wo n't get in until 4:30 . - 4:30 ? That late ? - Well , I 'm not complaining .

But there 's still two days to see the Red Square , and the Kremlin and the ... Well , you really did n't sleep a wink , did ya ? Was it that bad ? - What ? - Your hotel . Sweetie , I swear to you . Mine was like a gulag . And you know the stock room in the basement at the store ? It was half that size . No windows and ... oh , here we go ! And , oh , this is the best part . Okay ? The phone rings 3:00 in the morning . It 's reception asking , " Do you want a prostitute ? " I mean , apparently it 's normal
zone2	I mean , I ... she was ... good at what she did . Just kidding you . Sweetie ? You all right ? You ... you sure you 're okay , sweetie ? Yeah . Yeah . I am now . Oh , there he is . - Where you been , " tabarish " ? - Tovarich . - Ah , tovarich , tovarich . - You must be Jessie . Yeah , oh , this is Elia Grinko .

zone2	master and Elia appears out of nowhere and starts translating . Your husband is lucky guy . His English is excellent , do n't you think , honey ? My son encouraged me . He ... he liked your country . He was going to be in diplomatic service . Well , hold on there , Elia . Can policemen drink while on duty ? Well , we wo n't tell my boss , hey ? No , thanks . Do n't be shy . - You 're a cop . - A detective , Jess . Da . With FSKN , like your Bureau of Narcotics . Elia is on his way to a big conference in Moscow all the way from Vladivostok . In Soviet days , official like me would get plane ticket first class . Now , seven days on train . - Na Zdorovie - Na Zdorovie Hold on there , Elia . Do n't tell me that you miss the U.S.S . R ? I mean , the U.S.S.R . was a dark , evil empire . Maybe so . But then we were
zone2	people dying in the light . Which is better ? When it was U.S.S.R . , man lived to age 65 years . Now it is 58 years . I know this fact very well . I am 58 . In Russia now we say there are only two kinds of people ... those who leave in private jet , those who leave in coffin . Which are you ? I am too old to leave . Just do my job . Which is catching the bad guys , huh , Elia ? Right , Roy . Well , who are they ? Who are the bad guys ? Ten years ago , it was easy . Drivers bring heroin from Kabul in back of truck . We catch them , so they get smart . They add special chemical to heroin , mold it into objects ... souvenirs , handicrafts , small toys . They pay people ... mules , I think you call them ... who can travel easily with drugs . They use students , old babushkas . People who look innocent , but are really not
zone2	Jess , Abby and ... ahem ... shoot , what was his name ? The Spaniard . Carlos . The backpackers you told me about who shared your cabin . Yes , Abby and Carlos . Do you think they could have been mules ? Why , the past year , this line has become major traffic route . You know , Elia , now that I think about it , this couple seemed to know an awful lot about forging passports and sneaking over borders and whatnot . This Abby and Carlos . I mean , at least that 's what they said their names were . This couple ... did they seem suspicious to you , Jessie ? No , just young . And they were going where , Moscow ? They never said . So you left them on the train when you got off in Ulyanovsk ? Yeah . Well , you feeling better ? Yeah . Oh , good . You 're lucky you did n't have that Russian vodka . Hmm . In the end you 're lucky you 're not drinking , you

It 's okay . - Let go . - Okay . - He 's got it . - Thank you . She 's a headstrong woman . You know how that goes . Hey , how many days to Moscow , Elia ? Three more days , Roy . Whoo ! Amazing . You want to stay on train forever . Well , as long as possible ... - Guess what . - What ? Our shower is broken . They found Roy . Keys on the table , okay ? " Spokonya Noche . " Spokoinoi . Spokoinoi
zone2	Sweetie , can you hit the lights ? I have my eye things on . # Who 's peeking out from under the stairway # # Calling a name that 's lighter than air # # Who 's yelling down , oh give me a rainbow # # Everyone knows it 's Windy # # Who 's tripping down the streets of the city # # Smiling at everybody she sees # # And Windy has stormy eyes # # That flash at the sound of lies # # And Windy has wings to fly # # Above the clouds # # Above the clouds # # Who 's tripping down the streets of the city # # Smiling at everybody she sees # No , not this one . This one . All the others are smiling . This one is so sad . # And Windy has stormy eyes # # That flash at the sound of lies # # And Windy has wings to fly # The toilet 's clogged . You gon na fix it ? It was an accident . # And Windy has wings
zone2	photos , okay ? I 'll keep an eye on ya . I 'll be fine . Oh , ho , ho , no . I 'm not making the same mistake twice . Hey . Ah , Jessie . Taking some pictures , I see . I am not photographer but ... I suggest that side of platform . That looks heavy . Please allow me . - Oh , no . It 's not . It 's fine . - Take my tea . Now , there is very nice picture . Bright colors , babushkas . Russian faces . Take , take , take . Take more ! I believe we have time . Why do you wear it if it does n't work ? It was my son 's . I gave it to him when he graduated university . He died of bone cancer . Oh , I 'm very sorry . Ah . To live life is not always to walk through a meadow , eh ? Still we find ways to survive . My colleagues in Karasuk ask ... they searched the Vostok
zone2	could not find Carlos and Abby . Maybe they got off somewhere between ? Maybe . - Ah , my phone . - I got it now . Thanks . Da . Jessie . This is my colleague , Kolzak Yushenkov . He 's also detective . We are traveling together . Right . Jessie , would you come with us , please ? My husband 'll wonder where I am . He knows you can not be far . There are few places one can hide on this train . No ? This Carlos and Abby ... perhaps they got off train with you in Ulyanovsk ? - No . - No ? You are certain ? In Russia , we have expression ... " With lies you may go ahead in the world , but you may never go back . " You understand this , Jessie ? I have spoken with police in Ulyanovsk . They have spoken with manager of hotel . This witness saw you having dinner with the Spaniard . Jess ? You okay ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm fine
zone2	doing in your camera bag ? Did you buy ' em ? No ? Wh ... Where 'd they come from ? Carlos . Carlos ? - Yeah . - He gave these to you ? - Yeah . - Huh . Jess ? - No . He didn't . - Jess . Oh , God ! It 's okay , baby . It 's okay . It 's okay . Heroin . Oh , Lord . How did Carlos get a doll into your bag ? He came into my room . I let him . His shower was n't working . He wanted to use mine . So I left the room and saw police searching the hotel . Carlos must have seen them , too . I think he got scared and that must have been when he ... did it . What then ? I went to the lobby and I waited for a call from Roy . It was there that I saw the two of them leave and go off together . Jessie ... why did you tell me they did not get off
zone2	I got scared for Abby . I got to know Abby . She 's a good girl , okay . So when you asked me those questions , I froze . I did n't want anything to happen to her because of what Carlos did . She 's not part of it . She did n't even know Carlos had the dolls . How do you know this ? He told me . He showed me the dolls . When you were alone with him ? Yes . And later , when I found the dolls in my bag ... She got ... She panicked , Elia . You just told her about how the smugglers operate and she got scared and ... It can happen to anyone . Da . Fear can drive one to irrational acts . In Russia , we know this very well . Our history is a history of irrational acts . So ... that 's it ? Mmm , apart from , I 'm afraid , one formality . Ahh . I was right . Very beautiful . Is it okay ? Yeah .
zone2	? First , we must find them , Roy . Hey , Carlos . Yee-heel Ah , this is very nice one . This is Ulyanovsk ? Which church ? I ... I did n't get the name . Oh , this is very nice . - Like ... - Hey , Carlos . The Russian symbol , no ? We can take care of that . I am very sorry for inconvenience . We will arrive in Moscow tomorrow . I will stay in Kolzak 's cabin tonight . - Spokoinoi nochn . - " Spokoinya noch . " - Good night ... " Spokoinoi nochn . " - " Sakoinoi noche . " I 'm sorry . Jess , I love you . That means we should be able to tell each other everything . No secrets . Yee-heel You put that in your book ! Guess who 's not at her station for once ? Of course there 's no milk or sugar . Huh . Well , at least she turned off the music . Hey . We did the right thing , okay ? Yeah
zone2	to go get you some sugar from the dining car ? That 'd be sweet . Okay . Aaah ! Uhh . - Ohh . - Give me your hand ! I got ya ! Aah . You 're okay . You 're okay . Elia . Wait . What is going on here ? What ... There are some problems with your wife 's story . Elia ... where are the other cars ? Who the hell are you ? Kolzak . Roy , Jessie , it is best to sit . Your wife was seen leaving Ulyanovsk on a bus with the Spaniard . Now perhaps your wife can tell us ... where is Carlos ? Hmm ? Hmm ? Da . It seems , Roy , your wife has problems with the truth . Do n't tell me about my wife . I know about my wife . Who are you ? Who are you ? I am Detective Elia Grinko , Narcotic Division . - And this is ... - Bullshit ! You 're not a Detective .

zone2	4054650 April , 25th 1872 The day I was born . But as I would come to find out a far more meaning full event took place on that day . An events they would change many lives forever . About the mile and half outside of the small mining town , Shiloh Falls a down on his luck , named Dalton Tager . He was about to learn the meaning of the word , cursed . - You got a lady 's blather ! - Do n't talk ! Make me stop ! We just want the money ! Now , do n't you be no hero ! - Hey , what are you doing ? - His doing like he was told . - Now is your turn . - That 's Dalton right there ! Turn out , he was convinced by his older brother , Wyatt , that robben the pay-roll waggon was the fastest way to have a heaven on earth . Seems Dalton would fallow Waytt anywhere . Unfortunately , heaven was the last thing they would found today . So , you come over here and open this pay-roll box and free yourself
zone2	n't do that . - You boys , a maken a mistake . - What you said ? I sware on oaht . The content to that box 's thing not meant to this world . Unlocked ! No ! Maybe we can shoot the lock . Daltone , you just hush up . We got the boys who can open right here . Pete ? Pete ? Pete ? Hold it ! You ! Come over and unlock this box ! Hey ! It 's over here ! He got the key . All right ! Do n't ... open it ! Come on ! You did n't have to shoot him ! What the hell ... Wyatt ... Hey ! - Hey ! They say , when the man dies , if he was a good man his spirit moved on to a better place . They say , it 's a place of peace and everlasting happiness . Of course , no one knows for sure . But some folks ... well , I guess they just believe . Now me , I never used to gived
zone2	my daddy it been grumen me for a life did n't allowe for that tap a thing . Facing your horse maybe , facing your weapon . But , for a Texas 's ranger like my father , well , sadly that was just about all to believe he could afford . And that was something that was never gon na change . What I tell you about this ? This is just a sketch . You 're a deputy ranger , not an artist . Let 's get moving ! Nearly 20 years at past since the date Dalton Tager play witness to the bizare death of his brother Wyatt and you might think that be enough to scare a man dissant , but not old Dalton . He just tap it all inside and let it zimmer . Damn it ! Here you go ! So , boss , as really as much you said it is ? Could be more ! And you sure still there ? No reason for to be found . So , as soon us we help you find this man use looking
zone2	, right ? So what I said ! What 's so funny ? Well , I was just thinking about , how the Vorren 's face must look like , if he figured we do n't busted out . He must been hited boy ! Now , is turn in ! Temptation is a powerful thing . You see , Dalton has been a guest at the Austin State penitentiary . Any convince will in breaks here that if they helped them to bust from there will be something shineing waiting from at the other side . But Dalton haden let this men all the way to back the Shadow Falls to fill their pockets . Dalton was on a different path . Dalton want it revenge . Our preacher used to say , honor die father . But when your father is a law man , those words take a hole new meaning . That 's not far ! Let 's go ! So , when I start to having a strange feeling that those outlaws want the only one what we chasing , Well ... I just kept
zone2	. Why is we stopen ? This way to go is ? " Come over and unlock this box ! " You 're OK , boss ? - " Maybe we can shut the lock ? " - Good luck ! " You did n't have to shut him ! " You know , I was thinking ... what if ai n't here ? It 's here ! What if ai n't ? We did n't ride all that way for nothing . Got to keep riding ! I still thinking it was miracle that my daddy was able to track those fellows down at all , but as it was , we allready circled around and it was only a matter of time before things came to a head . Good afternoon ! I thought we only out here . No man 's ever alone on the trail . And that the truth ! What 's with him ? Ruff knife ! Where you all headed ? I do n't believe I got your names . John ! I 'm Sam ! Hear you , boy ! He 's
zone2	, Willy , let 's get out from here . Sam ! Dad ! You left me there ! What 's wrong with you ? You knew who they were . I did n't ! They nearly killed us . - I 'm sorry ! - Do you wan na die ? I got scared , dad . You got to stand and face it what is in front of you or you 'll always be runing . What the number one rule I told you a thousand times ? Do n't ever let your guard down ! Ever ! Now , come on ! Let 's go ! We almost got them ! I said , let 's go ! No ! What ? You 're always tell me what I can and ca n't do ! What I 'll gon na be !

I suppose if my daddy not knock me around like that maybe I would had enough wits to figure it out why all those luds gray stones had my birthday 's on . But as it was , I had others things to worried about . At since the boys stemmel down to the crossroads and just like water been spell to the ground old Dalton was fixen to do the thing they could never been undone .

Who are you ? Edward Jones ! And this is my daughter Mary . Mam ? You got any food , are you ? We are starving ! I got some turkey ! - It 's all right ! - Try it ! I 'm sorry ! It 's not your fault !

That 's all just keep our head . Sam , check your gun . You , put that thing down ! Wasting your time ! The bullets ca n't kill him ! How do you know that ? Because I seen him before ! On the trail ... twenty years ago . Me and my brother was robben a payroll coach . Feller up there standing guard only thing was but not gold in that box , like we saw , as some sort of I do n't know , artifacts or something . Big burial cross , trinkets ... So , they was grave robben ? That 's right ! And as soon as he unlocked and open it up he was different . His eyes ... and he did that to my brother . What about you ? How did you escape it ?

Spirit ? Your soul ! Well , I do n't know nothing about that but I do know this that thing ai n't aged just single day since he kill my brother . The spirits ... I think they give him power .

Just mean you ai n't look hard enough . Look , I 'm telling you , there is no way out . No way out , ha ? You kill that monster that 's your way out . That we gon na do . Sam , you guard this two ! Edward , you and I gon na go
zone2	for few minutes , dear ? You gon na need help ! - Untie me ! - No ! Where the hell I gon na go ? Where 're the horses ? Like I said , animals do n't come here .

Her daddy knows where we are . Where else can we go ? Let 's takes turns keeping guard ! I go first ! So , let it was , we were trap like squirrels in the cage . And that soul collector feller was pick it us off one by one . I never seen my father scare of anything on this world but there comes a time for every man when he realize that he just might no have all the answers . Is not your time yet ! I do n't sleep ! Where 's you learn shut that bow and arrow ? As a kid , playing cowboys and indians . I was always indian . It 's a good thing ! Did n't think so at that time . My brother , Wyatt , he was like a God to

zone2	no way out like little lambs being prepare for sacrifice . And now my father was getting set for a fight that he had almost no chance a wining . I wanted to stop him but I had a new responsibility . So , I can only watch when they went off . Like the good book says : be strong that you not be servant . Quit yourself like a man and fight . It 's quiet ! I do n't trust quiet ! Niether do I ! Let 's draw them out ! Briggs , look out ! No , no , no ... Shot him ! Shot him ! Dalton , what the hell you 're doing ? Shot him , for God sake !

You wan na just stay put ? No ! Me neither ! There 's nothing you
zone2	? Was it over ! Did I just watch is my father pass from this life to the next ? Did his spirit move it on to that ever lasting happines ? I like to think it did ! It 's over ! I set that stone into the ground to mark my father 's place . To mark this day , April , 25th 1892 . the day my daddy died and the day is simple miracle gave a young boy the courage to delivered to the people of Siloh Falls . The day that I , Samuel Endrew Gaffny , became a man .
zone2	3423744 This is it . I 'm standing on the very spot where many Christians believe the world will come to an end . It 's called Megiddo . And it 's the place that the Book of Revelation says Jesus Christ will come down to to end the world and save the people who believe in him . Now when Revelations was written , only God had the capacity to end the world , but now man does too , because unfortunately , before man figured out how to be rational or peaceful , he figured out nuclear weapons and how to pollute on a catastrophic scale . And if it 's one thing I hate more than prophecy , it 's self-fulfilling prophecy . Sometimes in your search for happiness , you ponder the meaning of your life . Who am I ? How did I come to be ? Death , and then what ? I certainly honestly believe religion is detrimental to the progress of humanity . You know , it 's just selling an invisible product . It 's too easy . These questions about what happens when you die , they so freak people
zone2	cling to it . You know , things that they know ca n't be true , people who are otherwise so rational about everything else , and then they believe that on Sunday they 're drinking the blood of a 2,000-year-old God . I ca n't ... that 's a dissonance in my head . I ca n't ... I have to find out . I just have to find out . I have to try . This is the Mount of Olives . This is Jesus 's footprints . We 're here freezing our ass off . Is there anybody on the stage that - does not believe in evolution ? - Yeah . Hurry hurry hurry . - I like my hat . - You look good too . Welcome to Bible Country ! " Birthplace of the Virgin Mary " ? I believe that God wants everybody to be free . That 's what I believe , and that 's one part of my foreign policy . Bill , watch out . Boy , do I feel cheap . I want to thank God for just blessing
zone2	God . Thank you , Jesus ! You need a Holy Ghost enema right up your rear end ! The archives are there on the fifth floor where you see the curtains . Yeah , put that away now . Put that away . If you look at my stand-up from like the ' 80s ... that era ... early ' 90s , I talked about religion , but I 'm not ever questioning God . I 'm just making fun about things in the religion ... circumcision . Circumcision ... I mean , I would 've loved to have been there for the first people to hear about this . We 're used to it now , but you know , I mean , I 'm sure when Moses came down with this idea , there had to be one guy going , " Let me get this straight . " It was just a gentle poking fun at Him . It 's almost like I 'm roasting Him . My mother is Jewish and my father is Catholic . That is the truth . I was raised Catholic
zone2	out even in the Catholic system . I 'll give you an example . We used to go into confession and I would bring a lawyer in with me . You know . Bless me , Father , for I have sinned . I think you know Mr . Cohen . So let me get out some pictures . There 's me . We were n't brought up Jewish . I did n't even know we had that side , so it was very Catholic . We went to church every Sunday , but I would n't take off the gun and really when I think back , it was n't relevant to my life . Superman was relevant and baseball . We had this family where one person was Jewish and the other three were Catholic . Now there it says " A Sunday noon , fall ' 66 , " so we must 've just gotten back from church , ' cause I 'm in a red suit and you 're choking the dog . And I guess we got home from church and took a picture with
zone2	" Why did n't you go to church ? " Mom ... what church do we belong to ? I do n't remember this ever coming up . Of course you did n't go to church with us . No , we never had a family discussion about it , never . We never had a family discussion about that . Every family is dysfunctional . So you thought even this , which was n't your religion , was better than no religion . Well , even this only told you good things ... I thought . But it 's just so shamelessly invented as they go along . - We can say that now . - Was anyone ... When we quit the church , I was 13 , and I was of course thrilled , but not for any ideological reason . I was just thrilled ' cause I hated church . It scared me . It was boring . I had to get up on Sunday . I was 13 . I would 've worshiped anything that could 've allowed me to masturbate even more than I
zone2	would have definitely worshipped . Why do you remember Dad stopped going to church ? We used birth control , and the church frowned on birth control . That was the biggest sin - you could ever commit . - Right , that would ... I think that was possibly ... he never said it to me . And he never went back . None of us ever did . So now that we do n't believe , where did ... Nobody said we do n't believe . We do n't believe in Catholicism . Right , but what do we believe in now ? Come on . You 're my mother , instruct me . I do n't know the answer to that . That 's my answer . We 'll take some back roads to see - some interesting stuff out here . - Take some back roads . We are heading toward Raleigh , right ? Oh , yeah , man , ca n't you feel it ? Do I stand up here ? So as I was going here , I just jotted down a few
zone2	bothered by many things that are in Christianity that are not in the Bible ? Like original sin . Immaculate conception . The virgin birth is only in two of the Gospels ... popes . Are you worried that these things came not from the founders , the people that wrote this book , but from ... and this is indisputable ... but from men , from human beings who came after ? And when I say men , I mean people with penises . If you wan na go back to scientific proof , I think it was determined the shroud or whatever that was went around a while back ... I did n't get involved . - Shroud of Turin ? - They took blood samples from it , and it was female blood with a male figure . Okay , the only possible way that could happen was that the Holy Ghost impregnated Mary because it would 've been female blood because it would 've been the only blood flowing through her . - It 's a faith thing . - But why is faith good ?
zone2	n't like the way this thing 's going . I do n't know what this documentary 's supposed to be , but I do n't like where you 're going . You start disputing my God , and you got a problem . I do n't know what you ... I 'm outta here . You do what you wan na do , but I 'm outta here . - I 'm just asking questions . - Okay , no problem . When I 've seen what I 've seen , I know there 's a God . You ca n't change my mind . Nobody can change my mind . I walked for 30 years as a Satanist priest . From the time I grew up , I was in Satanism . For the last six years , that I was into Satanism , I was a Satanist priest , okay ? - Real Satanism ? - Yes , real Satanism . Being addicted to drugs , and running prostitutes and the women and everything that goes with that . I walked around with rolls of money in my
zone2	saved . When the guy said , " Yeah , I used to do drugs . I used to have women , " and I 'm thinking , - " And your problem was ? " - Right . Let me ask you this question : What if we 're right and you 're wrong ? We gon na make it and you ai n't . If you 're being good just to save your ass just because , " Ooh , they might be right and I just want to double down here and make sure that when I get up to the pearly gates , that St . Peter does n't say to me , ' Sorry , asshole , you had the wrong religion . Enjoy Hell , buh-bye . " ' That 's not a good reason , and you know that . Come on , believe in Jesus . What do you have to lose ? It 's like the lotto . You ca n't get saved if you do n't play . Yeah , you could be right . I do n't think it
zone2	be right , because my big thing is I do n't know . That 's what I preach . I preach the gospel of I do n't know ! I mean that 's what I 'm here promoting ... doubt . - That 's my product . - Right . The other guys are selling certainty , not me . I 'm on the corner with doubt . So , Dr . Collins , you are a brilliant brilliant scientist , the head of the Human Genome Project . Now here 's what 's so puzzling is that you are the one scientist ... the one famous scientist anyway ... who 's also religious . Explain that to me . I would argue that if you look at the evidence , the historical evidence of Christ 's existence is overwhelming . What evidence ? I mean , I 've never even heard anyone propose that there 's evidence . There 's been proof that there 's a Jesus . - That 's been proven . - That has n't been proven . How you figure that one ? When I
zone2	the record of eyewitnesses who put down what they saw . You know they were n't eyewitnesses . - They were close to that . - No . Within a couple of decades of eyewitnesses . - Okay . - Would that stand up in a laboratory as absolute foolproof evidence that something happened ? You are setting up a standard for proof that I think would really be an almost impossible standard to meet . No gospel tells us what he was doing when he was a young man . You know , we see Jesus as an infant and then we kind of pick up the story when he 's 30 . I think Jesus was probably an awkward teenager ... big Jewfro , bad at sports . Here I am ! The records we have are all gospels . Gospels are not history . Gospel writers never met Jesus , neither did St . Paul . No one who wrote about Jesus ever met him . How can you go back into the prophets and the prophets specifically specifies that certain things ... Well , first of
zone2	. We agree to that ? I agree to that , but that does n't mean anything . All it means is the people that wrote the New Testament read the Old Testament and then made the prophesies fit . They ca n't make it fit if something did n't happen . Of course they can . Then you 're saying the Bible is fictitious ? - I am . - Ca n't be . I am . We do all know that those texts do n't match . Yeah , sure . Would you expect them to ? I 'm surprised that things that are very important to the story like the virgin birth is n't in all four of them . Would n't you really expect that kind of discordance when you 're thinking about the way in which these documents came into being ? But you 'd think if you were one of Christ 's biographers , that would be sort of an important thing not to leave out . Oh , God , he was also born of a virgin . They do n't notice the
zone2	something if you were any sort of reporter you 'd put into the story . What editor looks at the facts and goes , " Yeah , but take out the thing about the virgin birth . That 's not interesting . " I think being without faith is something that 's a luxury for people who were fortunate enough to have a fortunate life . You know , you go to prison and you hear a guy say , " You know what , buddy ? I got nothing but Jesus in here . " I completely understand that . I think not having faith is a luxury sometimes . If you 're in a foxhole , you probably have a lot of faith , right ? - Mm-hmm . - So I get that . But you guys are n't dumb . You 're smart people . How can smart people ... how can they believe in the talking snake , people living to 900 years old and the virgin birth ? And you know , that 's my question . You guys have your own questions .
zone2	Jesus and by the power of the Holy Spirit , we ask right now , Lord , as we lift up Bill to You , Father , that You can answer his questions that we ca n't answer . Father , we thank You right now for the opportunity that has come today , that we may voice our opinions and hear others . So we ask You , Lord , to touch and feel wisdom right now in the name of Jesus . And we thank You for it in Jesus 's name , amen . Thank you for being Christlike , and not just Christian . Okay . Hey , my wallet ! No , I 'm kidding . You see so many nice people trying to make it about something good and yet it turns into not just corrupt , but , like , fucking-little-kids corrupt and burning-people-alive cor ... I mean , really evil shit . I 'd like to see 10,000 people give $10,000 . Write your biggest check and send it in . We got people on welfare that 's got enough faith to
zone2	I want to be in the green , Lord ! What I 'm about to say is revelation . I got it on DVD . And I have it on DVD . And you need to get this . Hallelujah ! Hallelujah ! Reverend . Is that what I call you ? No , just call me ... doctor . - Doctor ? - Yeah . All right , Doc . First of all , I have to tell you , when I heard that you were in Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes , I was like , " That 's my man . " And it 's funny , because that lyric can be interpreted religiously . " If you do n't know me by now . " Right ? I mean , you must 've thought of that . The song did go platinum . Teddy Pendergrass , who led the song , he was ordained a minister when he was 10 years old . What do you think it says about religion and how serious it is if you can be a minister when you 're
zone2	between musical stars , rock stars and religious figures . They very often both dress - in elaborate costumes ... - Mm-hmm . ... that get people 's attention . People in a congregation must know that the outfit was financed by their donations , and it does n't seem to bother them . I always dress well . I see ! Are those gators ? Those are lizards . - Lizards ? - Yes . - What do they run ? - They do n't run . They crawl . And I see you got a lot of bling . I like gold . The people want you to look well . That 's what pimps say about their women . I was told by one of the greatest pimps that ever lived ... his name is called God ... that if you know what you got , then you ai n't got much . Jesus dressed very well . Oh , come on . - Where is the Biblical evidence ? - Wait a minute . When he was born , they brought him gold . They brought
zone2	image of Jesus as a man who championed the poor and walked around in simple garb , that 's wrong ? It was linen . It was fine linen . - Really ? - Yeah . But Jesus constantly preaches against rich people . The Bible does not speak against being rich . - Jesus does . Very plainly . - No no . Jesus was very very against the rich . He never preached against being poor . Blessed are the poor in spirit , for ... No , he preached against being rich . No no no , he said that it 's better for a rich man ... than a rich man to enter ... It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom . Okay , but now things like houses and cars and clothes and money , they come as a result of my seeking God first . I do n't remember that in the New Testament specifically . But it 's there . I remember it . The houses ,
zone2	Yeah , money comes , money happens , you know . Well , money happens for you because they 're giving it up to you . You 're not giving it up to them . Let me set the record straight . I do not receive a salary from the church . I do not take a salary from the church . - You take it right out of the pot . - No no no . It 's such a powerful position . I mean , you hold people 's greatest hopes and dreams in the palm of your hand , really . Certainly , some of the young women must get a crush on you . Probably . I would too if I was out there . If I was a woman , I 'd probably have a crush on me , too . That 's keepin ' it real . Now I can advise other young men about women , because I 've been there . I had a young man who was about to go crazy over a woman . He was about to kill himself
zone2	of passion , you should have for God . " I said , " Turn that to God and see what happens . " St . Paul , for example , whom I know you compare yourself to . People do . But he famously only wore on his back the clothes that he owned . - Should I assume that this is ... - He was always on the run . This is your only $2,000 suit ? The gentleman who made this suit for me owns a clothing store . Mr . Kane , you in the house ? The prices that I get my clothes for ... - you know , I 'm blessed in that area . - Yes , you are . I 'm more blessed than I 've ever been all the days of my life . And the owner is a Muslim , which ... I came out of Islam . I know , I think it 's very interesting that you 're a Christian now , you were a Muslim and when you get your clothes , you buy them like a
zone2	me and above me is the original Twin Cities , Sodom and Gomorrah . Apparently , it was a pretty wicked place . How wicked ? Well let 's just say that what happened in Gomorrah , stayed in Gomorrah . That is until God got wind of it , so he sent two angels to investigate . Now the angels went to the house of the one godly man in town ... Lot . And the townspeople tried to rape them . Now Lot , not wanting his town to get the reputation as the kind of place that would rape angels , offered up to the mob his own daughters to rape . And he was the good guy in town . Which brings me to this question : If I ever had to swear an oath , why would I want to put my hand on the King James Bible ? I think I could find more morality in the Rick James Bible . God hates fags . The Constitution does not grant to homosexuals the right to perform sodomy . - I 'm a monk .
zone2	of homosexuality ? Do you think that 's ... the Bible is against it . No , the Bible is not against it . The Bible 's not against homosexuality ? If you are born homosexual , you are to stay there . - You have to be happy . - But that 's what the Bible says ? What the Bible means to say , yeah . Oh , what the Bible means to say ! Now that 's a good book . It preaches the rock-solid truth . You are faggots ! I do n't hate them . God hates them . - Hey , Bill . - How are you ? Nice to meet you . Okay . Okay . So of course , the reason why we 're here is because you 're ... I guess we would say , ex-gay . You used to be gay and then you married someone who used to be a lesbian . And you have three children , and I guess the jury 's out on them . Okay , and would you say it 's just like any
zone2	? Oh , funny . Ha ha . Got that . I do n't classify myself as ex-gay , you know ? I 'm a heterosexual guy who dealt with some homosexuality . Okay , so the people who come here are people who are wanting to do what you did . They want to reform their life and lead a heterosexual life . But I will be honest with you . The reality 's a lot of people come here and go right back into whatever they came from . - Because they 're gay ! - I believe that it 's sin . Excuse me , but do n't you have it , no pun intended , ass-backwards ? Meaning ? Meaning homosexuality is something that occurs in nature . I was out bird watching , but I 'd rather watch you . Why do n't you come over and get some ? Man is who wrote the Bible . Nature made gay people . Nobody 's born gay . There 's no scientific or ... Really ? Have you ever met Little Richard ? We can look
zone2	order ? " A man has a penis . A woman has a vagina . Let 's just be blunt . There 's no scientific data that proves that anyone is ... there 's no gay gene . And you also discovered the gay gene ? Yes . This is all coming from the Bible which you believe ... - Right . ... to be the word of God . - I do . - All of the proscriptions against homosexuality come from the Old Testament . Jesus never said a word about homosexuality . And if it 's so important , why did n't he ever bring it up ? We could pick lots of little things that he did n't specifically talk about . - But this is a big thing . - Let me stop this whole thing . You know , I 'm not sure what your documentary is about , but if it 's to basically refute the word of God , then I 'm not interested in doing your interview , okay ? - Well , I ... - I think that obviously you
zone2	I do . But what is your explanation for the millions and millions of people around the world who are - leading homosexual lives ... - Well , it 's not millions . ... have no interest in anyone of the opposite sex ? Are they all faking just to piss off Jesus ? They did n't choose this . They did n't desire it . Right , they were born gay . No , they were n't born that way . It 's because of the insecurity within theirselves . It takes a lot of security to walk out of the house with assless chaps . - They 're not happy , most of them . - They 're called gay . They took the word . Some of them look positively thrilled . No , they are people who are really not complete in who they are as men or women . That 's a pretty big judgment for a Christian . - It 's not a judgment . - That 's not a judgment ? That you are sitting here telling these people who you do n't
zone2	like you ? I mean , it 's not the people you suspect that are gay , that are gay . People like the Reverend Ted Haggard ... Moral purity is better than immorality . ... who kept meeting homosexual prostitutes in a hotel room and having gay sex with speed . Evangelicals have the best sex life of any other group . - Good Morning , Duane ! - But he was n't gay ? I already answered that . I do n't believe that anybody is gay . I do n't know , but honestly , if I just saw you in a bar or something , I would say ... and do n't take this the wrong way ... I would say , " Yeah , I think that guy is gay . " You 're good looking . You 're neat , you know . - You do n't look like me . - Meaning ? Meaning ... - All right , thank you . - Can I give you a hug ? - Yes ! - I hug everybody , so can I give you
zone2	much . Hey , you did n't have a hard-on there , did you ? Nope , sorry . Ca n't do that . That was good , though . When I was 17 , my first girlfriend dumped me , and I was sad in a way I 'd never been sad . You know , your first dumping is the worst . And at that point , you 're very vulnerable to any sort of connection with , you know ... I did n't get like Jesus-religious , but I did think a force out there was communicating to me through song lyrics or ... numerology I was very interested in for a while . You said you were groping for something at that time . You know , you make up an imaginary friend who loves you , is sympathetic to you and has a plan for you . It 's much more important . He did n't have to love me , God , He just had to be working for me . You know , He 's like an agent . So you are an
zone2	made you to decide to be a follower of Christ ? What brought Christ into your life ? Back in ' 75 , I went to Michigan State University . - $2,700 ? - Yeah , it 's pricey . Boy , I wonder what Madonna without the child runs you . So getting back to my story , I could ask God to do things in the name of Jesus and they would happen . So I ca n't even recall all the little miracles He did , but He proved to me that He was real and He was there . They were so miraculous and you ca n't remember what they were ? There were so many of them and they were little things . - Give me an example . - One example I can remember was I was at a party . There was a guy who was working with Jews for Jesus , and I asked him , " Can I get a drink of water ? " And he says , " You know what ? Here 's a glass , stick your
zone2	I did n't like the attitude . I said okay , and I stuck my hand out the window and it started pouring rain . Pouring so bad that people could n't leave the party . To me , that 's a miracle . You do n't have to believe it , - but I know between me and God ... - It is pretty lame . - But you asked . - I asked , but I 'm just saying - that 's my reaction to your answer . - But that 's just one of many things . I live a life of miracles . No , you live your life with the same sort of mundane coincidences that happen to everybody in the world . It 's not like , you know , if it rained frogs , I would say you had a point . But it rains , and it stops raining . Well , when was the last time you asked for rain and it starting raining within 10 seconds ? I do n't know . I do n't ever ask for rain .
zone2	started to rain , I would n't think it was because I asked for it . I would think because it sometimes rains . God is not that busy where He ca n't spend time listening to you when you really want to talk to Him , anytime . If Santa Claus can hit every house in the world - in one night ... - I do n't believe in Santa Claus . Of course not , that 's ridiculous . That 's one man flying all around the world and dropping presents down a chimney . That 's ridiculous . One man hearing everybody murmur to him at the same time , that I get . And you know what else was very confusing to me ? I remember vividly was Santa Claus - and Jesus . - You were so mad at us . - Oh , yes . - So mad at you , why ? Oh , when ... When you realized there was no Santa Claus . And then when I found out there was no Jesus , boy , was I pissed . You
zone2	after you die , you 'll go to a better place . I know I 'll be with God . I 'll be with Jesus . And that 's a better place . Even if it was in a garbage can , which I know it wo n't be , but even if it was , just the fact that I 'm with Jesus , to me , is good . - It 's a better place . - It 's a better place . Then why do n't you kill yourself ? Because God still has a mission for me here . Oh , I see . I 'm thinking of Jonah . God sent Jonah on a mission . When did the part of the story come when Jonah lived in the whale ? It was a great fish . It 's one of my favorite nonsense stories , Jonah living inside of the whale . And their answer unfailingly is " The Bible does n't say whale . It says big fish . " Oh , yeah , big fish , that makes ... I 'm sorry
zone2	It 's a big fish . Of course you could live for three days in a big fish . A tuna . They do it all the time in Japan . They have tuna spas . You go for three days . They pamper you , oils . You come out of that tuna feeling fantastic . You smell like pussy , but you feel fantastic . This man lived inside of a fish for three days ? Miraculously , yes . Steve , Steve , Steve . You do n't believe in miracles . - That does n't mean they do n't exist . - Of course not ! I 'm not 10 ! He lived in a fish . Come on . Your bar on miracles is pretty low , I got ta tell you , bro . Well , whatever . Two things that are completely incompatible are Christianity as Jesus taught it - and nationalism ... - Right . Exactly . ... and yet people always say God and country . Jesus would never ... you know , people who are such good Christians ... in
zone2	" Well , you got ta take care of your own first . I know people overseas have trouble , but you got ta take " ... that is not a message I can ever see the Jesus in the Bible , even when he was in a bad mood , would say . I 'm gon na vote Bible . It 's time for God 's people to come out of the closets , out of the churches and change America ! Unless you and I do what God wants us to do , he 'll go to some other country . God , forgive America ! I would probably have to say yes , that the Constitution established the United States of America as a Christian nation . We have , of course , " In God We Trust " on our money . The Senate will come to order . The chaplain will lead the Senate in prayer . How did this country get to be a Christian nation ? I 've read a lot of quotes from all the Founding Fathers . There are a lot
zone2	nation . And Jefferson 's a particularly interesting case . Did n't he write his own Bible which divorced the New Testament from what he considered the unnecessary magic , bells and whistles ? He took the Gospels , took out all of Jesus 's miracles and took out all of Jesus 's statements that claimed divinity , and put out a new book called " The Faith and Moral Teachings of Jesus of Nazareth . " We tend to lionize these guys and think of them all as the 12 Apostles plus the Founding Fathers , like they 're in the same club or something . When in fact , these men understood very well that there was a difference between being Christian and being American . - Right . - In Jefferson 's age , fewer people went to church less often . Do you think that there are a lot of people who feel the way you do , but are afraid to speak out ? Absolutely . Are you kidding ? Yes , I think it is the great untapped minority in this country . In
zone2	Americans who now say they are absolutely unaffiliated with any religion , do n't want to be in a religion , just do n't go near me with religion . 16% of the population is a huge minority . It 's bigger than Jews , blacks , homosexuals , NRA members , lots of people you could name who have lobbies that get everything they want or are at least are in the debate . You want me to kinda angle like this or straight ahead ? Just as natural as possible to Bill . So you 've described yourself as an Evangelical Christian . You did a campaign ad where you said the most important lessons in life are in this book right here , meaning the Bible . Everyone in politics likes to brag that they 're a person of faith . Why is faith good ? Faith has a way of softening people . For example , if you look at the teachings of Jesus , he 's very forgiving . He also said , " If a man does n't abide in me , he is
zone2	branches are gathered , thrown into the fire and burned . " Right . So ? I do think , ' cause I 'm a Christian , that Jesus is the way to be reconciled . And I do believe the actual literacy of that story . We 'll let God sort out all the details of that on Judgment Day . What about the 10 Commandments ? So many politicians talk about the 10 Commandments . Are they really the 10 most - important moral ... - Are these the 10 suggestions ? The 10 recommendations ? But it 's not really a wide list of 10 . The first four are all about just worshipping God and basically that he 's a jealous God , and he does n't want you to have any other gods . The only two that are really laws are do n't steal and do n't kill . Why is this the wisest group of 10 ? It does n't include child abuse . It does n't include do n't torture . It does n't include a lot of things ... rape ...
zone2	, we would probably include . Society is so different today and our culture is so radically different today . That 's what I 'm asking . We 're in a different culture . Can you think of anything else that we still cleave to from the Bronze Age ? Well ... Basically , murder is against the law in every country in the world . But would n't we have come to that even without religion ? Do n't you think people would have gotten together and said , " You know what ? Let 's not slaughter each other - and not take each other 's stuff . " - I do n't know . There 's been more killing in the name of " My God . " You think maybe sort of indigously or just by our DNA , we somehow know that killing another person is wrong ? I 'm not sure that that 's the case . Really , you need God to decide not to kill each other ? Well , you can look back at more primitive cultures , and they were
zone2	, modern nations , the most religious nation . A recent study found that among 32 countries , more people in this country doubted evolution than any other country on that list , except , I think , it was Turkey . In the US , we have freedom of religion . I think most of the countries on that list do have freedom of religion . Well , that 's interesting . Do you believe in evolution ? You know my ... I do n't know . Clearly the scientific community 's a little divided on some of the specifics of that and I understand that . - I do n't think they are . - No no ... well ... I think they pretty much agree . I do n't know how it all happened . I 'm certainly willing to accept the scientific premise . It could n't possibly have been Adam and Eve 5,000 years ago with a talking snake and a garden , could it ? Well , it could 've possibly been that . Come on . See , this is my problem .
zone2	one of the very few people who are really running this country . It worries me that people are running my country who think ... who believe in a talking snake . You do n't have to pass an IQ test to be in the Senate , though . As you first come into the Creation Museum , there 's going to be a sense of " This is something really big . " This is something awe-inspiring , something great here . We can answer the questions of the skeptics that attack the Bible 's history . We admit that we start from the Bible here to teach them how to think . Really , in a nutshell , we 're saying , the Bible 's true from Genesis to Revelation . We 're building the whole place for about $27 million . I have many people say to me , " As a Christian , ca n't you believe in evolution ? " I say , " Well , you got a problem . God made a man and a woman . " If you believe in evolution
zone2	. All right , but you 're so damned ugly . This is what we call the main hall here . Immediately , people see dinosaurs and people together , which is very different to the idea of the evolutionists who say dinosaurs died out 70 million ago or so , and so they did n't live with humans . They see an animatronic dinosaur over here . Two animatronic baby T-Rexes and two animatronic children . It 's basically just to give people a wow factor as they come in here . How to share your faith effectively and Biblically , to be able to reason with people , learn to circumnavigate or go around the person 's intellect . There 's plenty of people who would say , " Well , it 's just my faith . " But that 's not good enough for you . You say , " No . We can basically reconcile the science with what 's in Genesis . " We 're an organization that ... to put it in a nutshell ... is telling people that the Bible 's history is
zone2	up overwhelmingly on one side of this issue . It would have to be an enormous conspiracy going on between scientists of all different disciplines in all different countries to have such a consensus . That does n't move you ? No , not at all , because from a Biblical perspective , I understand why the majority would not agree with the truth . Man is a sinner . Man is rebelling against his creator . All these scientists are sinners ? Well ... We have been talking to so many religious people and many of them believe the earth is 5,000 years old . If you 're a scientist , you ca n't accept that . Now you recently were the director of the Vatican Observatory . A Vatican astronomer . It 's one of those terms like " gay Republican " ... you know , you just do n't expect it . - I 'm not getting into that . - No no no , I 'm not asking you to . It 's not that the church has the idea , you know , they 're
zone2	first one's out there to baptize those extraterrestrials before the Mormons get at ' em . The reason is simply historical facts . John Paul II , for instance , said evolution in the neo-Darwinian sense is no longer a mere hypothesis . I mean , he said that . It 's in writing . I still do n't understand why it 's important for there to have to have been a situation on earth where a man co-existed with dinosaurs . Only really in " The Flintstones " ... Is someone talking about me ? ... and that Raquel Welch movie does man ever co-exist with dinosaurs . Why is that important for your salvation or your morality ? If you 're saying this part over here , it says God made land animals and man on the same day is not true , then ultimately , why should I believe this bit over here ? The Christian Scriptures were written between about 2,000 years before Christ to about 200 years after Christ . That 's it . Modern science came to be with Galileo up through Newton ,
zone2	, okay , is in that period . How in the world could there be any science in scripture ? There can not be . Just the two historical periods are separated by so much . The Scriptures are not teaching science . It 's very hard for me to accept , not just a literal interpretation of scripture , but a fundamentalist approach to religious belief . It 's kind of a plague . It presents itself as science and it 's not . God is an infinite God who is working in ways - we do n't always understand . - You do n't think that 's a cop-out ? He is God . Are you God ? No . We went to church every Sunday . My sister and I went to Catechism , which is Catholic , you know , like Hebrew school for papists . It was like war . It was vast stretches of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror . I 'm in the Vatican . Buongiorno ! I know what you 're thinking . I 'm standing in front of a
zone2	and they digitalized the Vatican in behind me . No no , that 's really the Vatican . I ought to know . I just got thrown out of it . See , I wanted to interview the Pope , but I was willing to settle for a cardinal or a monsignor or the Flying Nun ... really anybody ... but apparently I 've been on the Catholic shit list for quite a while . But that 's their loss , ' cause now I 'm gon na say what I really think , which is mainly : Does that look anything like anything Jesus Christ had in mind ? When you look at a building like that , a giant palace , does it seem at odds with the message of the founder ? Well , certainly . - Well , thank you . - I mean , that 's obvious . It really is obvious , is n't it ? But does it bother you ? Well , I mean ... well , yes it does . I would n't ... if I were the boss , I
zone2	be probably out in some barracks here in a suburb of Rome , got it ? Do you ever get so fed up you want to take the collar and go ... - Well , I do n't wear a collar anyway . ... " That 's it , Captain . Take my badge and my collar . " I read about 10 books recently ... the rationality of religion , and everyone 's saying it 's stupid . You know what 's gon na happen to them . - No , what 's gon na happen ? - They 're gon na be roasting in hell . Come on , roasting . That 's the old Catholic thing . That 's what they taught me . Yeah , I know , that hell business . Well , come on , the standard doctrine that I was taught as a kid ... Yeah , that 's all gone . That 's all finished . But that 's not fair . - Yeah , pfft ! - The date of Jesus 's birth really was n't established until 349 A.D .
zone2	on July 3rd . These are all nice stories , you know . - And that does n't bother you , either ? - That bothers me too . I mean , when everybody 's , " Ooh , we have to have midnight mass because Jesus was born on midnight on 25th of " ... this is all nonsense . - You 're a maverick , are n't you ? - I 'm not a maverick . You 're Father Maverick . You do things your own way . When you add up all the saints and all the angels and archangels and super-duper angels ... there 's God , the Father , God the Son , the Holy Ghost , Mother Mary ... it does start to look like it 's not quite the monotheistic religion that it 's ... Oh , I understand . Like we have mini-gods . Yeah , well , it does seem like that , if people pray to a ... Well , yeah , but some people just do n't understand this . You probably are ... you do n't follow things
zone2	you know , and they said , " In a crisis , what kind of saints do you pray to ? " Got it ? You know who 's the sixth on the list ? Jesus Christ . The sixth ? He 's the sixth man that the Italians call upon when they have problems . Is n't that neat ? - That 's very interesting . - Talk about Cafeteria Catholics . Pfft ! So how do you convince people of what 's the true faith ? You do n't , forget it . You just have to live and die with their stupid ideas . I 'm sorry . What are you gon na do ? You can go to a pitch meeting at a movie studio and go , " Okay , there 's a spaceman who zaps a virgin and he gives birth to a son who 's also him , who then goes on a suicide mission . " I wonder what people would say about that . Yeah , that is actually a great pitch . It has so many elements that they like
zone2	, and Hollywood loves something it 's never seen before ... a virgin . Hey , Shalom . We 're so glad to have you here . Just come and get blessed . These are here to teach God 's word . We 're in a spiritual warfare . We do n't push our beliefs on people , but we do make them available . - Have you ever had a Muslim person ? - Yes , definitely . People from Gaza Strip come . We get many people who come here say , " We 've come every year to Florida and we 've done the tourist things and all and we enjoy those . We wish we had seen this first , " because their experience here was so meaningful . Do you think if ... when you were a kid ... they transposed the Bible stories with the fairy tales , you 'd know the difference as an adult ? - My name is Eve . - I 'm Adam . This place is amazing . If they told you Jack and the Beanstalk was religion and
zone2	a fairy-tale book ... you think when you got to be an adult , you 'd be defending the one instead of the other ? So you 're saying that the Bible 's a fairy tale ? God took my rib like this and began to whittle it like this and blow on it ... and then ... Saved means believing in Jesus Christ - as the only begotten Son of God . - Not for me , it do n't . What about the Muslims ? Many Muslims are saved right now . I do n't get it . I pray in your lifetime you do . Jesus came through a Jew . He was not the seed of man . He came through a Jewish woman , but no man had ever touched her . No flesh had ever touched her . He was the seed of God . You want me to lean up against the tomb or something or you want casual or ... okay . Did I give you my cell phone ? Oh , I left my cell phone , right ? Just want
zone2	testing . How you doing , Bill ? God bless you . - Hi . - Seen you around . - Welcome to our world . - I 've seen you around . Now is this your tomb ? Is this a real rock ? No , it 's just cement . They just kind of cemented it in there . So when you go out to dinner , people recognize you ? All the time , yeah . I think you get a little bit of that , too . But they do n't think I 'm the Lord . You must really be ... Why do you think people come here ? ' Cause Disneyland 's too smutty ? I personally have n't been to the Holy Land , so this was an awesome experience for me when I walked on the property . - I was like , " Wow , this is cool . " - Let me ask you questions - about your business ... - Yes . ... or really the Jesus business . God is super powerful . - He can do anything
zone2	the devil and therefore get rid of evil in the world ? - He will . - He will ? What 's he waiting for ? - End times . - But why play it out like that ? - Why make it a game ? - Well , it 's not necessarily a game . A day is like a thousand years in God 's eyes , it says in the Bible . If you wan na look at it ... just like two days ago , Christ died . But I know that he is so far beyond any of our ways , that he can work the worst situation for his good . What was the Holocaust ? Why was that good ? You know , God had a plan for that . Maybe it 's to cause ... I wonder if you would have thought that if you were one of the people - being pushed into an oven . - Well , you know what ? It 's like trying to explain to an ant how a TV works . That 's ... God 's
zone2	no way you can understand that . We need to stop the interview for just a moment , please . - Nice to see you . - Senior manager of public relations . - Hi , Les , I 'll be right with you . - Hi . Sure . I 'm not afraid of the piranha women . When he came , he said , " I come not to abolish the law , but to fulfill it . " You boil all those Levitical laws down to two things : No other God is before me , Bill , and love the Lord with all your heart . But , Jesus , having no other gods before you , that 's not moral . There 's nothing moral about that . It 's just something a jealous god would do . It does say that our God is a jealous god . But your God is jealous ? That seems so unGodlike that God would have such a petty human emotion . I know people who have gotten over jealousy , - let alone God . - There
zone2	just God and he 's also a merciful God . No , he spends the first five books of the Bible wiping out people . That 's what he chose to do . His ways are higher than ours , Bill . - Maybe our thinking should be higher . - That 's a good point . God has got this God-sized hole in your life . You can fit that with any position ... drugs , sex , whatever you want ... it is not gon na fill it . - Can I try ? - You can try all you want . You 're gon na end up hurting yourself , damaging yourself and burning yourself up . I thought Christ was about not judging people . - That 's true . - Is n't that a judgment there ? You do n't know me and you 're telling me I need to fill a hole in my heart - with drugs and sex . - No , I 'm not talking about you . I 'm saying anyone in general . See , if I was God
zone2	with . Have you ever had a little voice in the back of your mind say something ? - We 've all had that . - That 's called the Holy Spirit . - That 's not God . That 's you . - That 's called the Holy Spirit . - Feel this wind right now ? - Yeah . Okay , where is it ? You do n't know , right ? - Yeah , it 's called wind . - Okay , that 's like the Holy Spirit . It 's a monotheistic religion , but there 's three of them . Just like water can be ice , steam and water . I see . It 's different forms , different shapes for the different purposes . The analogy that Jesus at the amusement park said yesterday was brilliant , about the Trinity is like water . It can be steam . It can be ice . It can be liquid . Wow , that is ... boy , that stopped me in my tracks for a second , you know ? That 's just a
zone2	minutes , it 's still complete bullshit . There this space God and he 's himself and he sent himself on a suicide mission . He 's a God , but he has a kid . He 's a single parent . It 's just silly , but when you put it in the water analogy , I can see that , you know , those ladies there , when they heard that the first time , they were like , done . Sold . Oh , you had me at ice cube . Moving on . Does it ever bother you that the story of a man who was born of a virgin was resurrected ? Your bio was something that was going around the Mediterranean for at least 1,000 years . We 've got Krishna who was in India 1,000 years before Christ . Krishna was a carpenter , born of a virgin , baptized in a river . Are you saying that was written in history ? That was written down in history , is that what you 're saying ? Absolutely , there 's the Persian
zone2	25th , performed miracles , resurrected on the third day , known as the Lamb , the Way , the Truth , the Light , the Savior , Messiah . Stop ! Blasphemer ! All I know is that I do n't go by that hearsay . I go by the word of God . I know that 's why I believe . - Well , I believe it because it 's truth . - Believe it , yes . But there 's a difference between truth and what you believe . In the Bible it tells us that all things are possible with God , okay ? Study the religions of the Mediterranean region for a thousand years before . Many of the gods were born on December 25th . - No , it 's not . - It 's not a new one . It 's funny you should bring that up because of course in " Star Wars : Episode I ... The Phantom Menace , " Anakin is born to a virgin . People see that and say , " Wait a second . Where have
zone2	. - But the Jesus story was n't original . - How so ? Let me ask you a question . Let 's say , if you take the side - that this is all made up ... - I do . ... what if you 're wrong ? What if you 're wrong ? # Down the Via Dolorosa # # In Jerusalem that day # # The soldiers tried # # To clear the narrow street # # But the crowd pressed in to see # # The man condemned to die # # On Calvary # # Down the Via Dolorosa # # Called the Way of Suffering # # Like a lamb came the Messiah # # Christ the King # # And he chose to walk that road # # Out of his love # # For you # # And me . # Was Jesus a sinner ? One master . One word . I am your master . Who do we put away in the asylums ? Xenu brought us here 75 million years ago , stacked us around volcanoes and blew them
zone2	universe . You have to rid yourself of the implants from the extraterrestrial dictators ! - Get an E-Meter . Yes , get an E-Meter ! - An E-meter ? Audit yourself . How do you people expect to get to the next level ? I 'm not making the rules . Aw ... You know , Scientologists ... And right , you 're like , " Oh , yeah , that 's some crazy shit . Okay . Jesus with the virgin birth and the dove and the snake who talked in the garden , that 's cool . But the Scientologists , they 're the crazy one's . " That 's not true . That ... that ... I do n't have any idea of what you 're talking about . But it has something to do with making sure that we 're born with a defect , so that the souls of ours are infected with aliens ... Thank you . ... because the cure ? Scientology . They 're all crazy . Yes , the religions do get even crazier . They have to to keep
zone2	've done the virgin birth , you know , where do you go ? We 're not getting the top ? - We got the top . - Oh , okay . That 's the Mormon Temple behind me . To be a Mormon is to believe some really crazy stuff , crazy even by the standards of the big religions . When you 're the new kid on the block ... Thank you . That was helpful . You 're the new kid on the block and all the good crazy has already been picked over , so you kind of have to up the ante . Oh . God damn it . Not while I 'm in the middle of it . Well , we do have it . Boy , a lot of people came - out of the woodwork . - Yeah . So did you guys get anybody from the church to talk to ? Well , if you count getting thrown off the property - " talked to . " - That 's probably better . We 'd like you to " Meet the
zone2	up the Doctrine of Covenants , you read the autobiography of Joseph Smith . He quotes Jesus Christ as telling him that every other creed on earth is , quote , " an abomination . " An abomination . I mean , that 's not a very ecumenical statement . You 're talking about things that , I think , at some level you sense just do not make sense . I 'm glad you said that because I read some of the tenets of Mormonism , like " God lives on a planet near the star of Kalob . " - Kolob . - Kolob . God the Father who 's a physical man with a body of flesh and bone is probably about 6 ' tall , lives on a place called Kolob , had sexual relations with Mary ... remember he 's a man . " Jesus Christ was conceived by God the father having actual sex with Mary . " Mary said , " If this is what God wants , I 'll be glad to do His will . " " Dark skin is a
zone2	, a dark-skinned person can become light-skinned . " According to the Book of Mormon , after his resurrection , Jesus came to the Americas to preach to the Indians . " That American Indians are actually a lost tribe of Israel . " They 're lost Jews . And also the idea that Christianity is American , I think , is an amazing entitlement to a people who are always trying to meld God and country . The Garden of Eden was in Missouri according to Mormonism . The new Jerusalem will be there . Branson , I 'm hoping . I 've also heard that the Mormon Church baptizes dead people . You can be baptized for about 50 people , 100 people that 've died . And so you just get dunked about 50 to 100 times . That 's baptism for the dead . Caffeine is evil . That magic underwear can protect you . And that you need a secret password to get into heaven . Everyone must stand at the final judgment before Joseph Smith , Jesus and Elohim . This is n't an
zone2	so few people do what you have done and leave the church ? The moment you acknowledge to yourself that Joseph Smith did not tell the truth about his experiences and his achievements , you just committed social suicide . - Family and friends ... - Family and friends . ... will ... you 're off the deep end . Dr . Andrew Newberg , nice to meet you . I 've finally met someone who 's studied ... neurotheology . This is getting very close to something I always say , which is that religion is a neurological disorder . What does the brain look like when it 's hopped up on God ? We see a lot of different colors , which help us to ... tell us what the activity is in the brain and what we have found is that there are some very specific changes when people are actually meditating or praying or even speaking in tongues , which was our last study . In the name of Jesus , you 've been made whole by the power of God . - Speaking in tongues
zone2	're just babbling , though , right ? They 're not really speaking in a language they do n't know . It 's not an actual language , but what 's ... Just bullshit , Doc , come on . Is n't that something ? I love you . So you would agree that even if a billion people believe something , it can still be ridiculous ? - Absolutely . - But the Jews , I mean , they 're ... excuse me , Jewish friends ... but they 're as cuckoo as anybody , especially the really Orthodox one's . You are one of the few Jewish people in the world who does not believe in the state of Israel . You do not think the state - of Israel should exist . - Correct . - Okay . - God gave us the land of Israel . On Mount Sinai where we made this bond with God , He said , " I 'm giving you the land , but I 'm stipulating ... very clearly stipulating ... you must be on a certain level of holiness
zone2	sent out of the land . So basically you 're saying that the Jewish people have not been holy enough to deserve the land of Israel . God understands what is good for us , what is bad for us ... - First of all ... ... what will bring us safety or not . Let me just finish . God told us , though , if you will go against God ... - God manipulates the world ... - Okay , I ... Wait a second . Let me finish this . God said if you 're going to try to make the state , you will be unsuccessful . You are looking through ... you 're trying to look at this world through a keyhole . I 'm looking through the key ... Let me finish . God is compassionate . Everything is directly from God , we believe . - But it seems to me ... - I 'll now explain what you 're asking . The concept of saying that we 've suffered enough anti-Semitism ... Never again . So you do n't say " Never
zone2	. Let us understand that the Jewish people were living in exile for 2,000 years under God 's protection and we were living in Western civilization ... - Germany , Poland . Not anymore ... - Let me finish . We were living amongst all nations throughout the years . ... ' cause they 're all dead . How many people died in the Holocaust ? You 're jumping . Let 's jump to the Holocaust . I thought the issue was Jewish safety . I thought the issue was how many Jews are dying . So let 's talk about Jewish safety . Okay , I 'm sure there was a few ... A couple million Jews died , that 's okay , that 's the wording you use ? You 're the one who went to Iran in December 2006 for the president of that country 's Holocaust " denial " conference . Whoa , do n't just throw words . Why does Ahmadinejad say that he wants Israel - to be wiped from the face of the ... - When did he say that ? - He
zone2	he say ? What was the exact quote ? - He said it should disappear . - What , is he David Copperfield ? - That 's chutzpah . - Never again , Rabbi , never again . Wait . One more second . No , I 'm out . We have Conservatives . We have Reforms . We have the Orthodox . You are an observing Jew . It says it right there in the fourth commandment : Honor the Sabbath day to keep it holy . Friday night to Saturday night , you do n't do anything . Yeah , the rabbis over the centuries have created these prohibitions as a way to try to protect the day of rest . You ca n't use electricity . You ca n't drive . Let 's talk a little about keeping the Sabbath holy . I 've always wondered if it came about because God rested on the Sabbath and that 's why man has to . That 's right , and that was the creation of the seventh day , that there should be rest . There are 39
zone2	the Sabbath . One of them is lighting a fire . Planting . Another one is plowing . Another one is tying a knot , untying a knot . One is building , and one is destroying so as to build . So much more kosher is to develop these gadgets - that figure out a way around it . - That 's right . It does seem that you are , to a degree , trying to outsmart God . If the lawmaker never makes a mistake , and still there 's a loophole there , why is that loophole there ? To be used in a situation of need . But how did this get updated for a 4,000-year-old rule ? It seems there 's an awful lot that has to do with electricity . Rabbi Halperin 's work here is translating it into something more modern . Let 's look at some of the gadgets you have . I 'm particularly interested in the phone . Is there not a cell phone ? It 's not a cell phone . Okay , wow . I have to
zone2	to dial itself all the time . Hello . Hello . When I take the stick - and I put it into the hole ... - Hello . ... I 'm inhibiting that which is inhibiting the number from dialing itself . Let me ask about this . It 's obviously a wheelchair . - May I ? - Sure . Oh , wow . And this is not the new model , I 'm guessing . - This is the experimental prototype . - I see . Schmuck ! - This runs on air pressure , right ? - Correct . Basically , we 've got 150 atmospheres of pressure here . We 've got the turning it on , turning it off here . So air is okay . - Air good . Fire bad . - Fire bad . Fire bad ! We 've taken an old bicycle ... - I forgot what it 's called . - Tire . Okay . Air goes in , air goes out . If I was a person in that wheelchair , I might say to myself , " Why
zone2	who 's taken away my legs to begin with ? " Okay . That would be fascinating . It 's an elevator . Oh , it 's a Shabbatavator . Let me guess , you ca n't push a button ... - Correct . ... on the Sabbath . The issues behind the scenes that people do n't see are the real problems . An even bigger problem might be how do you get someone to put this in their building if they 're not completely nuts ? Well , actually , that really does n't make a difference . Hmm . How we define what is crazy or not crazy about religions is ultimately up to how we define crazy . If you define mental illness as anyone who hears a voice talking to them , then anyone who has heard the voice of God is crazy . She talks about a prophecy that these children needed to die . The dispatcher asked " Why did you do this ? " " I was told to . " " Who told you ? " " God . " There
zone2	in layman 's terms , Jesus was nuts . Moses ... " Stay here , I 'm going up and getting the 10 Commandments right from God . " You know , ' cause one thing I 've also ... We did n't have brain-scan technology back then , so it 's a hard to tell . I know , but if a guy says he went up on a mountain and he talked to God , and He talked to him through a burning bush , that guy 's a cuckoo . All those pastors who refer to me as the anti-Christ , false prophet , it 's because they 're miserable . Anyone who does n't believe in me is miserable . - My mike is on ? - Yes , sir . Okay , who are you Biblically ? I am Jesus Christ man , the second coming of Christ , I am . The Old Testament speaks about me clearly and the New Testament also . - About you personally ? - Yes . Not just because you have ... you share the name Jesus ?
zone2	also share the name Miranda . Maybe you 're Carmen Miranda . Maybe the second coming of her ? You should have fruit on your head , instead of fruit in your head . Okay . Fuck you . How 's that ? Why do you think God chose you ? Jesus of Nazareth had a wife so after they killed him , his seed kept going , maybe through France , Spain , and then from Spain , came to Puerto Rico . The bloodline come from Abraham , Abraham to David , David to Jesus of Nazareth , Jesus of Nazareth , me . Okay , I though a second coming was the reincarnation of the Christ himself , not a descendant of . No , he 's a descendant . Descendant ? Oh ... but you do n't believe in hell ? - No . - Or the Devil ? - No . - Or even sin , right ? No , there 's not a sin any longer . What you teach is that Jesus died for our sins and so there 's not really any
zone2	is like a diet doctor saying , - " Eat anything you want . " - Right . " You do n't lose weight , but it 's easy to stick to . " That 's what I believe , Bill . Oh , I know you do . And I have many people who believe in this . And yet , you have a little ... you have a little twinkle in your eye when say it . No , I believe in that . I believe . How do we know ? Because lots of people would like this job . How do you get this job as the second coming ? It 's not on Craigslist . - Yeah . - I 'm guessing . Maybe it is . See , two angels ... Two guys named Angel , Spanish guys . You know what I 'm talking about , you fucking cockroach ! - No . - Oh , actual angels . - Two angels came to me ... - Okay . ... and they told me " The Lord of Lords and King of Kings
zone2	" What form did the angels come in ? How tall ? Little tall and strong . Whatever they told me , I obey . I do n't wan na mess with them . But I 'm just saying , it seems that if God wanted to communicate something to the world ... He 's all powerful ... He would just talk to the whole world . It always seems He picks out a prophet in private and tells them , " Okay , you 're the prophet . " - I am . - " You go tell the rest of the world . " So we just sort of have to take it on faith . We just sort of have to believe you . Right , yeah , it 's true . Abraham . Noah . Lord , what shall I do ? Moses , climb the mount alone . Once again , the Lord had spoken to Joseph Smith as he had to Adam , Abraham , Moses , Paul and others . I am the first Christian . And the rest are really kind of
zone2	a Jew . That 's it . In fact , they put on the plates ... they say " My boss is a Jewish carpenter . " How ridiculous is that ? A Jewish carpenter ! - Imagine . - Come on , Jews hire carpenters . They do n't ... you know , people say " I found my calling in life . " And it 's a good calling . It 's a nice living . People adore you . Everywhere you go , they treat you like Christ , like you 're the Messiah . You know , if I discovered that I was Satan in person , I would do a good job , too , because I would be faithful to my calling . It 's how you do your work , is n't it ? You know , at the end of the day , whether you 're the Messiah or you 're Satan , it 's loving what you do and giving it 100% . I give 100% . I was n't born skeptical . I was still making deals with " God
zone2	smoking . There was some shitty problem I had in my life , and I made a deal with God , " Okay , if you make this problem go away , I will quit smoking , and I wo n't go back on it ' cause I 'd know I 'd be going back on a deal with God . " And you know , I got ta say , I 'm kind of glad I had " God " in my life . You are the head of the First Universal Church of Cantheism ... - Yes . ... which is really built around - this substance here . - No . No ? Okay , I got that wrong . But it 's built around smoking this . I mean , it has no dogma , right ? You 're not preaching to anybody . You 're not saying - you 'll save their souls , no rituals . - No . How does this differ from just getting wasted ? I mean that in the best possible way , but ... I understand the concept of
zone2	Do you feel that every time you smoke pot ? No . Phew ! I thought it was just me . So why do you think it 's this family of drugs that 's so good for opening our minds as opposed to ludes , PCP , or smashing up your mother 's diet pills and smoking ' em in a pipe ? I do n't know . I do n't know . So I did want to get your thoughts about what 's going on in this city . This is your city . There 's a lot of controversy with ... maybe the Dutch are so tolerant that they 're now tolerating intolerance . There 's a lot of tension with the Muslim community . It 's all religious fundamentalists . They already killed Theo Van Gogh , who was a known television maker . This is the spot where Theo Van Gogh - was assassinated ? - This is exactly the spot . He was a Dutch filmmaker . He made a 10-minute film . It was deeply offensive to Muslims . Oh , Allah , you
zone2	because you have given the one more strength than the other . I feel at least once a week , the strength of my husband 's fist on my face . Lots of people think that free speech goes right up to this point and then when you 're talking about religion , when you 're talking about the Prophet , all bets are off . It goes both ways , freedom of speech . It goes both ways , but the people who actually ... usually do the killing for it wind up on the Muslim side . Do you think that says something about the different cultures ? I do n't want to have the image of the Muslims , you know , if they do n't like something you say , they kill you , because it 's not . It was a noisy crowd outside the Danish embassy in London as speakers condemned the cartoons portraying the Prophet Mohammed . I wish I could get your music in America , but considering how controversial it 's been here in England ... Initially , when I did
zone2	but then , in the current times that we 're in , people got really scared . It just shows the stupidity of society , which refuses to discuss , debate things in an intelligent way . And I do n't except that . I just put my middle finger up . One of your big gripes ... and it 's a valid one ... you keep saying that ... in fact , let me read your quote . You said , " Anyone worried about what I 'm saying should get involved in the debate . You are allowed to dissent . - That is a right . " - Yeah . But is that a right in Islam , to dissent ? Of course it is . Why do you think there 's so many schools of thought ? - Why do you think there 's ... - It was n't a right for Salman Rushdie . The demonstrators set off from Hyde Park , bringing much of central London to a standstill . Their hatred focused on Salman Rushdie and his book . The mullahs pressed home
zone2	be killed . See , Salman Rushdie was there to provoke , insult , and he did it intentionally , right ? But should you die for that ? No no , well , I mean , like , that was ... you know , it 's easy for you to say things are kind of in black and white . They 're more complex than that . There 's emotions and passions and philosophy involved - and all that stuff . - You know , all you got ta say is it 's wrong for someone to have to suffer a death threat - for writing a book . - Well , hang on . But apparently , it 's more complicated than that . Well , it is because ... but I mean , Western ... We 'll never see eye to eye there , but you want that protection for yourself . No , I think these debates are a lot ... I 'm willing to discuss ' em in terms of facts and not fictions . When you disagree with me , it 's a fiction
zone2	- and I have the fiction . - No , I do n't have the truth . But you do n't see that there 's a fundamental hypocrisy of you asking for the right to dissent and somebody else getting a death threat ? No no , ' cause my dissent is to stop the madness . I 'm here with Geert Wilders here in The Hague , which of course is home to the World Court , but also to the Dutch Parliament . You are taking a kind of hard line here in the Netherlands . Islam is , according to me , a violent religion . The Koran is a violent book and Mohammed was a violent prophet . Do you think Islam wants to take over the world ? - They do n't even make ... - Right right . ... a secret about it . We are infidels . I mean , we should either become Islamic or we should be killed . This is what they say . This is what they are proud of . Okay , we 're here at Habibi Ana
zone2	. You guys , really ... I mean , gay Muslim activists , that is a very rare job description . You guys have balls . How big is the gay community ... the gay Muslim community here in Amsterdam ? Or is this it ? I mean , I 'm guessing , Thursday is n't ... is n't gay night here . I hope you guys find each other attractive , ' cause otherwise ... you do n't feel afraid ? Here in Holland I 'm not , but when I came from my country , I was very afraid . There was an article of law : Punish the gay for one year just because he 's gay . - Just being gay can get you a year . - Just being gay . Same as Alabama . What I learned is that they 're not really ... they 're not specific against homosexuality . They 're not specific against , in other words , the desire of a man for a man . What they are against is specific behavior , like anal sex . They do
zone2	want you doing it in the naughty place , which I guess , if you put that out of the picture in homosexuality , what do you have left ? Just the blowjob . What do you think when people say it affects your memory , especially your short-term memory ? - It does . - And what do you think when people say that it affects your memory , your short-term memory ? It does . - I like my hat . - It 's good . You look good , too . I think I do . I think I might adopt this look . Yes . Is there a reason why you have a black hat and I have a white hat ? We have any color you like . So I bought this . I like it myself because I like the color . There is a lot of tension in the last five years or so . Is Islam a threat to Dutch values ? Islam is preaching , above all , peace . Peace , peace and peace . The name Islam means peace
zone2	war and violence . Yeah , it 's just all politics . - Nothing to do with religion ? - No no . - No ? - No , sir . - It 's political . - It 's politics . Seems to be a lot of passages that say the infidel is not the equal of the believer . The infidel will die in hell . Do n't feel bad about hating the infidel . - No . - No ? Boy , I 've got bad information . Yes , you have . I think so . - No no no no no . - No no no no . - No no no no . - No . No ? No . I 'm wrong about everything . The way I perceive things in the Koran is not about killing infidels . - But you have read it in there ? - Of course I 've read the Koran . You 've read those passages , and what did you think when you read them ? No , but I explain those passages within the time in
zone2	how people read holy books . People do n't read holy books and go , " Well , that was good for then . " People who read holy books and go , " This is the word of God . It 's forever ! " - No , I do n't agree . - That 's how most people do it . I just do n't buy it that these guys are in this state of denial . I think they 're just in a state of denial to an outsider . They will not admit anything is wrong with their culture to an outsider . Muslims were imperialists in the century after Mohammed 's death . They conquered most of the known world in one century . Yeah , it is possible . You call it conquer . I think they were trying to spread Islam . Well , they were , but they were n't doing it by singing " Kumbaya . " Excuse me . Sorry . Oh , that 21st century 's always busting in . I 'm going to shut it off . I
zone2	his ringtone . Okay , I shut it off . - Sorry , I was ... - Yeah ... Politics , okay . Do you think it 's possible that when we 're on something like marijuana or mushrooms and believe we 're having a very spiritual experience , that we 're just high ? - It 's ... it 's ... - Oh , look out your head 's on fire ! Boy , talk about the light bulb going off , - that was your whole head . - I do n't like candles behind me . No . Oh , look , I found another joint . Uh-oh . Can we get closer ? That is one hell of a wall . This is the Dome of the Rock ? This is the Dome of the Rock . According to Islam ... On a horse ? He went to heaven on the horse ? Why is it holy for the Jews ? A rock . The Kaaba ? Is n't that ... Stone , rock , the same thing . Why is that holy ? Paradise .
zone2	to be like a meteor ? But does it make a difference that we now understand what a meteor is ? Yes , right . Okay . This is the Mount of Olives . A lot of Orthodox Jews want to be buried here , ' cause they believe that when the Messiah comes , he will raise them from the dead and march them through that golden gate and onto the Temple Mount , which is why the Muslims have walled up the gate . The better to keep out the Jewish Messiah and his kosher zombies from getting in . Although you 'd think that if you had the power to raise the dead , you 'd have the power to jump a fence . I thought I would not be allowed to walk in a mosque . I thought only someone of your faith was allowed to do that . Why is he angry ? They 're angry that you 're talking to me ? Women in your culture seem not to be as equal to the man as they are in our culture . Yes .
zone2	said that Mohammed had a meeting here . Mohammed never set his foot on that Temple Mount , not even one foot . Never ever . He was never in the land of Israel , that 's a historical fact . I think even I understand that . Why ca n't the people of the different faiths get along ? All three religions consider the same site to be holy . Is it not because it was conquered many times ? - Yes . - It was conquered first by King David , and then later by the armies coming out of the Arabian Desert . - It changed hands during the crusades . - We had the Romans . We had the Byzantines . We had the Persians . There 's more than one mosque in the world that used to be a church , and before that was a temple . Because it 's a lot easier just to change the sign on the top and say " under new management " than it is to change the whole building . I worked a lot of comedy clubs
zone2	on the ceiling . And in the ' 90s , they became strip clubs and now they 're a Starbucks . I 've come today to the village of Cerne Abbas in Southern England to show you something completely different . It 's in the shape of a giant naked man with a sizable erection ... well , sizable for England . Some people think that this means that there is a giant actually buried under that hill . Others think it has something to do with crop circles or ancient space visitors or Druids , but nobody really knows . And that 's what I find fascinating about this , is that it does n't really mean anything . The locals have been maintaining it for centuries , and they do n't really know why . They just do it because they 've always done it , and is n't that religion for you ? Sometimes you kneel , sometimes you fast and sometimes you go up on the hill and you cut the grass around the giant space penis . Do you believe , as so many Christians
zone2	think we are in the end times . There are many many signs . The world as we know it will come to an end . And beyond that , there will be the glorious second coming of Jesus Christ . It seems peaceful , but this is the very spot where a lot of Christians believe life on earth will end . The irony of religion is that because of its power to divert man to destructive courses , the world actually could come to an end . A lot of people in this country believe in end times . There will be this great reckoning , the Rapture . - Do you believe that ? - I do . But if you believe that the world is gon na come to an end , and perhaps any day now , does it not drain one 's motivation to improve life on earth while we 're here ? The plain fact is , religion must die for mankind to live . The hour is getting very late to be able to indulge in having key decisions made by religious
zone2	the ship of state not by a compass , but by the equivalent of reading the entrails of a chicken . George Bush prayed a lot about Iraq , but he did n't learn a lot about it . I do n't know that much about politics , I 'll vote for President Bush because of his faith . Faith means making a virtue out of not thinking . It 's nothing to brag about . And those who preach faith and enable and elevate it are our intellectual slaveholders , keeping mankind in a bondage to fantasy and nonsense that has spawned and justified so much lunacy and destruction . Religion is dangerous because it allows human beings who do n't have all the answers to think that they do . Most people would think it 's wonderful when someone says , " I 'm willing , Lord . I 'll do whatever You want me to do . " Except that since there are no gods actually talking to us , that void is filled in by people with their own corruptions , - limitations and agendas .
zone2	not saying necessarily nuclear ... The Lord did n't say nuclear ... but I do believe it 'll be something like that . And anyone who tells you they know ... they just know what happens when you die , I promise you , you do n't . How can I be so sure ? Because I do n't know , and you do not possess mental powers that I do not . The only appropriate attitude for man to have about the big questions is not the arrogant certitude that is the hallmark of religion , but doubt . Doubt is humble , and that 's what man needs to be , considering that human history is just a litany of getting shit dead wrong . Jesus is coming back to rescue the Jews , because he is the only one that can . The believer goes in the paradise . Unbeliever , they will go to hell . The Jews are the only reason that I am a Christian . - I love them . - But you 're not gon na take them - to heaven with
zone2	go in the Rapture , and I 'm gon na come back on a white horse . So you think Jesus will end this earth at some point , maybe in your lifetime ? One always hopes . This is a sign , and that is a sign . If a nuclear bomb went off , and it seemed like that was exactly what it had said , balls of fire or something , you would n't look on that as necessarily a bad thing . I know I 'll be with God . This is why rational people , anti-religionists , must end their timidity and come out of the closet and assert themselves . And those who consider themselves only moderately religious really need to look in the mirror and realize that the solace and comfort that religion brings you actually comes at a terrible price . It says in the last days there 'll be wars , rumors of wars . The Bible prophesies from the Book of Revelation ... they 're going to be fulfilled ! Can this be accomplished without violence ? - No .
zone2	Who will win out ? - We 'll win . That 's for God to decide on Judgment Day . If you belonged to a political party or a social club that was tied to as much bigotry , misogyny , homophobia , violence and sheer ignorance as religion is , you 'd resign in protest . To do otherwise is to be an enabler , a Mafia wife , with the true devils of extremism that draw their legitimacy from the billions of their fellow travelers . If the world does come to an end here or wherever , or if it limps into the future , decimated by the effects of a religion-inspired nuclear terrorism , let 's remember what the real problem was : That we learned how to precipitate mass death before we got past the neurological disorder of wishing for it . That 's it . Grow up or die . We are in a conflict between good and evil . See you in heaven . Who knows ? Yeah , exactly . Subtitles by LeapinLar
zone2	3506069 Montana . They call it the Treasure State or Big Sky Country . For most kids , it was a magnificent wonderland of adventure . But for me , it was 94 million acres of endless Froggy Doo stories told by my tag-along little brother . Did you know Froggy Doo has 14 diplomas ? How come you do n't have any , Elliott ? It 's sad that you do n't have any . Did you know Happy Herb ca n't swim ? Did you know every day 's a birthday on The Froggy Doo Show ? I 'm going to be on The Froggy Doo Show for my birthday ! Did you know Froggy Doo is the smartest one in town ? Did you know Froggy Doo likes horses ? He 's my best friend . Our town of Peaks View was a sleepy little hamlet , tucked far away from the changes rocking the rest of the world . Nothing much ever happened there , and that 's just the way folks liked it . We did have one claim to fame , though . Actually , make that two . Happy Herb and Froggy Doo

My mom , like most women back then , was realizing that the era of June Cleaver was over . Mick , get up ! You 're going to be late ! " Mick , you 're going to be late . " Morning .

Your dad 's a cop ? - Yeah , but he likes boxing . That 's good . Mine hates cops . Really , why ? He 's a rebel , I guess . Okay . Okay . You did n't come all the way over here just to tell me that your dad hates cops , did you ? I miss you , Froggy . Where are you ? Rocky , I got somebody to help us find Froggy Doo . Really , who ? - Come on . I hope it 's not a girl . I ca n't believe you asked a yucky girl . Wow . That 's Happy Herb 's and Froggy Doo 's house . The bestest house in town . - Come on . Look . Froggy 's motorcycle ! Yeah . Sport , stay . Hey , it 's the Genie . You

How did you know who you were , sir ? Because my name is Rocky . - It 's nice to see you , Rocky . We 're going to find Froggy Doo . - I hope you do . Well , just so you know , I 'm only in it for the reward . I guess he must be too old for talking frogs and such . Yeah . - Not us . We love Froggy Doo . He 's a good frog . - Yeah , he is . Lemonade
zone2	welcome . Happy Herb , why do n't you just make another one ? Another one ? Anyone ever say to Geppetto , " Hey , why do n't you make another Pinocchio ? " No . It 's all right , Herb . I 'm sorry , it 's just that Herb 's very attached . Well , we do n't have children of our own . So you kids and Froggy Doo are our children . Did n't know that . - Come here for a minute . Now , Rocky , do you have a plan to find Froggy Doo ? No , he does . Well , this is where he sleeps . Wow ! But I thought he lived in the pumpkin patch . No . That 's just on TV . He lives here with me . Yeah . Is this what you 're looking for ? Perfect . Here , boy . Okay , boy . Got it ? Got it ? Sport 's got a good sniffle . - Get him . Go get him . Wait for me ! Wait for

Froggy 's case must ... Must have been dragged
zone2	dragged into what ? Hey , who are those people ? Come on , back inside ! So you 're the manager , are you ? - Oh , no , I 'm just the assistant manager . My uncle 's the one that actually owns the place . So , it 'll all be yours someday , huh ? The way he rides me , I 'm lucky he lets me shop there . Just the one entrance into the stage ? Yeah , the dressing room 's in the back . How they could have gotten him out of there , case and all ? You 'd have to be a magician to pull that off . A magician , eh ? - Why is the FBI involved in this ? Extortion 's a federal crime , son . - Extortion ? Yeah , they sent Happy Herb a ransom note . Even sent the little fellow 's bow tie . - Ransom ? Listen , we 're going to catch whoever did this . The FBI is on top of it , so do n't you worry
zone2	, I 'll just walk back , guys . All righty . - Thanks . Okie-dokie . Do n't you kids have some lawns to mow ? Or dolls to play with ? - Dolls ? You mean like Froggy Doo ? This must be quite a case for you . Are you going to find Froggy Doo ? You can count on it , son . - Me , too ! All right . Nice hat , kid . Now why do n't you two go home to your mommies ? We 've got some work to do . Hey ! The FBI is a public agency . That means you work for me . So , did you come up with a motive yet ? People are driven by only one of two motives , kid , greed or revenge . It 's human nature . Do n't forget to brush your teeth , son . The last time we saw him , he was backstage . And when you went back to your dressing room to get the puppet , it was gone ? Please , you
zone2	Herb , that 's what it is . No , he happens not to be a puppet , he happens to be ... Herb ! To be a marionette . One , two ... Hello . If you want him back , it 'll cost you $500 . No , make it $1,000 . You went to the Feds . Well , where is he ? What have you done with him ? Just have the money ready by tomorrow night . We 'll call back with the drop location . Keep him on the line . Okay . Sir , sir , could I talk with him , please ? Just to tell him that ... Did you get it ? - Did you get it ? Old Faithful 's . Hi , Roxie . Yeah , still here .

Somebody 's got to bring home the bacon . Mom does . She gets it at Spreen 's . Do n't you worry , pal . He 'll be back . Good night , pal . Trixie agrees with the Feds . - Yeah , so do the Hardy Boys . It always boils down to either greed or revenge . But the only problem is everybody loves Happy Herb . Are you sure ? I mean , Happy Herb has no enemies ? I know , Binky 's the enemy of Happy Herb . Binky ,
zone2	Froggy was taken ? You 're as bad as the Feds . Like I told them , what makes you think I had anything to do with it ? You had the motive . Eliminate the competition . Yeah . I also have an alibi . I was right here prepping my show when it happened . You know , the truth is I 've always admired Herb . There 's a guy , he 's never been in it for the money . Well , maybe you had an accomplice . Why ? This is the worst thing that could have happened to my show . With Froggy Doo gone , the slicksters at the network , they 're going to be all over us . They 're going to make Bublin and the bean counters over at Channel 8 an offer they ca n't refuse , and in a matter of time , same thing 's going to happen here . Kids , with Froggy Doo gone , you 're looking at a dead man . Maybe Froggy Doo 's back ? Really , I wish I could

Just shut up ! - Come on , everyone . Elliott , that was just like Dad . I am not like Dad . Now just leave me alone , okay ? Elliott ? - What ? Froggy 's not fakey , is he ? - No , he 's
zone2	Any ideas ? - You 're supposed to find Froggy Doo . What do you think I 'm doing , stupid ? Why do you talk to him like that ? - Like what ? You 're always calling him names , like stupid or birdbrain . He 's my brother , that 's what we do . Well , that 's stupid . - Yeah , that 's stupid . Like I care ! Ike and Tina Turner , The Modern Folk Quartet , Dusty Springfield , The Ronettes , Bo Diddley , and special guest star , David " The Man From UNCLE " McCallum . It 's so far out , it 's in .

Wadell , it 's Hardigan . It 'll all be over tonight . Be sure to tell Mr . Hoover in your report that ... Tell them I say hello . ... we cracked this case in less than 2 days . Yes , sure .

Well , we 're already stationed in New Jersey , how much worse can it get ? - Do n't even ask that question . Our only hope is to find that puppet . Well , technically , it 's a marionette , sir . - Oh , it 's a marionette . Yeah . - It 's not a puppet ? No , sir , puppets are operated from underneath , with a hand , whereas the marionette is operated from above ... Do n't make me shoot you ! Can I get some syrup ? I 'm famous . Hey ! Hey , Mom ! Mom , did Dad see this ? I 'm famous . No , but when he does , he 'll probably whup you for sneaking out last night . I made the front page . I 'm a hero . You 're no hero , Elliott . Froggy
zone2	investigation 's not over . Hi . Can we talk to him ? Why do n't you kids just let it lie ? He 's out by the pumpkin patch . - See , I told you it was real . Hi , Happy Herb . - Hi . Happy Herb , how heavy was Froggy Doo 's case ? I found some scratch marks , and I think they might have been made by it . I would say it 's about 35 pounds , then you add Froggy Doo , forty-one-and-a-half pounds , I 'd say . Very much like you , huh ? Elliott , control your dog or I 'll call the pound ! Sport ! Go sit down ! Do n't worry , Happy Herb . My brother promised he 'd find Froggy Doo . That 's a great thought , but he 's not going to be able to do that . Oh , yes , he can .

What 's wrong with you ? Do you like seeing your name in the paper so much that you would risk Rocky getting hurt ? - No , it 's not what you think .

Good . - All right . I missed you , Dad . - Are you okay ? Oh , yeah . You ought to see the other guy . Does it hurt ? - Nah ! Take more than that to put the hurt on your old man . Hey , Rox .

See , he lights the fire , then while everybody 's looking the other way , he grabs the case and throws it in the dumpster . But who is he ? - That 's what we 've got to figure out . Wally knows everybody who worked that day . Come on . Thanks , Orin . - Okay , bye guys . Good luck . Two pounds of potatoes , one box Shredded Wheat .

In the east , pioneer settlers from the distant Celtic and Scottish lands settled in the rugged Appalachians . Life was hard for these proud , rugged people . Blood was thicker than water , and their conflicts were often settled in pounds of flesh -- where an eye for an eye was an unspoken duty toward preserving family honor . Rightin ' the wrongs done to family was common . Feelings toward the neighboring Cherokee ran both hot and cold . Some called them " brother , " and some called them " savages .

I think I have an idea how to loosen [Will] up . [laughing] Dear Almighty Father , it 's me , [Violet] . I 've never been in a church before , so forgive me if I do something wrong . I ask that you send your healing hand down to touch my pa , Harmon Teaster . Have mercy and do n't call him home yet . He 's an honest [man] and always a good husband and father . Do n't ask to save others . You might put me out of business . Elmer Inlow 's the name . Folks round here call me [Digger] . I do [all] the burying when duty calls .

I have n't seen you around here before , have I ? No . I do n't blame you . This used to be a family town . Now , it 's gotten worse and worse . I used to see more kids like that with fractured arms , climbing trees . Now I 'm doing mostly [gunshot] wounds . I did n't see too many women and children when I came into town . They 're hiding . The sheriff has no control over what goes on here . Drunks are running around on the street [all] day and [all] night . If you 're traveling by yourself , you better be careful . I will . Um ... I 'm gon na wrap this up . Do you want some ... Freshen up ? Or , uh , can I make you something
zone2	on the freshen . Thank you . Are you damn sure she said Harmon Teaster ? I 'm sure as day , Mr . Burnett . - Leave . - Now , Mr . Burnett ... Take off ! [laughing] Yeah .

I reckon not . [Whiskey] [Captain] . Sir , Mr . Burnett 's looking [all] over for you . I was just up with him a short time ago . Yes , sir . Well , he says it 's important . [sighs] Here , I 'll take that . This should keep it safe for the journey . Take one spoonful every hour . Okay ? That fever just might break . Thank you so very much . How
zone2	sound ? Thank you , Doctor . Bye . Sorry I 'm late . I put my pa down to bed . What are we having this little meeting for ? Maybe we 're [all] getting a raise . - [laughing] - Yeah , a raise . [Victor] Silence ! Some of you know that my parents were murdered . As well as many of the citizens of this town some years back . That 's right . It was by that one Harmon Teaster fella . Quiet ! - [giggling] - [Victor] Get out of here . It has just been brought to my attention that this [man] who was never brought to justice is still alive . And his daughter walks these very streets as we speak . [Moose] I done seen a strange girl in town . Ai n't that right , Joe ? Saw her head into Doc 's office . Well , I want that girl brought to me . A hundred dollars to anyone who brings her here immediately . [Whiskey] Let 's do it . - You want the girl unharmed ? -
zone2	You say something to me , General ? Hell with you , Yankee . Not my fault you fought on the wrong side . Confederate forever . The last shot of the war rang out right over in Waynesville . Confederacy 's dead . I still be hearing the echo . - Good day , General . - [Captain] . - Howdy , [Will] . - Hey , Tom . How you doin ' ? All right . What you working on ? Just tinkering with a few things here and there . Mm . Place is looking mighty fine . Yeah ? Thank you . It 's coming along . So what brings you down here ? Oh , I , uh - - I just , uh ... come in to , uh ... reflect a little . You need to talk about something ? Well ... I feel peculiar talking to you about this . That 's on account of my pa , ai n't it ? [Will] , how can you be such a decent , honest [man] when your pa 's the way he is
zone2	parents were [all] murdered . Hmm ... But , uh , that do n't account for the way he was before they were killed . You were there ? Uh ! I saw enough . I know ... the truth about what happened with Harmon Teaster . His pa was the law around here . And your pa ... had done gotten himself into some bad trouble . What kind of trouble ? [exhales] Well , [Will] ... He got drunk on shine and killed some Indian boy . And , uh , Harmon Teaster 's pa , [Ransom] , he was dead set on having your pa stand trial for what he 'd done . Then your granddaddy , Big [John] Burnett , wickedly set his men upon [Ransom] Teaster . The whole town saw what happened . No [man] should have suffered that way . And Harmon Teaster witnessed that merciless killing from a jail cell window . Somehow he escaped , and when he came back a few nights later ... he brought down a vengeance on your family and [all] the men responsible that is legendary
zone2	town into a ghost town . I never heard the part about the lawman before . Well , I reckon ... they left some of the facts out . Reckon so . Now , your pa was hell-bent on striking back . But [all] the Burnett gun hands were dead . So he went around to other towns and raised a small army of cutthroats . They started out looking for Harmon Teaster . Never found him . Now , legend says that he hid himself out in some mountain den for years . Others say he took in with the Cherokee . Do n't you think that he 'd be dead by now ? May be . But secrets do n't always stay buried . [Will] ... this town is as bad now as it ever was . Maybe worse . Now , I know I should do something . But I saw what they did to that other lawman ... [Ransom] Teaster ... I 'm afraid . Tom , if you 're afraid , why do n't you just leave ? Oh , I can run from different
zone2	Your pa and his boys are getting way out of hand . The people of this town are looking for help . What are you gon na do ? I have no clear path in sight . So ... I come to pray . I know it 's been a long time , but ... maybe He 'll still listen to an old [man] with a badge seeking to do the right thing . Well , Tom , I 'm gon na let you sit here and reflect . - Thanks , [Will] . - No . Thank you . Almighty God ... hear my prayer . Do you have an appointment ? No . We 're looking for a little lady that was seen coming in here . She still here , Doc ? Excuse me . I have sensitive materials here . Sensitive ? Sensitive materials ... for a sensitive [man] . I 'm getting real sensitive about finding this girl , Doc . Hell , [Bobcat] , that ai n't the right word . [Dr._Morrison_chuckles] She 's not here . [Whiskey] She was here . She ai

You 're always getting out-drawn . How you gon na like it when I have a needle and thread , when I got ta take some lead out of your ass ? What are you saying , Doc ? [Jim_Dandy] Doc 's right , [Bobcat] . We have n't seen you hit anything you was aiming at in a long time . [laughing] Doc 's sewn you up at least a half dozen times . [laughing] See what I mean ? You 'd be having Doc pick lead from you if [Digger] did n't get to you first . Hell , he 's just telling some truth . Doc 's kept you from bleeding to death on many occasion . All right , boys . Just tell us where the lady is , Doc . I honestly do n't know . Hell , she 's got to be in town somewhere . Let

[Pete] I 'll talk to [Victor] . - [Victor] ? - He 's harsh , I know . But he 's also a businessman . He 'll listen to reason . That Yankee mercenary working for him shows no respect . For anybody or anything ! Pa , are we gon na be okay ? You mind your chores , boy . Shh . We have customers . [Betsy_Mae] I 'm terribly sorry . Can I help you find anything ? [Violet] I 'm picking up a few little things . This is amazing that you have [all] this in one place . You 've never been to a general store ? No . My uncle and pa took me to a trappers ' gathering once , but it was nothing like this . Pa ? I think we got trouble . So this is where you 've been hiding . This horse is a nag . You
zone2	I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday , son . Thank you . I 've had a half dozen people out trying to find you so I could have a word with you today . I do n't know why you defy me so . Is n't there something in that Good Book about respecting thy father ? You trying to tell me now that you 've read the Good Book ? I 've read a line or two here and there . I know we do n't always see eye to eye and I may not be the ideal parent , but I 've always tried to provide and help make you into a [man] . Yeah . You 've helped me decide what kind of [man] I never want to be . [laughing] [Will] ! These people do n't respond to [all] that religious guilt bullshit . They need authority from someone who can give punishment . Direct punishment and reward . You sound like you 're trying to fill in for God . - Is that what you 're trying to do ? - Enough

Hold on , fellas . You mind telling me what 's going on out here ? A bit of family business . [Victor] . Now you got to understand . It does not look good for people to be dragged off the streets of this town in the middle of broad daylight like that .

zone2	dilated . Did you , uh ... - What ? - take some drug ? Drugs ? No . I 've seen that kind of dilation before with opium addicts . Opium ? I do n't do opium . I do n't even use tobacco . Something does n't add up . Look , Tom , you know that I 'd never kill anybody in cold blood . You were in a frenzy . You just kept firing and spinning around till you fell down . When your gun was empty , you just fainted dead away . [door_closes] Drop the gun , [Will] . Drop the iron , [Will] ! - It 's [all] right , Tuck . - The hell it is ! Wilson 's dead , and you got a hole in you as well . [sighs] I have reason to believe that [Will] was drugged . Well , that does n't excuse his actions , now , does it ?

Oh , Lord , what have I done ? # Travel this long journey # # Through its many turns # # Looking to the heavens # # When peace is [all] you want # # Feel this life around you # # Your spirit makes you strong # # Your mother 's eyes upon you # # Wind sings her spirit song # So you 're still here . You did n't run off with that little whore . You should have ! You 're a disgrace to me . Weak bastardly seed . You 're too soft ! I 've given you everything but the stern hand you really needed . And you have no respect for the way of things - - a legacy that was born of blood in this town before you were born . I love her , Pa , and Ma
zone2	she cried , but she would not tell us where her pa was . Yeah ... [chuckles] not even when we cut her . [laughing] What ? What kind of sick [man] are you ? Same as my son , boy . [chuckles] Whoo ! [laughing] There might be hope for you yet , but you got a lot to learn . And the first is who runs this town . That [man] is me . Boys , do n't kill him , but teach him what happens when someone betrays us . Better take him outside . We would n't want to offend anyone in here , would we ? [Moose] He 's mine ! No pistol this time , church boy . - [men_shouting] - Get down there ! Pray now , church boy . Pray now ! His ass deserves it ! - That 's what his ass gets ! - Wise up , [Will] ! - [Moose] Give me my hat ! - Get his hat . [laughs] Not too great , [Will] . Not too great . [laughing] [laughs] [grunts] Hey , [Will] . [groans]

[sobbing] I 'm so sorry . [sobbing] I 'll go water the horses . [Captain] , mount up the men . We 'll see if we can pick up their trail . No need to go looking for Harmon Teaster . Trapper saw Teaster down on Campbell Creek . He 's coming . He 's going to kill us [all] . Shut up , [Digger] ! He 'll bring his vengeance down on [all] of us . One more word , and you wo n't have to worry about Harmon Teaster . I 'll put you in one of your own boxes . Go fetch the doc , now ! - Is she sleeping ? - Yes . I 've already fed and watered the horses . Let 's give ' em an hour or two , and we 'll
zone2	years ago , that was n't my blood and it was none of my business , but this is . I 'm ... I 'm sorry I did n't make it there in time . You 're going to need my help . Harm , you 're getting old . [laughs] Well , well . Business looks good , Doc . You got the shooter and the shot [all] together now . [laughs] [Moose] is over at the saloon . Needs a sew-up when you get time . You [all] are awful jolly for a couple of dead men . What you spouting off ? Harmon Teaster is coming for [all] of you who wronged his daughter . Know that . [laughs] You hear this crazy talk , [Bobcat] ? What , you ai n't buying this stuff are you ? I was up to a ... trappers ' gathering a couple of summers ago . I heard it . Th-This Teaster fella , the one that murdered [Victor] 's kin ? I was around here then . So was [Digger] and a few others . Ask them . He
zone2	kill you [all] . Now , let 's wait a damn minute . We 're just talking about one [man] , right ? [Bobcat] They say he took up with a Cherokee . They consider him to be a [man] of powerful medicine . They say he 's ... half grizz ... the other half being mountain lion . The horses are packed and ready . - [liquid_pouring] - Here you go . That 's quite a lump you got on your head there , boy . [Judd] Doc 'll have to sew that head up . All this over some Injun girl . That Injun girl is the daughter of a [man] who so brutally slaughtered a gang of men that they renamed this town after his deeds . So Ghost Town has n't always been the name of this town ? No . As I recollect , it used to be called Maggie Valley or some such . Well , maybe he 's dead , hmm ? - Maybe he is . - [footsteps] [Whiskey] , [Judd] . - You gon na sit a spell ? - No
zone2	Why are you so jittery ? I ai n't jittery . I was , uh ... talking with General Martin and , uh ... I mean , I was thinking I might head west . Thinking of going west , are you , Joe ? Well , yes , sir , Mr . Burnett . I mean , I was thinking about it . This would n't have anything to do with Harmon Teaster , would it ? Oh , no , sir . I was just thinking about change . I see . You want your pay , Joe ? Well , I was n't going to ask for it . I mean , I -- Joe , please . Let me pay you what I owe you . [body_thuds] All right . Listen up if you want to stay alive . Yes , there is reason to believe that Harmon Teaster will be coming to town looking for revenge . When he murdered those men who worked for my father [all] those years ago , he came in the night and he butchered them while they slept .
zone2	comes , we 'll kill him and his mountain legend once and for [all] . - Do you hear me ? - Yes , sir . Good . Someone fetch [Digger] . Excuse me , buddy . Could you tell me where the Red Dog Saloon is ? Yeah , it 's right over - - [wolf_howls] [thunderclap] [Victor] ! [Victor] ! I got this telegram . County Marshal Morgan Duckett 's coming here . Who sent for him ? You ? I do n't know who sent for him . Maybe it was the sheriff . Maybe it was one of his deputies . This whole thing 's getting out of hand . - I said I 'd take care of it . - You 'd better do that . I do n't like your tone , boy . Well , I 'm sorry to hear that , [Victor] . But I do n't happen to like the way things are getting sloppy around here . I mean real sloppy . Hmm . Come on . Damn ! A marshal . You seen [Moose] ? I saw him leave
zone2	know . He said he was going to the doc , but the doc ai n't seen him . You do n't say . You know , you do n't think that , uh ... What you askin ' ? Teaster . Harmon Teaster . Ai n't you afraid , old [man] ? He do n't got nothing against me , and I got nothing against him . Walters ? I found him . I found [Moose] . Actually , he found him . Come on . He was already dead when someone hauled him up here . It was n't no someone . We [all] know who it was . Oh , God ! Please , oh , please do n't let me die like that . Oh , please . " Oh , please do n't let me die . " [Will] you shut up ! He ai n't gon na listen to you ! This is just one [man] playing this game . [Moose] was drunk and wounded . That made him easy prey . Well , somebody cut the poor devil down . You stay here
zone2	. [panting] Pa ? Uncle ? Pa ? [Will] . It 's started , has n't it , Doc ? They found [Moose] [all] strung up at the church . [grunts] " Vengeance is mine , sayeth the Lord . " - Has he been awake yet ? - Starting to stir a little . You got a problem ? - [Jackknife] # O Death # - I do n't like this . # O Death # # Wo n't you spare me over till another year # # O Death # # O Death # # Wo n't you spare me over till another year # Pa , do you have to sing that song right now ? - What ? - It is getting late , and Spits ai n't back yet . Well , maybe he got hung up praying . - [laughs] - That ai n't funny , Pa . There 's something that 's going on out there ' cause I can feel it . Well , at least you feel something . Now , listen to old [Jackknife] . Whether you 're dead or
zone2	alike . You do n't feel nothin ' ! [laughing] To [Moose] . [Whiskey] To [Moose] . Man , he 's a heavy one . - Come on . - You hear something , [Digger] ? [Digger] , is that you shooting at me ? Oh , Howard , I 'm sorry . I did n't know that was you . Shoot at me again , and I 'll kill you myself . I 'm sorry . Good night to you , [Digger] . It was just Howard . Take it easy . Now . Wait a minute . I got an idea . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Lay him down . Just lay him down . - Wait a minute . - Just leave him . I 'll get him later . I need a stiff drink . Come on . Say , [Captain] , no need to fear death . You just draw , and see who 's staying , and see who 's going , right ? This ai n't some cock walk to see who 's the fastest draw . He wants
zone2	Guess we 'll see who 's staying and who 's going . I fold . You know , it was n't right what we did to that girl . Listen to that bleeding heart when death 's near . Why do n't you shut the hell up . They 're not coming after me . Four aces . And I 'll shut up when you pay up . - Who the hell are you ? - Do n't shoot ! - What 's going on here ? - I 'm [Violet] Teaster . Are you Harmon and Susie Teaster 's daughter ? Yes , sir . We did n't mean to scare you , ma'am . I need to borrow a horse , please . All we have 's old Zeke there . Are you going into town ? Yes , sir . You think you might bring us back some tins ? Yes , I can do that . Thank you , ma'am . It 's so quiet . Hmm . They want to hear him coming . They ? Him ? You make him sound like the devil

No , I already got ta piss something mighty . Outhouse is right outside . [laughs] I 'd just as soon piss in this spittoon . This is crazy ! Sitting here , waiting for some mountain [man] to come here and kill us [all] off . I say if this old [man] wants a piece of Jim Dandy , then bring it ! Yeah ! Jim Dandy ai n't scared of you ! Where you hiding ? Harmon ! Harmon Teaster ! Where are you hiding ? Harmon ! Harmon Teaster ! Come on out , you old mountain buzzard ! I 'm right here ! [Jim_Dandy] Come on !

Jim Dandy 's dead . Dead ? [Captain] Best go clear the street , [Digger] . No . I ca n't go out there . He 'll kill me . Now Dandy 's dead . By God , I 'm not going down without a fight . Not without a fight ! You 're damn right . I 'm out of here . - What , no playing tonight ? - I do n't think so . Night , [Judd] . Night , boys . Good knowing you . What the hell did he mean by that ? Boys , I 'm running out back to relieve myself . Ai n't you scared ? I did n't do nothing wrong . Appears to be the witching ' hour , boys . [thunderclap] What the hell ? Ai n't that a bitch . [yelling] [coughing] [Digger] ! What about my pa
zone2	's going on around here ? Damn it ! Pa ! All right ! We 'll [all] stay here till the morning . Then , by God , it ends ! [thunderclap] What 's going on ? Go back to sleep , [Will] . It 'll be over in a little while . - [Will] What 's gon na be over ? - Go back to sleep , [Will] . [cocks_rifle] [Victor] ! - Let 's go . Let 's go . - [yelling] [Victor] Burnett !

Remember , you 've always got a place to come back to . Okay , little doll ? [Violet] I went on back to Ghost Town to study medicine with Doc Morrison . [Judd] revealed the truth about the opium drug [Victor] had used on his own son . Just look out there and see our beautiful Ghost Town . Think of [all] the corruption that 's gone now . Our mayor 's dead
zone2	. Law was soon reestablished with the arrival of Marshal Morgan Duckett . This Teaster fella , are we gon na go after him ? Sheriff ? No . All right . The families returned , and soon schoolhouses and churches replaced saloons and whorehouses . The town was officially renamed Maggie Valley . It seems that the past wrongdoings of Ghost Town would soon become like the name itself - - just something from the past .

So needless to say ... when Mel proposed , I said yes . - [Crowd_Laughs] - I did n't want to give her time ... to change her mind , so we have set a date . On May 31 , one month from today ... you are all invited to our open bar-- Which will also feature a wedding , but , you know- - [Laughing] [All] right , let 's get drunk . Hey , uh , [Derek] ?

It 's a gift . - So where are you from ? - Chicago . - I thought you were psychic . - It comes and goes . We 're from Chicago . - We just got married . - We eloped . - Can you believe it ? - I 'm beside myself with wonder . We 're taking a mule trip into the grand canyon this weekend .

This is late May . The question is n't where , the question is when and the answer is January . Early February at the latest . You could try the Ranger Station at Grand Canyon village , but I doubt they 'll tell you anything different . ( Sighs ) Yeah . Okay . Oh my God . So you do n't have any backcountry permits ? I 'm sorry , you should 've applied ... I know , I know , I should 've applied in January . Early February at the latest .

zone2	n't . I could n't help but overhear , seeing as I was eavesdropping and all . I just want to say that I 'm deeply moved by your dilemma . Now see , I 'm not one to really toot my own horn , but the fact of the matter is that . I 've done it all . I trapped beaver , I hunted bear , I panned for gold , I lived with the Indians and I 've been struck by lightning ... Twice . I 've been buried by rockslides , I 've been stung by scorpions , I 've been mauled by a Mountain Lion and I went a couple of rounds with a Grizzly before he give me this , but I took his left eye in return , so I guess you could say that we 're even . Jeez . And that ai n't the half of it , my friend . Who are you exactly ? I 'm the answer to your prayers . The name 's Pritchard , folks . Henry Theodore Roosevelt Pritchard , guide extraordinaire . I 've
zone2	I 've got the know-how and I 've got the Huevos . And I 'm hereby offering my expert services . Are you saying that you can take us down into the canyon ? Is a frog 's ass watertight ? ( Chuckles ) See , I used to be a guide for one of those bigger outfits , but we had a falling out over what I guess you might call creative differences . Mr . Conway : Can you get us a permit this late ? Oh , I can get you a permit . It 's all a question of greasing the right palms . Would you excuse us for just one second ? Well , sure . Take two . Live it up . Yeah . ( Clearsthroat ) I think I saw him on " America 's Most Wanted . " Well , the guy 's just a little eccentric . Eccentric is living in a house trailer with 37 cats , not stalking around with a meat cleaver strapped to your side . Mr . Conway : Yeah , but he can ... he

There 's fossils of Brachiopods , coral and mollusks in the Kaibab Limestone ... That 's the topmost layer . It is a relative youngster at 250 million years old , give or take a millennium . - Hey , Henry . - Yeah ? What do you know about John Wesley Powell ? John Wesley Powell , who lost his right arm at the battle of Shiloh and went on to become a famous explorer of the Grand Canyon ? - Yeah . - Never heard of him . - Okay . - Just yanking your bootheel , my friend . I 'm a regular encyclopedia when it comes to the venerable J.W . Powell . I have to get a picture of this . That qualify as a creative difference ? Shh . - Care to wet your whistle ? - Do n't mind if I do . Oh , come

Yeah , that might do it , tough guy . What ? This ai n't nothing . ( Mulebraying ) ( Chuckling ) Henry : You need some water . Come on and get some water . Yeah . - You like it ? - Mmm . I can see that . All right . Not too shabby , huh ? You see , when I saw him that time ... Some persons ... you know , a person goes
zone2	mauled by the same one three times . And the reason I know it was the same one is because he was a cross-eyed bobcat . I guess that 's what made him so ornery . He gave me this . - ( Rockssplashing ) - Oh my God . Yup . Did I ever mention I was bit by a mule ? Uh , no . Jeez . - What did you do ? - I bit him back . (

Things are finally starting to take shape , finally starting to form into place . I think that this could be a fresh start for the both of us . I know that working for my dad is n't exactly a dream come true ... No no , it 's good , it 's good . I mean , the job , the future ... It 's good . It 's all good . (

Did n't I read in one of those brochures that you 're required to stick to the permit ? Well , that 's actually more of a suggestion than a requirement . Up to you . Watch out . Listen , if you 're not cool with this , you just say the word , okay ? And we 'll ... you know , we 'll camp right here . I 'll even name the Creek after you , if you want . ( Whispering ) Come on . Come on . Come on . You want to do it . You want to do it . You want to do it . All right . Fine . Lead the way , Henry . - All right . - Let 's do it . All right .

A Mojave rattler ... the venom goes straight to the spinal cord . That ai n't a pleasant way to go . Is there anything that I can do ? Henry : Yeah , you know what you could do ? ( Beeps ) You could go see if you can corral them mules , especially the one that 's got our gear on it . - All right . - I do n't have a signal . Sometimes them things work up here and sometimes they do n't . I 'd be much obliged if you could maybe find some kind of piece of wood that I could use for a splint so I can immobilize my arm . It 's best if I stay still for a minute . Okay . Otherwise the venom 's gon na go directly into my system . Come here , boy . Come here . (

This all the matches you have left ? No , I 've got a lot more left in
zone2	. - Uh-huh . Yeah , along with the first aid kit , along with the food and water . - Shit . - You said it , my friend . That 's pretty good . - Good . - You all right ? Yeah . Whew . Is there anything more we can do for you , Henry ? No , just keep that fire going . I 'm starting ... I 'm starting to get the chills . So , Henry , what happens now ? Well , I 'll probably get a fever . I guess I 'll get dizzy , blurred vision . I 'll take leave of my senses at some point , though you might be hard-pressed to tell . You know , I think that we 'd best cook up them rattlers . The cupboard 's bare , folks , and we ca n't afford to be choosy . Will you help me ? Huh ? Here . Yeah . What do I do ? You just cut the connecting muscles around the anal vent to release the skin . ( Rattlingsoftly )
zone2	It tastes like chicken . No thanks , I 'm a vegetarian . ( Chuckles ) Since when ? Since I found out that thing had an anal vent . (
zone2	both_laugh ) ( Wolfhowling ) That 'd be Canis Lupus ... Western Timber Wolf ( Howlingcontinues ) looking for a date . ( Wolveshowling ) And I guess somebody got lucky . Sounds like they 're hunting . I did n't know there were wolves around here . Oh yeah . They 're here now . No place left for them to go . ( Howlinglouder ) We 've encroached on their territory for so long , ai n't hardly nothing left for them to eat , so sometimes they go looking for food in places . They 're just looking to survive , same as you and me . You screw with Mother Nature , she 's gon na find a way to screw you right back . On that note , I think I 'll try my cell phone again . ( Henryretching ) ( Yelling ) Hey , Henry , are you all right ? I
zone2	just ... - ( Yells ) ( Chuckles ) I 've got some chapstick in here somewhere . ( Laughing ) Oh , baby . All right . Well , we 'd best get a move on . Hey , darling , give me some of that chapstick . (
zone2	crow_cawing ) - Hush . - What is it , Henry ? Indians say that crows work in tandem with wolves , leading them to injured prey . The wolves feast and the crows get the leftovers . Oh . Oh , there it is . Lucky for me I ai n't no Indian . Hey , what else you got in that thing ? - ( Beeps ) - Sunscreen , Kleenex , spare battery for my camera and gum . Gum ? Ooh , you 've got gum . Come on . Fork it over . Yes . You want half ? - Thanks . - Thanks . Should n't we be at the Campground by now ? I do n't know . If I had known our human compass was gon na go haywire , I would
zone2	're lost , are n't we ? No , we 're not lost . Hello ! ( Echoing ) You 're not lost ! ( Echoing ) Feel better ? Not even remotely . ( Henrymumbling ) All right , let 's make camp . We 'll make it here . What if he does n't make it ? I 'm scared , Nick . ( Whispers ) Oh God . Henry : I see ' em ! I see ' em ! - I see ' em coming ! - Henry ! - I 've seen their wrath ! I see ... - ( Braying ) ( Yells ) Henry , what are you doing , man ? - All right , I 'll go get the mule . - Okay . - Henry ? - Oh , you ... oh my God . It ai n't that mother nature 's cruel . She do n't care one way or another about it . But make no mistake ... one way or another , she will have her day . Henry , we 'll get you to a hospital
zone2	) Oh , Henry , please do n't ... Henry ? No . (
zone2	crow_cawing ) Damn it . ( Panting ) He 's dead . (
zone2	wind_blowing ) (
zone2	crickets_chirping ) We ca n't just leave him here . Well , we ca n't carry his body out , not without a mule . We should bury him . We can notify the authorities when we get back . Better get to it . (
zone2	wind_blowing ) - Hi . - Hmm ? - Morning . - Hey . Mmm . Hey . Were you awake all night ? - Mmm , pretty much . - Oh no . ( Yawning ) We should head out that way . So long , Henry . ( Vulturecawing ) I want to paint the kitchen when we get back . You want to paint the kitchen ? White is so boring . It 's so safe . It 's so nothing . It should be more vibrant , more alive , like pumpkin or brick red or something . Anything but white , you promise me that we 'll paint the
zone2	, Lori . - Whatever you want . - I 'm serious . You promise me that we 'll paint the kitchen when we get back home . All right , I promise . I 'm not gon na die out here , Nick . No , thanks . I 'm all full . All right , come here . Give me a piece . Come on . Give me some . So which way ? Well , the Campground 's South of here . The sun 's headed that way , so that 's West . So South must be here . We go that way . As long as you 're sure . I 'm sure . Hey , look . ( Chuckles ) No . ( Sandtrickling ) Now that 's just plain cruel . How long do you think it 's been since we had anything to eat or drink besides gum ? I do n't know . What day is it ? Monday , I think . I had some rattlesnake Saturday night . Lucky you . Oh God , you know what I could
zone2	A pizza . I would n't say no to a pizza . Hello ? Oh , yeah , hi . I 'd like to order a large pizza , and can I get that with extra cheese ? Do n't forget the pepperoni and the sausage . Did you get that ? Great . Oh , by the way , - do you deliver ? - (
zone2	both_laughing ) You might as well try it while you have it out . You never know . ( Beeps ) Hey , I 've got a signal . Call 911 . ( Beeping ) - Shit . - What ? I lost it . Nick : What ? What what what ? - Anything ? - Damn it . It 's all right . It 's all right . It means we 're on the right track . ( Laughing ) What ? It 's gon na be checkout time at the Motel pretty soon . Something tells me we 're gon na be a little late . We told the manager we were going on a mule trip into the Canyon
zone2	" So when we do n't check out on time , she 's gon na realize that something is wrong and she 's gon na notify the Authorities . What ? The Motel Manager ? She would n't pour water on us if we were on fire . When we do n't show up by 11:00 she 's gon na charge us for another day . Yeah , but ... Are these the petroglyphs Henry was talking about ? ( Panting ) No . They 're , uh ... those are ... those are back there somewhere . Unless we just walked in a big circle . I do n't believe it . We 're farther from the Campground than when we started this morning . I ca n't believe I let you talk me into this . No . I asked if you were cool with this and you said yes . And what choice did I have ? You know , it 's like you 're on some kind of a mission . You 're always pushing it and you take stupid risks ! You never stop !
zone2	reality . Oh , I 'm facing it . Here it is , Lori ! Huh ? ! - All the reality you want ! - Yeah , thanks to you . You know , I came here only for you ! Look look , here it is . Here it is . Look at it . It 's all ours , huh ? ! Stop it ! Oh , I ... Let 's get out of here . It looks like we either head out that way ... Or we climb . ( Beeping ) Check this out . Okay , I 'm checking it out . What am I checking out ? - This is definitely doable . - Define " doable . " There 's plenty of handholds . Once we get to that ledge , we 'd scoot across this seam , shimmy up that crevice there , make our way up to the last rock face and voila , we 're at the top . - What do you think ? - Shimmy ? I think you 've been out in the sun too long
zone2	just like that wall I used to climb in that rock gym . You climbed it once , Nick . Yeah , and the instructor said I was a natural . Be careful . What did I tell you ? Piece of cake . Well , we might be able to get a phone signal from up there . We 'll have a much better chance of being spotted up there than down here . It 's our best option . We can do this . Then what are we waiting for ? Here 's a good one . Okay . ( Grunting ) ( Nickgrunting ) You all right ? Uh , yeah . Ask me again when we get to the top . Maybe ... maybe I should just try my phone from here . What ? No no , not now . Not now . - Yeah , now . - All right , make it quick . Okay . I need your help . Can you hold my hand ? - Okay , you got me ? - Yeah . Okay . ( Beeping ) -
zone2	( Ringing ) - It 's ringing . - Yeah ! - Woman : 911 . Hello ? Hello ? We need help . - Our guide is ... Hello ? - ( Beeps ) Hello ? I lost her . - It 's all right . Try again . - ( Beeping ) - ( Ringing ) - It 's ringing again . Woman : 911 . What 's your emergency ? - Hi , we 're lost in ... - ( Beeps ) Shit ! Shit ! I lost her again . All right . Put it on speaker and lean out . I 'll hold on . - Really ? - Yeah , I 've got you . Come on . You can do it . Okay . ( Beeping ) - Okay . Okay . - Go ahead . - Ready ? - Yeah . - Are you sure ? - Yeah . Okay okay . (

Really ? - ( Woodcreaking ) - Come on . - ( Snaps ) - ( Bothyell ) - Ah ! God ! - ( Mumbling ) How 's it look ? Not too bad . You 've always been a shitty liar . It 's okay . It 's a good quality to have in a wife . That bad , huh ? Any ideas ? I could go for help . Except we 're lost . What happened to your phone ? Your call went through before though , right ? Even if it did , I did n't get a
zone2	that I even know where we are . But Henry got us a permit , and when he does n't show up , they 're gon na know that we 're missing and they 're gon na send somebody to come looking for us , so it 's okay . Do you really think that Henry actually got a permit ? (
zone2	crow_cawing ) Do you remember the story of the guy who went hiking in ... God ... in Utah , I think it was ? (
zone2	inhales_deeply ) He fell ... Or maybe he got caught in a rockslide . I do n't remember , but anyway he got his arm pinned by a Boulder . He tried everything he could to free himself but nothing worked , so he cut off his own arm . I think that was different . No , it 's not that different . He was alone . And I have you . We 're one up on him . No , he had no choice , but we do . - Do we ? - Yes , we can , you
zone2	survived . I could too . Nick , you ... you ca n't cut off your foot . I know I ca n't ... But you could . No . No . No . The pain is like lightning running through my veins . I ca n't ... I ca n't do that . - I ca n't cut off ... - I saw a Wolf . What ? Here ? When you went looking for that piece of wood . Okay .

( Birdsquawking ) Let 's say that you 're right and we have to ... I have to cut your foot off . How exactly am I supposed to do that ? With Henry 's knife . We buried it . (
zone2	flies_buzzing ) How could I be so stupid ? I 'll go back and get the knife . - Forget it . - Come on . You said it yourself , if we do n't get you out of here , then you 're gon na die . You do n't know your way back to Henry 's grave . - I can try . - But what if you get lost ? Huh . I 'm already lost . - I 'm serious . - So am I . I can do this . No , I ca n't let you . Well , try and stop
zone2	was n't funny . Yeah , it was . That should be plenty . Here . - Huh . - Just in case . Great . Where are the marshmallows ? Well , I should get going .

zone2	3338333 So this is it . The end of the world . Hundreds of comets ... each the size of a small island ... each carrying the force of 1,000 nuclear warheads ... are about to come crashing ... on to the earth . We only have ourselves to blame . My name is ... Professor Neil Gant , ... I work for N.E.O . , ... NASA 'S Near Earth Object Programme . We track the debris of creation , ... the billions of comets and asteroids ... that still orbit our sun . And you 'll see that America 's very much in the line of fire ... Ourjob is to give advance warning of potential earth impacts . I ca n't sell your solution to the President and he ca n't sell it to the American people . I already let one disaster happen ... and now we face annihilation . I do not know how this story will end but it began a year ago , How do you do little Princess ? How do you do Mr . Kelly ? Ladies and gentlemen this is the Captain , we hope you 've enjoyed yourflight with
zone2	about ten minutes . I 'm the Queen of the Beach today , all the Lords and Ladies said ... Ladies and gentlemen , the fasten your seatbelts sign is on , please remain in your seats while we await informa of a change in weather conditions . Please do not be alarmed . Ladies and gentlemen , we will shortly begin ... our descent into Shannon Airport . Please remain in your seats at all times . You need to adopt the brace position immediately in preparation for emergency landing . Abort landing , pull up , pull up ! This is it , the epicentre . You 've been a participant in the biggest inter-dimensional cross-rip since the Tunguska blast in 1908 . I 'd like to get a sample of your brain tissue . Come on guys , you know the movie , who you gon na call ? Come on guys , i ? s a big movie , this is a great movie , i ? s Bill Murray . ' Lost In Translation ' ' Ghostbusters ' , i ? s , i ?
zone2	ourtime . Right ... ready ? Listen up . Three , two , one ... 7.17 am , June 30th 1908 . Three to five miles up directly above our heads ... there was an airburst ... here trees ... were incinerated , stripped to the bone as the blast wave , ... moved vertically downwards . Identical patterning was replicated in the 1950's . ... during atmospheric nucleartests . Are you saying the event was nuclear ? No , no , but the effects were caused by similar shockwaves . Further out trees were felled because ... the blast wave was moving closer to the horizontal when it reached them . So what happened ? This is the expert . Some people think it was an asteroid made of rock or metal . Some say it was a comet made of dust and ice . Just a couple of hours later it would have destroyed Moscow or St . Petersburg . Every living being in a 25 mile radiusjust would have been killed instantly . Yeah . In living history this , the Tunguska event , stands out as
zone2	for the human race ... well i ? s a real possibility . This is Gant , yeah . Hey Frank ... I ? s NASA . No we 've been out in the woods for the last three days , we have n't heard of anything , why , what happened ? I need you to contact my boyfriend , I ca n't get through to him on his mobile . He was meant to meet me at Shannon Airport . Well ... maybe the networks are_just down , so ... No , my mobile works , so does hers . We were ten feet above the runway when the wave hit . We could have aquaplaned into Shannon . - Are you okay to report ? - Yeah . Well they evacuated the airport did n't they ? Look I , I 'm sure that he , he got out in time . Really I ... I 'm sorry , excuse me . No , no , I 'm going , I 'm gon na try and get back out there today . We 'll get a camera
zone2	ocean at speeds of over 500 miles per hour . ... slamming into coastal areas and racing inland with little or no warning . The wave heights have been reported as high as 120 feet , ... a surging mass of water engulfing an area over 3,000 square miles . Officials in Dublin have estimated the initial death toll ... at over 10,000 . The President will be issuing a full statement in the next few hours . Our initial data strongly suggests that the Tsunami was caused by a near earth object ... impacting into the Atlantic Ocean ... 300 miles off the Irish Coast . Over 30,000 people are now homeless and hundreds of thousands of people remain missing . NASAwill be launching a full enquiry into this event . We 're sending out a specialist team from ... N.E.O . , our Near Earth Object Programme , to determine the source and composition of the impact object . What we 're talking about here ... is either an asteroid , which is essentially a rock or metal based body , or a comet , which is composed
zone2	n't yet know exactly where it came from . Sir , with all our satellite technology and radar telescopes , how come nobody saw this coming ? Within 24 hours we were on a plane to Ireland desperate to find the answer . We were to be met by Professor Brendan Kelly , eminent astro physicist from Queen 's College . - Hi , Professor Kelly ? - Oh right , Brendan will do . - Josh Hayden . - Hi , Josh Neil Gant . Hayden and Gant eh ? You sound like a couple of outlaws . - Or lawyers . - Yeah same thing in my book . This is Tam Ly our resident Tsunami expert . Sent by the Gods . In fact by the University of Tokyo . You 're not from Japan ? No , no , I 'm originally from Vietnam , I did my MSC in America , Santa Cruz . Brendan 's expertise was in ... the microscopic particles left overfrom the creation of our solar system . You know the thing about dust ... Yeah , dust is so important
zone2	the universe . You mean the accumulation of dust ? I know what I mean . I 'm the King of Dust ! When do you think we 'll be able to get down to the coast ? Ah access is restricted at the minute , we 'll go to Shannon tomorrow , see if we can get authorisation . I 'll put a call in , get NASAto pull some strings for us . Right , make yourself at home . We 've been trying to collate some incoming evidence , seismic data , barometric readings . Lot of stuff coming in from India . You know we 're gon na have to give this N.E.O . A name . Well , is n't that thejob of the Minor Planet Centre ? Oh they 're down in Massachusetts , anyway we need a standby , something a little more media friendly than ... ' un - No I was thinking of ... What ? - Rockall . Rockall . I ? s the sea area the comet hit , i ? s a little Island about 250 miles north
zone2	s a good idea Brendan . Here you go . Hey , where did you get these images ? American Military Reconnaissance , but we 're gon na need a lot more data than this if we 're gon na get a handle on Rockall 's trajectory . Find out where it came from ... and why we missed it . All we had had was an approximate impact site in t what we needed was an accurate trajectory to tell us where it came from . - Anyone for curry ? - No thanks Brendan . Forget fish , curry 's the thing for your brain . Project Rockall ... I ? s all in the turmeric you see . I ? s full of curcumin , which is an anti-oxidant , so now you know . Get the curry down you , ward off that mental decay . You should have some Josh . That was a flight attendant on 419 , the plan that outran the wave , well she 's got the footage on her cell phone ... but she 's heading back to the US
zone2	can go . - Tha ? s ourterritory . - Yeah , yeah . Here we go . Oh we can get a time stamp on that . - And tha ? s good ? - Oh tha ? s very good . Now is there any chance we could get the flight path data ... to find out exactly where you were when you took t Yeah , sure . If we can get a fix on your exact position we can cross-reference that with the light in this ... and then i ? ll help us get a sense of the trajectory of the N.E.O . And then you can find out where it came from right ? Exactly . Have you got wireless connect on this cell phone ? Yeah you do . Great its worked . Marcie , thank you very much , you 've been very helpful . So , you guys are like spacemen ? We 're not trained in aeronautics but yeah we 're part of NASA . Now N.E.O . Why i ? s at the heart of the space industry .
zone2	' The Matrix ' ? You are so cool ! I 'm kidding . Charlie , how are you ? - Brendan ... - Any news of the family ? No , nothing , nothing yet . Come here , let me show you . - Excuse me , we 're from ... - Just one second . ... we 're from NASA , we , we need immediate access to the disaster zone , there 's some permits here for us apparently . Anyone know anything about permits for NASA ? Be here all day . Yes . We need another airlift ASAP but ... the main supply route is blocked , so if you ca n't get a runway slot we 'll have to do the food drop by parachute . Excuse me sir , are you from FEMA ? I ... well yeah , I 'm just helping out with the International Disaster Response ... Neil Gant , with NASA . Adam right ? You care to help out a compatriot ? Adam Gregorski , the FEMA guy , secured us permits within the hour , we
zone2	analyse the debris left by the Tsunami before ... it was disturbed by the clear up operation . To the trained eye this wreckage held vital clues to the origins of the N.E.O . That had so taken us by surprise . We 'll build a map of the debris pattern , we 'll learn more about the wave . And we 'll start to get a handle on Rockall . Three days ago those rocks were at the bottom of the sea . You know , 1,000 years from now people will come here like this was the Irish Stonehenge , and they 'll be thinking " how did they get the rocks up there ? " huh ? Cliff height is about 72 feet so we know ... the wave was at least that high as it hit the coast . Maybe they 'll think of it as a monument to 8/8 . The wave spilled overthe cliff and scattered the debris across a vast area . The scatter pattern and the inclination of once vertical structures would ... tell us the precise strength and direction of the
zone2	! There 's someone here , there 's someone in here ! I 've got her head . We 've got ta get to a hospital . One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten , eleven ... Neil , there 's no pulse . Neil , i ? s too late . There 's an e-mail from that air hostess , she 's managed to get hold of the radar data and the exact flight co-ordinates . We need to get it into the mapping programme . - I 'll do it when we get back . - Huh ? - I 'll do it when we get back . - Fine . Tsunami death toll rises ... Turn it off ! ... authorities struggling to cope with the number of bodies . - Churches and schools are being used - Please . - As temporary mortuaries . - Thank you . I ? s been four days since the Tsunami hit . The roads are full of mud and dirt left behind as the sea water retreated
zone2	walls , timbers and other debris ... that the search for survivors continues . Stay here tonight . Would n't it be betterto head back ? I do n't mind driving , - we can be in Dublin by ... - Josh , we 'll stay here tonight . Go easy on him , his father lived here . I 'm looking for Bryan Kelly . Daddy . We let this thing through you know , we let it through ... Neil ! No-one could have predicted this . Ourjob is to watch objects in space . If i ? s not our responsibility , whose is it ? Oh Neil , get real . There 's a lot less dust than I expected , if it was an asteroid it was no more than 50 metres across . And an asteroid that small would never reach the ocean ? No . And even if it did , it would never have had enough powerto ... generate a Tsunami with such a high amplitude , I mean the wave height measurements were fartoo large for an asteroid of only 50
zone2	it could have been much largerthan 50 metres , two , three hundred and ... even if it exploded on impact there would have been relatively little dust ... Because unlike an asteroid i ? s composed mainly of ice . It would have been moving much fasterthan an asteroid too , you know , between 20 and 35 miles per second . Definitely enough muscle to cause a Tsunami . Yeah . Yeah . Le ? sjust match that with the co-ordinates of ... Marcie 's sighting and the satellite images ... and le ? s see if we get ... - Here she comes . - We get the point of impact . Oh yeah , notjust that ... Now if we trace the trajectory backwards ... we should be able to find out where she came from , look the orbit is practically grazing the sun , tha ? s why we missed her . A sling-shot back to there ... just to the left Betelgeuse off Orion 's shoulder , - Oh gotcha - tha ? s where she came from . From the outset of
zone2	by the impact of a , a near-earth object , a , an N.E.O . We 've discovered that this was a small long period comet , approximately 200 metres in diameter , probably formed in the very early solar system , even before the planets existed , and now , now we know where it came from . Why was n't the comet spotted in time ? Well there are teams of astronomers around the world whose ... sole purpose is finding and tracking N.E.O . ' s ... but sadly this particular one could n't have been predicted by them or anyone else ... Why is that ? Well because the comet approached earth at an acute angle , very small , obscured by the glare of the sun . Like fighter pilots driving out of the sun to ... surprise an enemy , impossible to see until i ? s too late . So another one could sneak up on us at any time ? No , no . No . An event like the Rockall comet happens perhaps , oh , once every few thousand years
zone2	never bear witness to , but sounds a bit odd , but it was a privilege , a tragic one , with ... terrible consequences but a privilege nevertheless . The power of nature , for better orfor worse . The scientific global community will continue to ... monitorthe comet for years to come but ... thanks to the work of Project Rockall the foundation of that research is now in place , and with it hopefully some sense of closure forthe families of the people ... who so tragically lost their lives in this natural disaster . So that was how it started . The biggest N.E.O . Impact since Tunguska and we 'd missed it . How could we have known that 8/8 wasjust the beginning ? The worst was yet to come . - We did ourjob , Neil . - Did we ? Yes . Our remit is to find objects over one kilometre in size . Rockall was 200 metres and we were n't even looking for it . May be we should have been . We do n't have those sort of resources .
zone2	I 'll see you at the gate . - Neil ? Hey . - Hey . Are you heading home ? Yeah , the projec ? s all wrapped up so ... they got you working again already huh ? Yeah , the Dublin route . I ? s kinda quiet but tha ? ll change . - You look beat . - Yeah . - Do you wan na walk with me ? - Yeah . I 'm just curious , what is your star sign ? Oh ... I do n't . Oh okay , well what do we know ? You have a big sense of responsibility , you take everything very personally , and I would say that you are kinda cautious . I would say tha ? s about the stupidest thing I 've ever heard . And I would say that you are a Scorpio . Wow ! I am impressed . So ... how about you ? Pisces . Really ? What are they like ? Oh we 're warm-hearted , idealistic , sensitive ... Just the good traits huh ? Oh God
zone2	that tends to be balanced out by our ideal partners , Cancer or ... Scorpio . This is me , so ... Oh ... maybe I 'll see you around ? Yeah , I hope so . Hey who knows , maybe i ? s in the stars ? Ground Control to Major Tom ! Are you receiving me spaceman ? I 'm sorry I got ta do this , i ? s really important . I 'll see you in the morning . No , take a look . Orion is amazing tonight . Betelgeuse , i ? s as red as a berry . Betelgeuse ? I ? s a star where Rockall came from . Welcome to my world . Since 8 it seemed every astronomer//on the planet was hun all sightings found their way to my inbox . No matter how trivial I had to log them , calculate the trajectories and ... estimate potential impact dates . Expert opinion was that it would not be happen in our lifetime , but i had to be ensure that . I 've got something to show you
zone2	' Science ' has accepted it for publication next month . Oh and if you flip it overtha ? s a list of Universities ... who want us to , to deliver a key note lecture . Josh I have a backlog of a hundred unmapped N.E.O . ' s here ... any one of which could be headed our way so I real do n't see how glad-handing universities makes it to the top of our To Do list . I 've got Kimberly Marshall on hold . Do you want me to put herthrough ? No , no , I 'll take it in my office . Read it ! I ? s your work . Unbelievable . Unbelievable . A new sighting from Australia , an N.E.O . Discovered by two astronomers Gibden and Bell . Our sentry programme calculated a rough trajectory and impact date . The date was chillingly familiar . A second sighting , the same N.E.O . And then a third . Looks like i ? s only gon na be famous from the lectures out here . Seriously the good news is
zone2	doing ... - Hey Josh . - What N.E.O . Does ... Look at the date of approach , August 8th 2009 . What ? We 're getting different observations on the same comet chain , 15 sightings so far , so put it all into SENTRY to get a date closest to approach , and what comes out ? August 8th , same date as the Irish impact . Which means that one year on , earth could be right back in the firing line again . This is comet Rockall 's trajectory and ... this is what we 've got so far on the new sightings potential comet chain . Now what I wan na do is get images from the Lincoln telescope and ... reports from Russia , Australia ... Fine , yeah fine . Run with the precovery . Try and keep it in perspective , this is conjecture , not fact . Hey , hey , hey ... ah ... ah ... I , I , I know we were gon na go to Vegas this weekend , I ... I got ta go to
zone2	, the Catalina Sky Survey , Arizona . Oh ! Arizona ! Wow . Yeah , I 'm really sorry , I just ... I 've really got ta I ? s fine . Lets go . Oh you do n't wan na come , i ? s like an eight hundred mile round trip . Well ... I tell you what , I will drive and you can pay the speeding fines . So what happens at Catalina ? Precovery . I ? s a little technical . I understood the Matrix Trilogy Neil , indulge me . - This is it ? - Yeah . This is where the guardians of the planet watch over us ? Is there a problem ? No , no , no , no . I wasjust expecting something a little , you know , cooler , a little more ' X Men ' . This is it . This is a photographic log of the constellation of Orion . - I ? s divided up into sections . - I get it . The computer stores images of the last few weeks
zone2	the comet chain before today , before it really registered as a moving object . - Precovery ? - Precovery . Right ... The hard thing is telling the comet from the stars . I ? sjust one tiny speck of light amongst ... thousan but we 've got one thing going for us ... stars do n't move , N.E.O . ' s do . If you take pictures of exactly the same part of the sky but weeks apart then flip between them , find a startha ? s moved , it ai n't a star , i ? s an N.E.O . What time is it ? Just to the left of Betelgeuse off the shoulder of Orion , exactly the same place as Rockall came from . Neil ? It was a long period comet probably ten to 12 miles in size originally , the same as Haley 's comet , probably broke up around 1,000 years ago and formed a chain . Now what hit Ireland was a fragment ... that got a little bit ahead probably due to out-gassing , and what we 're
zone2	back around ... in the same orbit and intersecting with us again . Tha ? s a lot of probably 's . Probably . And you 're talking massive error margins . Your mapping 's rudimentary and there simply is n't enough data yet . Well I 'm , I 'm , I 'm getting it , but Josh we 're looking at a Torino scale 6 here . Oh , but you 're using a scale tha ? s only been used for asteroids and relating it to comets . They 're completely different animals , you know that . Comets are way more unpredictable , outgassing for a start . You ca n't talk about Torino 6 . We can not afford to get this wrong Josh , you know what happened last time . Josh , I want you to take this threat seriously , forward my report to Lampanelli and get NASA behind us on this ... Neil , Neil you keep doing this to me . What report ? You 've got some half-assed daubings on my office wall , you 're a mess man
zone2	a false alarm , we will monitorthe situation no , yes , yes we will monitor it but what we will not do ... is go off half-cocked and ... look like a bunch of amateurs . Is that all you care about these days Josh ? How you look . You need to get some sleep , and take a shower while you 're at it . In fact ... take the rest of the day off . I ? s not a suggestion . An event like the Rockall comet happens perhaps , oh , once every few thousand years . The power of nature , for better orfor worse . 65 million years ago , an asteroid or comet ... impacted the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico , creating 100 mile wide crater . The KT Extinction Event . I ? s estimated the impact of the force ... was equivalent to six million Hiroshima bombs . It created a vast dust cloud which blocked the light of the sun and prevented photosynthesis for many years . The KT Extinction Event was the death knell forthe majority of
zone2	Neil Gant it could all happen again . Breaking newsjust in from the United States , a NASA scientist has reported that ... comet Rockall , which caused such devastation in Western Ireland , may have been part of a chain of comets ... which could collide with planet earth in eight months time . Switch the telly on . Professor Gant has named the comet chain Gibden-Bell ... afterthe two astronomers who first discovered it ... Reports of another possible comet impact have sparked fear in the worl ? s media . Stocks crashed in the blackest day for Wall Street in living memory ... Interest rates ... soared and Banks closed their doors ... as trading ceased across the globe . You'vejust wiped ten billion dollars off the DowJones Index , and now the panic 's rippling around the rest of the world . You 've embarrassed N.E.O . It looks as if we were covering it up . Were n't we ? Lampinelli called . NASAwants us both in Washington . General Harris has demanded a debrief . Who ? The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
zone2	, that General Harris . - Hi Frank . - Morning Josh . The General 's ready for you both . I hope you 've said your Hail Marys . I 'm not interested in the politics of who said what , when or why right now , I just want facts . Is earth in danger of being hit by another comet ? There is a potential threat , yes sir . Our calculations suggest a one percent chance ... of a collision somewhere on the earth 's surface . One percent ? You put the fear on everyone on this planet for one percent ? If there was a one percent chance there was a rattlesnake in your back yard , would you let your kids go out and play hide and seek ? We 're currently working on predicting the come ? s chain 's ellipse , its trajectory , but tha ? s not something we can nail down in a matter of weeks . What are you saying ? The further away the comet chain , the less accurate our predictions . We need to
zone2	handle on the comet chain 's size and its structure . Okay , I 'll back it . Wha ? s the situation with the Japanese and European space agencies ? We 're liaising with them now . Good , and I want a report on our response options to this thing . We 've got ta be ready . I 'm gon na need to put a team together sir . Whatever you need . Looks like you gentlemen have your work cut out . Today NASA announced the first tracking of a cosmic probe to ... investigate Gibden-Bell , the comet chain scientists ... fear could be on a direct collision path with earth . - Hey welcome . - How are ya ? Yeah , good . Back at N.E.O . We set about refining our calculations for Gibden-Bell 's trajectory . As the comet got nearer our calculations improved . It was not good news . Each time the potential comet path narrowed ... it seemed to be honing in on planet earth . Spotlight Voyager Seven , NASA report progress on the preparation of the
zone2	t the probe could be_just days from launch . What we 're trying to create here is a spread of a Tsunami envelope . If a fragment of Gibden-Bell does hit there 's a high probability , it will impact in one of our major oceans . If i ? s a land impact then the dust composition will be critical . For dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return . Are these the samples from the Stardust mission ? I 'm just trying to see if the fragments we record from Rockall can give us an idea ... - as to the composition , go on take a look . - Oh great , thanks . If a high percentage of those particles contain sulphur ... we could be heading for another Ice Age . So deadly , yet so pretty . Oh gosh they 're beautiful . - How are things with Josh ? - Yeah ... If there is an impact this is the bad boy we need to worry about . Roughly a mile in diameter he 's about the size of Central
zone2	second . If any fragment is gon na impact , it will be this one , the largest of the fragments Gibden-Bell A . Who 's gon na tell the General ? As the threat of comet impact increases ... NASA announces that the launch of probe Voyager Seven is imminent . Mission focus will be the largest comet Gibden-Bell A . Anything Neil ? I 've been working on the Whipple shoot issue forthe probe , the launch team is saying there 's not enough space on the launch vehicle ... but I think i ? s essential if we 're gon na protect the probe from comet debris . Wha ? s up with you ? Still working on those radar images from Arecibo . They 'll be nothing like the probe can give us but ... worth having a back-up . Arecibo , the most powerful radio telescope on earth . Wishful thinking on Josh 's part , the comet chain was still too distant for us to see anything useful . We desperately needed the probe . - D minus ten - Guys , i ?
zone2	the probe for launch . Now their efforts are complete , we have lift-off . Voyager Seven ascends towards the stars , its mission to conduct a thorough analysis of the comet Gibden-Bell . As the likelihood of an impact continues to rise , this essential information will confirmed or denied the possibilies to collision with earth With it go the hopes and fears of all mankind . God speed Voyager Seven . If a comet impacts in the ocean , it will create a Tsunami 20 times the size of the one that hit Ireland , and if it hits the Pacific ... well , we can say goodbye to the whole of the West Coast . The countries of Central America will be devastate as will Japan ... and i ? s no betterforthe Atlantic . We 'd lose every coastal county in New England , Virginia , the Carolinas , Georgia and Florida . The waves produced would annihilate Ireland and the British Isles and cause ... Ireland again eh ? ... and cause chaos in mainland Europe , the Caribbean , North West Africa ... we
zone2	millions . What if we do n't let it hit ? What if we try and deflect it ? Well your man at Imperial College thinks it can be done but ... they 're still finessing the figures on the mass to thrust ratios . No I 'm not talking about kinetic impact . Given the time frame , a stand-off nuclear explosions are the only viable option . This is a possible solution that ... we could present to General Harris next week . Josh the ... the implications of using thermo nuclear weapons ... I know , but it is an approach tha ? s actually got a chance of working . Give it a read . Le ? s at least try going with this . Well Josh has got a possible solution , but it could make things a whole lot worse . Ca n't you two broker a ceasefire or something ? You know , forthe sake of mankind ? Well the thing is Josh might be right . Whoa , whoa , whoa , you said that he was wrong . Yeah well there
zone2	wha ? s driving me nuts . Nobody 's ever been in a situation like this before , i ? s all on us and if we screw up ... we could wind upjust like wiping out the whole planet . Marcie ? You 'd betterfix this Neil . Gentlemen . Professor . The comet chain Gibden-Bell . Now this is the fella which most concerns us . A one mile size fragment we 're calling Gibden-Bell A . Ourforecasts now suggest a 60 percent chance of collision . Oh i ? s coming gentlemen and in four months time . Now if you look at the ellipse pattern , you 'll see that America 's very much in the line of fire , either via a giant Tsunami if the impact occurs in ... either ocean orthrough a direct land strike , which would devastate thousands of square miles . Now here 's how we persuade it to go away . Stand off nuclear diversion . A series of nuclear devices will be launched to the comet , programmed to detonate alongside it , far enough away to avoid
zone2	of one side of the comet causing ... that side to outgas altering its trajectory , thrusting it away from the earth . What model basis did you use ? The Icarus Project developed at M.I.T . In 1967 . That was a , a hypothetical collision with earth by the asteroid 1566 Icarus . But Icarus assumed that they had 15 months for the deflection , you 're saying we only have four ? NASA has been preparing a delivery system since the threat was first registered . The plan will require international co-operation , besides American launch bases , we 'd look to use sites in Europe and China . We 've already received a pledge from the Russians . Well I presume our French Gowandan base would be suitable , however gentlemen I can not stress enough the time factor here . The schedule is achievable if we move quickly . Oh clearly , clearly time is of the essence ... We can not rush into a nuclear deflection strategy . Right now we have no idea of the stability of the comet , tha ? s
zone2	. If Gibden-Bell A is unstable and we try to deflect it , it could break up and the cometesimals released would be like multiple re-entry warheads , they would smash into our atmosphere at 160,000 miles an hour . Tha ? s not what the Deep Impact mission found . Comet 9P-Tempel was , well a lot tougherthan we thought . Yeah well what about Shoemaker-Levy 9 ? Jupiter 's gravity ... tore it to pieces , it turns out that its structure was weakerthan fresh powder snow . The point is that each one of these N.E.O . ' s is structurally unique , tha ? s a fact . Sorry gentlemen , my colleague Neil Gant , he thinks we have time . I do n't . Until we get the results of that probe we can only guess as to the come ? s composition , but one thing is for sure , deflecting a comet is an entirely different proposition than deflecting an asteroid . Icarus was designed to deflect an asteroid , which is made of metal or rock not ... a come ?
zone2	wan na throw nukes at that ? That is like playing baseball with a water melon ! Neil thank you , tha ? s enough ! Sit down . No , no , no , no . I wan na hearthis . Alright . If this is the blast radius of the comet fragment that ... caused the Tunguska event in Siberia in 1908 ... then this would be Washington DC ... today . If that comet breaks up we 're gon na create thousands of projectiles of this kind of powertha could impact anywhere on this planet , London , New York , Paris , Rome ... the destruction globally of multiple impacts would be ... ten times greaterthan that of a single impact to America and ... of course there 's no way to predict the impact zone , so no warning , no evacuation , no planning is possible . Just death and destruction on an unimaginable scale , If you 're against deflecting the comet , what alternative strategy are you proposing ? America has to take the hit . Are you suggesting we sit back
zone2	four months preparing in every detail an evacuation strategy . Ten days before impact we will know exactly where i ? s going to hit . We spend those ten days executing the plan . If i ? s gon na hit in the sea then we evacuate the coast , if i ? s gon na hit land then ... we evacuate half the country . We could n't clear New Orleans in one week for Katrina , and you wan na play musical chairs with 100 million people ? It would take all the help of all of our allies and , probably most of our enemies too , but this is our best option . I ? s impossible . Even if we could evacuate , what about everything in the impact zone ? Cities , farms , factories . It would be economic suicide . America would be blasted back to the Stone Age . Allowing the comet to hit could create a cloud of dust and ... sulphur aerosols that would block out the rays of the sun . Food production then becomes impossible .
zone2	more through starvation . It could be an Ice Age all over again . Brendan Kelly , Queen 's University . I 'd like to add something . An impact winter is not a certainty . It depends on how much sulphurthere is in the comet , how much sulphurthere is in the impact zone . The come ? s precise mass and speed , the truth , the truth is ... we wo n't know ... until i ? s too late . Thank you , and if we do n't know then how can we commit to such an extreme course of action ... Gentlemen , gentlemen , gentlemen ... ... tha ? ll be all for now . - Frank ... - Sir ? ... could you stay back a moment ? - Absolutely . You knew that he would go forthe nuclear deflection ... because he gets to use all his little toys ... and he gets to play the big military hero and that is why you suggested it . - But if it works , it works . - What if it does n't
zone2	to disagree . Not at this stage we 're not , and not after I 'd laid out very clearly what that strategy would be . ... listen up . General Harris hasjust green lit the nuclear option . But , but , but he 's also considering other plans . The final decision will hinge on the outcome of the probe , is that understood ? Yes sir . In the meantime , since you two are unable to agree on a single thing , I suggest you stay out of each other 's way ... and find out exactly where GBA is gon na hit ... to the nearest millimetre . Adam Gregorski , sir . Post New Orleans , several people whose opinions I 'm supposed to respect have told me ... you 're the best man FEMA has . What I 'm about to say to you is highly classified . I 'm a professional . General , I assume tha ? s why you called me in . I need FEMAto work up an emergency mass evacuation strategy . It needs to exceed the remit
zone2	the DCPAwas tasked with ... creating a Crisis Relocation Plan ... Designed to evacuate citizens from urban centres in the event of a nuclear attack . ... Right , and if we continue to fund the programm update it with regular drills the catastrophes we faced during ... hurricanes Rita and Katrina could have been mitigated . The sad fact is we did n't and the crisis we 're facing now , makes Katrina look like a walk in the park . You want me to resurrect CRP ? I need you to look at the research it was based on and ... adapt it for something different and far greater in scope . Tha ? s our starting point . Urban or rural evacuations ? Both . Multiple locations . Cities , towns , it could be north , south , east or west , it might be a concentrated geographic area , it could well be scattered over many states . Gregorski , I want you to put together a plan to move 100 million people . Rumours from Los Alamos , New Mexico suggest that ... recorded
zone2	Houston leaks suggest that ... engineers are secretary adapting rockets to deliver warheads to deflect Gibden-Bell A . Injust two days , Voyager Seven will start beaming back information ... on the precise trajectory of the comet chain , informations NASA scientists insist will be ... critical to the success of any future mission . There 's a story that Eisenhower instructed that ... for every five miles of highway they built , it was mandatory that at least one mile be absolutely straight . Well , tha ? s a myth , but I did some digging around ... and what is true is that Congress considered using a flight strip programme in their Federal Aid Highway Act of 1944 , and that got me thinking . Besides utilising all the military and commercial air bases on the West Coast , why should we not also use ourfreeways and ... use them as improvised landing strips ? Now this here is a map of the Utah desert . Interstate 80 ... mile after mile of straight road . Can you work this up state by state ? We 're
zone2	feasible ... and they will require several levels of adaptation , bulldozing the central reservations , removing power lines and signs . Reinforcing the ground to take the weight of small aircraft , but if we have to move people fast we can move them , and en masse . Our roads become our runways . Tha ? s the idea . Injust 12 hours , Voyager Seven will start its analysis of comet Gibden-Bell . Reports of military activity on several continents appears to confirm that ... a nuclear deflection strategy is moving into an advanced stage . Evacuation capacity index . Our 37 largest urban areas . How is the index calculated ? Traffic flow , highway capacity , accessibility to cars . The report also shows information on the transit dependent . How bad is that ? Those 20 cities will be harderto evacuate than ... New Orleans was after Katrina . Are you saying i ? s impossible ? Nothing 's impossible . We 'll have international help , offers are flooding in . Le ? s get it ready . The world holds its collective
zone2	threat that mankind has faced is revealed forthe very first time . These simple somewhat hypnotic pictures live from the probe Voyager Seven show ... the comet chain in all its terrible beauty . Only now will we learn the true nature of the threat that we all face . Entire nations have come to a standstill . Factories , offices , schools , all closed ... as people gaze in awe at the simple images that we see here . The comet chain , Gibden-Bell as it hurtles towards the earth . Pasadena ... lost transmission . Please confirm . Land impact confirmed , civil unrest breaks out . Curfew imposed from dusk til dawn , ... as America wakes up to the news . Unless scientists can stop it , comet Gibden-Bell will hit North America . The probe was destroyed before it had a chance to feed back any data , the official announcement will be made tomorrow , but I wanted you all to hear it first hand . The decision has been made to go ahead with the nuclear deflection strategy ... scheduled for six
zone2	n't sell your solution to the President , and he ca n't sell it to the American people . My responsibility is to protect the United States of America . And who 's gon na protect the rest of the world when the comet splits up into a thousand pieces ? If it breaks up , and ai n't we all part of the same planet ? What is wrong with you people ? It is so clearly betterto go into the terrible situation with a known risk than ... to take an alternative with an ambiguous outcome ... where the hazards are much worse for Americans and the whole world and General with all due respect if you were n't so worried about your career ... - then you could sell this to the President ... - Neil . Get him outta here . ... you could sell it to the President . - Someone get him outta here . - You could sell it to the President ... - Get him outta here ... Forget it Brendan , just forget it . This report here pertains to gold
zone2	... here , for instance here sir , we have an example of plans to dismantle relocate the Statue of Liberty . My recommendation is that we allocate the bulk of our resources into saving our people . Of course . Well we 've also made provisions for animal preservation and transportation , cattle , sheep and swine movements will have to be assessed , that is here sir ... The President has given his go-ahead for the nuclear option . I understand . But if that should fail , God hope it does n't , then this plan will be invaluable . This is good work . Professor Gant , is n't it ? We met in Ireland briefly at Shannon Airport , your , yourfellow compatriot ? Yeah right . What are you doing in the road there 's a curfew on , they 'll pick you up . Get in . This is brilliant . Thank you , thanks . It could really do this huh ? They could really pull this off . Are you sure the deflection plan will backfire ? No . It could
zone2	greater probability that it wo n't , based on all the information that we have and ... especially everything that we do n't have . I am 100 percent convinced that the deflection strategy is the wrong way to go . The outcome of this is still in your hands Neil . You'vejust got ta persuade General Harris to go against every military bone in his body . Oh is that all ? Yes tha ? s all . Listen , you'vejust got ta come up with something , you 've got ta give him something , I do n't know what , some intel , pictures , reports , just somethin Arecibo . Wha ? s that ? Oh Neil , I 'm such an idiot . Arecibo i ? s an observatory in Puerto Rico , Josh was trying to get images up before , there 's still a chance they might have some radar images , can you drive me somewhere please ? World leaders meet to discuss the impending comet threat . The President is expected to make an official statement at six pm tomorrow ,
zone2	option . Around the world people of all faiths gather in prayer and ... contemplation as the earth awaits its destiny . Oh the return of the native ! Where have you been , we 've been worried . Have you seen Josh ? Yeah he 's playing pool , i ? s not a pretty sight . We 're gon na convince General Harris to change his mind . Well this might come in handy , sulphur results from Rockall , the levels are practically zero . If the comet hits us there 's no chance for nuclear winter , the earth would survive . Fantastic Brendan , we 've got something pretty great here too . Hey ... I wan na apologise to you , to all of you , my behaviour was totally unacceptable , I 'm sorry I never intended to make anybody look bad . You made us all look bad . - Did you see Brendan 's report ? - I did . - What do you think ? - I ? s not enough on its own . Oh Josh please , please
zone2	to be able to absorb the kind of energy tha ? s gon na be required to make a deflection work . I think you know that Josh ... because if we fire those missiles up there i ? sjust gon na explode ... and the fall out ... the fall outs gon na kill all of us . Do you remember Adam Gregorski , the FEMA guy who fixed us up in Ireland ? General Harris asked for him to develop an evacuation strategy . The Joint Chiefs were seriously considering it actually . I 've seen the plan , Adam thinks that he can pull it off , I do too . So ... if we let the comet hit yeah i ? s gon na be a major catastrophe , but we can manage it , we can plan for it , we can save lives . If it breaks up ... I ? s not going to break up . Think about what we saw in Ireland . The people , the places . That was one Tsunami . We risk creating multiples with this strategy
zone2	I 've got everything I need right here but unfortunately I ca n't do it without you , so ... the Arecibo Conservatory came through , you were right about having a back-up . Look at it man , look at it , i ? s smooth which suggeststhat i ? s fragile . Yes , well smooth does imply i ? s more likely to break apart . Right . - But hardly definitive . - Oh come on Josh ! I ? s Occam 's razor , Josh . All things being equal , the simplest solution is the right one , and there 's nothing much more simple than this . We ca n't fight nature . We 've got ta live with it . General , this report is based on the latest intelligence we have . It clearly backs up our worst case scenarios for the nuclear deflection plan . Our worse case scenarios ? You convinced me to go with that plan , you championed it , you 're its chief architect . This is true but there 's new evidence now . The
zone2	must be allowed to land unimpeded . Why have you changed your mind ? This latest intelligence report and ... the input and ... intuition of one of the finest scientific minds in the world . General , NASA is now 100 percent behind the evacuation option . The radar images from the Arecibo observatory have now been ... backed up by new images from the Goldstone solar system radar in California . Now , we believe that togetherthey present sufficient evidence to suggest that ... nuclear deflection runs too great a risk of fracturing the comet . You 'd see America exposed ? Our infrastructure decimated ? Our way of life immeasurably altered ? The alternative is a world in a kind of chaos that it will not survive . America will survive sir , I believe that . These men are my specialists . General , I trust them absolutely . Sir , is it true you were awarded the Medal of Honour in Vietnam ? Yes . Have you heard the story of one of yourfellow Medal winners , Marine Private Jack Lee Lucas ? The name
zone2	17 . Private Lucas was with three other men crawling through a ravine ... when the Japanese launched a hand grenade attack . He threw himself on two of the grenades to save his companions , the blast blew him into the air , ripped chunks out of his chest , but he survived . Lucas did n't ask to be a hero , he took the shrapnel from those grenades because ... it was the only thing to do . America needs to step up and take that hit because ... because it can . Tha ? s a very nice story Professor , but like you . I preferto make my decisions based on the evidence before me . Gentlemen . Leave me to think this through . Tonight the North East of America is on the move . Instead of the widely expected strategy of nuclear deflection , the President unveiled a comprehensive Federal Evacuation Plan , now 15 US and two Canadian States are being relocated . The authorities have_just four weeks to safely evacuate 100 million people . Tonight the mass exodus of Washington starts
zone2	and cities all across the Eastern States , as people living east of the line of separation flee their homes in their millions . International support has been described as " overwhelming " . Ships , aircraft and essential supplies are being ... directed to the evacuation zone from around the world . Navies from Russia , India , Great Britain and France are ... assisting with the evacuation of the eastern sea port . The plan has been hailed as comprehensive in its application , ... encompassing all aspects of historical and contemporary existence . On Liberty Island the rescue programme is underway for New York 's most famous cultural landmark . Where should we draw the line ? From muzeums to zoos , tha ? s the question facing officials as the hours tick by . Sir , they 're suggesting that we re-commission the bunkerfacility ... in the Greenbriar Hotel in West Virginia . Forget about Greenbriar , strike it off the list . Even though they survive the impact ... they 'll be crawling into a burning desert , i ? s no good . Elephant
zone2	save ? Er ... you know , aside from human beings , the elephant is the only other land animal that actually sheds tears . Tha ? s very touching Leon but i ? s not true . Many animals produce tears to lubricate the eye , it does not imply emotion . But apart from us the elephants are the only one's that seem to grieve ... when they lose a family member , when an elephant walks past the spot where they lost a loved one ... theyjust stop still . They mourn their dead . Across the impact zone ... airports , military and private airfields are working around the clock to maximise the evacuation . In the rest of the world flights have ground ... to a halt as national airlines donate theirfle Military aircraft and cargo carriers are being adapted to ferry evacuees at unprecedented rates . More planes are being put in the air in one hour than are normally undertaken in an entire day . I 've been told that even crop sprayers are being utilised to help airlift people out ... of
zone2	large international airports such Dulles that ... the true scale of the evacuation can be seen . Freeways , highways , just about anywhere an aircraft can land has been requisitioned by FEMAto accelerate the exodus . Skies above major Southern State cities are filled with planes . Volunteer air crews , emergency and military personnel will be those at the front line , risking themselves to the very end to ensure that as many people as possible get out alive . - Josh ! Any sign of Marcie 's transport ? - Not yet . I do n't want you to do this , I want you to be so efficient , just get on that flight and never look back . Nobody forced me , I volunteered remember ? Well do n't take too many trips and , I mean do n't leave it too long to get yourflight out of there okay ? I ? s here ! This is it . I ? s ... not for Marcie , i ? s for us . Sorry . Marcie , I ... I know . You 've
zone2	too . Be safe . I will . Five days before comet impact and civil unrest spreads throughout the impact zone . Despite the massive numbers successfully transported to safety , panic is spreading amongst those for whom time is running out . Josh ! Josh we got it , we 've got the target , i ? s Pennsylvania , i ? s Pennsylvania . - You sure ? - Yeah , i ? s Pennsylvania . Okay . Yeah , can I speak to General Harris please ? Urgently . Hi , i ? s Josh Hayden here , we 've got the target , i ? s Pennsylvania . The State of Pennsylvania has been identified , ... as the likely epicentre of the comet impact . Prioritised now for evacuation resources are being swiftly ... directed towards the State and the surrounding areas . Exact impact possibilities now ... include the Pennsylvanian cities of Harrisburgh , Pittsburgh , Philadelphia , Johnstown , or Altoona . I wan na thank you for all the hard work your people put in . We 're not gon na have
zone2	at five percent of the population of the Eastern States being left behind . We can only do wha ? s in our powerto do , and you 've done what you can Adam . Well not yet , I 'm co-ordinating the final stages for Virginia from Dulles airport . Good luck . When do you leave sir ? I 'll be turning out the lights . Last man standing sir ? The Federal Authorities today claimed a 90 percent rate of successful evacuation of the impact States Cities across North East America stand empty afterthe mass re-location of some 90 million people . With less than 48 hours to go those remaining in the impact zone are urged to ... make their way to the congregation points at ports and airfields to ensure their safe evacuation . We have 15 minutes to turn this aircraft around . Quickly as you can please . Fill in from the back ... and sit down as soon as you 're inside . Wait , do n't close the door . Do n't close that . I , I was with my
zone2	he 's gone . Well if he 's not on this flight sir he 'll be ... I have to find him , I 'm getting off . Look this is your last ticket out of here , you miss this you wo n't get out alive , now get back to your seat ... now ... sir . Ladies and gentlemen , for everybody left standing , there are straps and rails provided , please hold on to them with both hands very tightly . I can get three more planes back in the sky in an hour , but we 've lost half ourfuelling crew , I need more men . You carry on loading , I 'll worry about the crew , you 're doing a goodjob , keep it going . Sir ... you may need this . I ? s starting to spiral . Guys ... i ? s Pittsburgh . So Pittsburgh will take the full force of Gibden-Bell A . In the first few seconds after impact a ... 25 mile wide fireball will vaporise everything in its path . The shock wave
zone2	shattered buildings and bones in its wake . As far as Chicago , Washington , Toronto and New York , the shock wave will hit these cities at 600 miles per hour and ... will be followed by a force nine earthquake . God help anyone left behind . I wan na thank you for your bravery and patience . Now we 're looking at the last few calls , sections one and two will leave on the first transport , likewise Frank there 's nothing more for your people to do here , you 're all on the next chopper . If you say so sir . Le ? s go team . I 'd like to stay please . This is the best place to keep tabs on things and ... I just wan na make sure that my calculations are absolutely correct .

If things go wrong here we 're gon na need scientists on the West Coast and ... you 're so much smarterthan us . Hey . One day to impact and with time running out , special rescue teams are targeting those unable to get to designated assembly points . All able-bodied people are urged to get to an evacuation centre as soon as possible . We 're in the final stages of the evacuation here at Dulles , and the last flights are now leaving . With three hours left to go before impact , ... it is finally time to say goodbye to our Nation 's Capital . I ? s weird but I feel ... kinda relieved now , you know . You 're relieved ? Finally you 're relieved ! Morning death , we 've been expecting you . What is that ? Is that , is that some

Adam Gregorski 's at Dulles airport , civilian evac . Change of plan , we 're going by road . Authorities have advised that there will be no more flights leaving forthe impact zone .

zone2	! - Did you take those ? - Yes . That ... Video of those kids in the village , did you do that ? Do you think it 's possible it could be him ? I honestly do n't know . When I was in Rwanda , a colleague and I had to clear a mass grave . There was this woman there , she was screaming and yelling and pointing . We tried to get her to go away , but she would n't budge . We pulled body after body out of there . Mothers , fathers , children . Then finally , at the bottom of the hole , under this heap of dead meat , there was a child , baby boy . He was in a bad way but he was alive . Her son . So do you think it 's possible that Josh could have been traded ? People up in the islands are poor . When things get really rough , they make do with the only capital they have . When someone dies a bad death , the spirit becomes
zone2	what to do . The spirit becomes angry , it becomes vinyan . What do the fire lamps do ? Light is to help guide the vinyan home , to the house of the dead so vinyan can rest . Each light is for one spirit . There 's so many . You can light one . Joshua 's not dead . Not for Joshua . For me . Light one for me . - I 'd better go . - Really ? - I left Jeanne alone . I 'd better go . - You did , did n't you ? Jeanne ? Hey , excuse me . Have you seen a white woman ? Hey , seen a white woman ? Okay . Good , now no problem for you . This is where the Salone and Moken sea gypsies live . Very close to where we think your son is . We 'll go there first . The boy is in the village . You have to pay before you go there . Pay ? No . We 've already paid . We 've paid Mr .
zone2	- For fuck 's sake ! - All right . Paul , Paul , Paul . Pay him , please . Twenty thousand baht . White boy , good boy . We hope so , yeah . Twenty thousand ? Follow that man . White boy .

Yeah , you could say that . Not fucking good . No . You did n't like him ? You fucking lied to me ! You paid for him , why did n't you take him ? That ? I paid for that thing in there ? - He is a child . - He 's not my child . - What did he say ? - He said , what 's the difference ? There are villages further down the coast . I have reports of more

Look . That tape , I watched it . I ca n't really see anything that suggests that it could be Josh . I 'm sorry . To me it looks like it could be any kid . It could even be a little fucking monster like they just tried to sell us . He 's not a monster , Paul . They 're stealing from us . They saw us coming and they are taking us for a ride , it 's as simple as that . We agreed , Paul . You said that even if there was the slightest chance that Josh was alive , we would go and we would find him . I think we have to face facts . And I do n't think there is the slightest chance that Josh is alive , darling . The wave took

Tell him anything . You 're making the right choice . No problem . Wait there . - What ? Where you going ? - Wait there . Jeanne ! Jeanne . Jeanne . The money is gone . The fucking money 's gone . No . I gave him the money . What do you mean you gave him the money ? - I gave it to Gao . - Why ? Why did you that ? But do n't worry . It 's just because he 's going to search for three more days . No , darling , we
zone2	him the money ? Do n't worry , it 's okay . We do n't know who these people are ! We 're in the middle of fucking nowhere ! You ca n't just give him the fucking money ! I want my money back . It 's mine now . Give me my fucking money . Sonchai . We 'll spend the night here . There 's shelter . We 're lost , are n't we ? We 're lost , are n't we ? Do you play poker ? You knew there were no white children here . You knew what those sea gypsies were doing . You fixed it , you fixed all of it . Have some drink . You think we were just going to buy some fucking child ? Any child ? Mr . Bellmer , I did what you asked me to do . Your wife thinks your son is in one of these villages . So I took you to a place where they said there was a white child . Yeah , but that was n't my son ! I lost
zone2	do you know what happened to Sonchai ? Four kids and his wife , all dead in his house . I did n't know that . Mr . Bellmer , I can find your child , I can not cure your pain .

zone2	5210230 [Birds_chirping] [Metal_creaks] [Door_closes] I thought it came at quarter past . They said quarter past . Well , they were wrong . Are you Mr . Boggis ? Ah . You 're master Tolly . I remember you as smaller . I was smaller . I 've grown . Yes , yeah , I suppose you would have . Mrs . Oldknow would have met you , But the R.A.F . decided to move out . They only told her this morning . [Door_opens] Your grandmother 's looking forward to seeing you . Is she ? Are n't you gon na wear your coat ? All right . [Birds_chirping] We 've heard about Mr . David . He 's not dead . Nobody says he 's dead , not even the telegram . He 's just missing inaction . That 's all . Ah . missing . That 's it . that 's it . [Engine_turns_over] How 's your mother ? All right , but busy . She 's trying to find out where he is . She 's had to go to London . Yeah , I expect she has . I expect we 'll have some news
zone2	taken prisoner , Someone 's got to know something . Mm . [Birds_chirping] [Indistinct_conversations] Man : Yes , I think they have . Um , would you double-check ... Uh , has someone checked the music room ? Hello , Tolly . Hello . Do I still call you " granny " ? Well , what else did you have in mind ? I do n't know . " Mrs . Oldknow " ? No , I think we 'd better stick with " granny . " I 'm sorry I could n't meet you . I just did n't dare Leave them to it . Are you sad they 're going ? No . We old knows like to be left to our own devices . I think that 's just about it . I 've told them to put everything back and under dustsheets , So I expect it 's all wrong . [Chuckles] Ah . we 'll sort it out . I hope we have n't been too awful . Well , you did n't pull the place down , So you did better than some .
zone2	let us . Goodbye . Does this mean all the soldiers will be home soon ? Well , there 's an awful lot of cleaning up to do . But most of them should be here before too long . Everything ready to go , sir . Righto . thank you . Bye , again . You remember Mrs . Tweedie ? How do you do ? Oh , course he don't . why should he ? He were n't much more than a scrap when he was last here . [Dog_whimpers] And this is bismarck . He remembers you . Now you come along with me , and we 'll get you settled in . Here we are . Lovely . [Drawers_opening_and_closing] How long have you worked here ? Oh , too man-years to think about . Do you like it ? Yes , I do . Though , it 's a funny old house , no doubt about that . But it 's our funny old house . That 's what my dad used to say . He used to talk about this place all the time .
zone2	[Door_opens] You do n't have to worry . I know he 's alive . I think I 'll still worry a bit , If it 's all right with you . Wo n't you sit-down ? Who are all these people ? They 're your family . But they 're dead , are n't they ? I thought family meant people who were living . I daresay the distinction is more important in manchester ... than further south . Have you ever been to manchester ? Not that I recall . So , how do you know so much about it ? Is your mother well ? Has she found a place in London to stay ? I know you do n't like her . you do n't have to pretend . I did n't think I was pretending . [Door_opens] Here we are . [Bismarck_whimpers] There 's bread for toast . Toasting fork 's there . Well , give me a shout If you need anything else . Granny : thank you , Mrs . Tweedie . [Door_closes] It 's not true I do n't like her . I

Well , sometimes when you 're angry , You can overstate your case . He should n't have shown that to you . He did n't . I found it . Then he should n't have kept it . [Exhales_sharply] I was worried she would n't understand Green Knowe . She 'd come from something very different . Anyway , It 's immaterial now . Why ? I do n't think I shall be here for much longer . Why ? what 's happened ? Nothing . The world 's changing . That 's all . [Exhales_sharply] I do n't think I 'll have enough money to stay . You ca n't sell it . I may have to . But it 's never been sold . Mnh , it 's never been sold till now . We 've come close a few times . She brought
zone2	... like you ? Hardly . That 's Maria Van Raymer . She was Dutch , grew up in India . She married Captain Oldknow In calcutta , Then he brought her home . Green knowe must have seemed very dull ... after such exotic beginnings . Would you do your own sugar ? What 's this bit ? It looks different . That was Maria 's new wing . It was built so she could entertain . Is it because dad 's missing ... why you 're going to leave ? No , it is n't . You must n't think that . If there was anyway I could avoid it , I promise you , I would . He always said this house was a part of you . It 's a part of all of us . It 's a part of your father , part of you , too . You do n't know the place yet , and you do n't know me . So , I suppose it 's hard for you to understand . If you think that , then you do n't
zone2	. Aw . [Door_creaking] [Door_creaks] [Door_creaks] [Girl_crying] Hello ? [Door_opens] , creaks Tolly : they look like Jewelry boxes . So they were ... for Maria Oldknow 's jewels . They must have been put up there before the fire . What fire ? When the new wing burned down . Granny says she almost lost Green Knowe , But why , If she was so rich ? She did n't have money . Her father was a diamond merchant , And her fortune was all In precious stones . She could have sold them . she could have , But by the time she needed to , they 'd been stolen . Do you think she cried when she lost the jewels ? Why ? Do you ? I 'm sure she did . would n't you ? I 'm afraid she took it out on the Captain ... for quite a while afterwards . Did they have children ? They did . They had a son called Sefton ... Ah ... and a daughter called Susan . And you descend from Sefton . What a funny name .
zone2	much of a position to talk . Was Sefton nice ? No . He was selfish and spoiled . The door in the dining room ... with the brick wall behind it ... Was that the way through to Maria 's wing ? It was . [Chuckling] oh , look . You might like this . It was your father 's . I made the pajamas when David had whooping cough ... so they could both have whooping cough together . I 'm too old for it , really . Yes , I know . I just thought it might interest you ... to know it was his . Was Susan spoiled and selfish Like her brother ? No , not at all . No , it would be hard to spoil her . Why ? Enough . Good night . [Door_creaks] , closes He 's a real manchester lad . I offered to send him to a proper school . I was happy to pay for his whole education , But of course she would n't hear of it . Why not ? She did n't want him taught
zone2	'd think she 'd put him first . Obviously his father agreed with her . Only because he was hypnotized . Well , I do n't think It 's done him any harm . He seems as bright as a button to me . She 's a controller . that 's all . I 'm not attacking her . I 'm just stating a fact . That 's why she 's kept him away . He 's only here now ... Because she could n't think how else to manage things . It was exactly the same with David , right from the start ... She could never share him . Could you ? [Rattling] [Gasps] Sefton , is that you ? What where you thinking of , wandering off like that ? Supposing you 'd have fallen down the stairs And broken your neck ? What would you say then ? Very little , I should think . Never mind your cheek . Come back to your own room now . But , Perkins , I was only talking to ... [Breathing_heavily] Is it Sefton ? There 's nobody
zone2	are you doing downstairs ? Well , I hope It 's something serious . Are you ill ? No . Well , what is it ? Do you ... do you believe in ... Well , yes ? In ghosts ... do you believe in ghosts ? Certainly , I do . Do n't you ? I do now . [Gasps] Oh . Oh , I see , yes . which of them was it ? Susan . Well , yes , it would be , after all those questions . You 'd better go to bed . you 'll get cold . Do you want some more hot milk ? Hmm ? Tolly : Mr . Boggis . Mrs . Tweedie told me about the fire . How far did the missing wing stretch ? Beyond the cedar tree there . They planted that ... when they tore what was left of it down . One big room for dining , drawing room , family bedrooms above . But it seems big enough as it is . Eh . I think I 'll climb the oak tree . Do
zone2	? Susan , is that you ? Granny : It 's Sefton 's spur . We 'll clean it up and put it with its pair . Is there a picture of Sefton ? Yes , it 's there . Boggis has brought the tree Into the music room . Still a bit of a mess in there , I 'm afraid . I thought we could tidy it up later . Then we could decorate the tree . You do n't have to . It 's all right . I 'll do it . Why would Sefton hide his own spur ? Oh , he didn't . he was n't the " s " . Oh , he didn't . he was n't the " s " . And the " j " was for someone who changed Susan 's life . Unfortunately , not everyone ... was pleased to see him at Green Knowe . There was a butler here then called John Caxton . He might have been kinder . Welcome home , Captain . Thank you , Caxton . thank you , one and all .
zone2	this ? Oh . She was running all over the house , sir . She would have done herself an injury . So she was tethered Like a dog . Did you know about it ? What else were we do to ? Would you rather she fell down the stairs ? She 's blind , Thomas . She simply must get used to it . But I am used to it , papa . I 'm so very , very used to it . How are you , Maria ? How should I be , after seven months in prison ... And no one but a blind girl for company ? You 've not been ill , I hope ? No , since you do n't count fatigue or melancholy ... as illness . Where 's Sefton ? Sefton : Hello , father . Were you not here to keep your mother and sister company ? Some of the time . Do n't fuss the boy . now , let 's go in . Oh , are you not curious to see what I 've brought ? My dear
zone2	. Maria : You 're too late . Lord Farrar gave him a pair last month , Finer than these , I 'm afraid . Were they , indeed , finer than these ? Well , he 's the boy 's godfather . I suppose he can give him a present . I suppose he can . Why was Farrar here ? He was staying nearby ... and looked in with some friends for an evening . Did you play ? I could hardly refuse in my own house . It would have looked extraordinary . How much did you lose , Maria ? A little . A little . A little or a lot . What difference does it make ? You 'll be angry either way . What about me , father ? Is there nothing for me ? Ah , well , now , one would have thought . Let me see . Ah , no , there seems to be nothing here , unless ... Tell me , please . Help me . Oh , mother , do say . It 's me . This ...
zone2	Now take him ' round the grounds and show him his new home . But first ... Burn it . Captain ! Is that wise ? Come , Jacob . Walk with me , And you can describe what you see . Jacob : this is a fine place . Is it ? Sure . I never saw a ... Tolly : my dad used to talk about decorating the tree in here . Look . This wash is favorite . You hang it , to remember him by . I do n't need to remember him . Yes , your father Loved this one ... When he was a boy . You could give parties In a room like this . Well , that 's what It was built for . We 'll have one when he gets back . Mm . We had wonderful dances when I was a girl . [Indistinct_singing] Mrs . Tweedie : Oh , blow me down ! what on earth is all this ? It 's a bible . Oh . It 's the Captain 's bible . How odd . I wondered
zone2	it for years . Tolly : He 's made it look as if Jacob was his son . So he has . Like this ... " ah ! " [Both_laugh] Are n't you coming in ? Of course . **26;3187;TOOLONG Where did you find him ? Well , I suppose the truth of it is that he found me . He appeared on board the day we sailed . He 's runaway . A runaway ? a runaway what ? What do you think ? a runaway slave , of course . He was going to be sold In the market at Charleston , But somehow he gave them the slip and made for the harbor . And sneaked on to your ship . He heard we were bound for england , So he swam out that night and climbed aboard . [Chuckles] I hid him in a barrel for the harbor master 's inspection , And here he is . But does n't that mean he 's somebody 's property ? I 'll pretend I did n't hear that . Is n't it forbidden to keep a stowaway aboard
zone2	any slave to freedom , I 'd break every rule in the book . Oh , he 's as bright as a button , Maria . I never knew a boy so quick . Do n't let Sefton hear you . Hmm . So , what will you do with him now ? Well , as I said , he 'll be a friend for Susan . I thought you were joking . He 'll change her life . I promise you . He can read to her . He can learn with her . He 'll be her eyes . That 's as maybe . Go on . Well , apart from anything else , He 's ... not english . Do you think such distinctions mean anything to her ? Come , come , my love . You know better than anyone ... what it is like to be a stranger in a foreign land . [Scoffs] Be kind to him . But he 's a boy . I had noticed . Then there 's Perkins . Dismiss her . Susan 's too old to have a nurse
zone2	a girl . Who 's to bathe her or dress her ? and where will he live ? Find him a room in the stables and hire a maid if you must . From now on , Jacob is Susan 's companion . You talk as if your former slave is n't even to be a servant . What will people say ? Nothing that will interest me . Sefton : We 'll be a laughing stock . I do n't expect he 'll stay long , Mr . Sefton . I do n't , really . I do n't think he 'll find he fits in . But he did fit in . Of course . Susan was blind . I should have realized . What do you mean ? How did Jacob cope with Susan 's blindness ? Oh , he would n't have thought about it . Oh ! [Chuckles] The point is , he set her free . He gave her wings . It 's much too big for just us . But we do n't care , do we ? We do not . [Chuckles]
zone2	Christopher , of course . Why is he here ? Nobody knows . he 's always stood here . Did the old part burn ? A bit . not too much . Why not ? Because Fred Boggis got a bucket line going . There was a Boggis here then ? There 's always been a Boggis at Green Knowe . [Grunts] After the fire , the Captain built a big music room ... to replace the rooms that were lost . Ah . [Sniffles] She never cared for it . [Coughs] I do n't think their marriage was all that easy . Not many of the mare , master Tolly , not too many . Are you married , Mr . Boggis ? [Sniffles] I am . Things are really quite peaceful at the moment , As it happens . Yep . Really quite peaceful . Oh . Just making a cup of coffee for your grandmother . Would you like one ? Mrs . Tweedie ? Hmm ? Have you ever seen any of them ? Any what ? Any of the people who lived here before .
zone2	do n't she ? Or have I got that wrong ? I mean Susan , for instance , or Caxton . [Scoffs] Do n't go stuffing your head ... with all that superstitious nonsense . " let the dead bury the dead " ... that 's what the bible says . I 've never understood that . How can the dead bury the dead ? I do n't know . But I do know If I do n't get a move on , This coffee 's gon na be cold . Door , please . [Door_closes] [Door_opens] Who is it ? who 's there ? What are you talking about ? It 's me , Tolly . You came before , did n't you ? What 's going on ? who are you speaking to ? Last year . In the nursery , when Perkins came and took me away . Last year ? two nights ago , you mean . Sefton : Jacob ! Jacob ! Quickly ... where can he hide ? Bring him aound here . Get him in the cupboard . Get in the cupboard !
zone2	you dare take his side . Do you think I do n't see you together , grinning and laughing ? You should n't be so funny . Mr . Sefton . Getaway from there . Leave her alone . [Gasps] Now , you come along with me , little Jacob . [Grunting] I 've got a job for you . The Captain says I 'm to stay with Susan . " Miss . Susan , " you impertinent blackguard . Miss . Susan . I was told to follow Miss . Susan 's orders . I 'm giving the orders now . Pardon , sir , butthe Captain did say ... He was only to take orders from Miss . Susan ! Keep out of this , Boggis , or you 'll be sorry . But I heard him ! Silence ! How dare you parade your insolence here ? Leave him be ! You would n't do this If papa was at home ! Well , he is n't , is he ? ! Jacob : No ! Get off ! Let him go ! Can I help ?
zone2	n't take on , Miss . Susan . He wo n't hurt him . he would n't dare . but who ... Come on . Let 's see what 's happening . [Door_creaks] No ! get off ! Unh ! Sefton , leave him alone ! Back , you cat ! control yourself . I 've got a job for him . that 's all . I shot a pheasant today that fell into the chimney , And I want it . Susan : Do n't . Jacob , do n't do it . Ca n't you stop this , Mr . Caxton ? None of this would happen If the master was home . Caxton : Hold your tongue , girl . When the Captain 's away , Mr . Sefton 's master here . Get on , you little tyke . I want my bird , and I 'm tired of waiting . Don't . do n't . It 's all right . I can do it . See ? you 're the one making all the fuss . Now take her upstairs before I really lose my
zone2	your room . He 'll be all right . [Crying] Faster ! Robert ... Light the fire . [Gasps] That 'll speed things up a bit . You do n't have to do this , you know . He ca n't force you , Robert . What kind of man are you ? Oh , well ... Robert . no . Come on . Do n't make a meal of it . My god . Fort wopins , I 'm ... You 'd what ? You 'd lose your place . that 's what . Just pray for him . that 's all we can do now . [Coughing] [Coughing_continues] [Clears_throat] [Fire_crackling] If it is n't Lord Farrar 's precious spurs . Should someone go up after him ? Caxton : and exactly who would you suggest , sir ? I maybe in for a spot of bother If anything happens to him . Boggis , clear this out . dampen it down . It was only a bit of fun , man . Where 's your sense of humor ? [Coughing] Finer than the Captain 's , are they
zone2	. It 's me . Jacob . Are you all right ? are you hurt ? I 'm all right . Will you help me play a trick on Mr . Sefton ? Maria : Oh , for heaven 's sake , Susan , I 'm too busy for this . Sefton , what 's going on ? I told you ... he sent Jacob up the chimney . Is this true ? Sefton : Why does it matter ? Is it true ? And if it is ? My darling , you 've been foolish . What will you tell your father If the boy comes to any harm ? Mr . Sefton was shooting , And a bird fell Into the chimney . Would n't it have been more foolish to have left it there ? Thank you , Caxton . When I want your advice , I shall ask for it . [Clinking] What 's that ? Jacob : Mr . Sefton , sir , I got your bird . [Gasps] Oh , my dear . Are the gentlemen shooting chickens these days ? [Laughter] That 's
zone2	it to cook ... with the rest of the bag ? Come on , Jacob . [Giggling] I 'm your mother , and I love you very much , But you must learn to control your temper , Or you 'll end up in worse trouble than this . That 'll teach him . I doubt it . What we have to put up with . Worse things happen at sea . [Laughter] Take it away , Caxton . Very good , sir . I want to be rid of him , Caxton . I want him out of this house . How dare he prance about ... waving my father 's favor in my face ? How dare he ? Patience , Mr . Sefton , patience . [Sighs] Oh , when , oh , when , will we be free of these frightful coupons ? Mum says rationing will get worse before it gets better . It will . she 's right , I 'm afraid . I mean , it seems so unfair when the war 's nearly over . If only things could get back to
zone2	normal again . Oh , yes . Well , a different normal , but normal . You take my word for it . [Bell_chiming] I 'm so glad you could come and stay . I should hate to think you had no memories of the old place Before it went . Morning . I 've got some memories now , all right . Well , you must n't be frightened . The house is bound to share some secrets . But you must n't be scared . I do n't think I 'm scared . I do n't know what I feel exactly . [Chuckling] Good . Very few people realize they do n't know what they feel ... Until they 're at least 40 . [Chuckles] Tolly , Tolly , you do understand ... death is not the important thing . What is , then ? Whether you were loved or not . That 's what people think about at the end of their lives . Do you believe that ? Yes , I do . You ca n't possibly be warm in just that . [Shivers] [Chuckles] [Shivers]
zone2	have you , Since he 's been missing ? Because I have n't . I mean , I 'm sure he 's all right ... Because if he was n't , I think ... I would have seen him by now , do n't you ? And if you had , you would have told me , would n't you ? Yes . I would have told you . And , no , I have n't seen him . That 's something , anyway . Mm-hmm . Well , here 's the shopping , what there is of it . Thank you , Tolly . Where 's Boggis ? He was working on the brambles in the tower garden . Where 's that ? Beyond the stone coronet , then turn left . [Sighs] Why wo n't he wear a proper coat ? ' Cause he 's a boy . [Door_closes] [Sighs] Boggis is kind , but if I eat another rabbit , I swear I 'll turn into one . Mrs . Tweedie : he will keep bringing them in , No matter what I say . Ohh .
zone2	know how we let it turn into this . Why is it called the tower garden ? Because of the tower . What tower ? Over there . Yeah , well , I suppose you ca n't see it now . [Sighs] When did it get so growed over ? [Sighs] [Wheelbarrow_clangs] What was it used for ? Watertower , I think , first , With a big bath underneath . A bath ? You mean , like , " having a bath " ? Yeah , I know . Seems funny , do n't it ? Can I see ? Too dark to see anything . I 've got a torch . [Groans] [Door_opens] It 's much bigger down here . A bath was a big event in those days . They dug out all these tunnels and rooms ... So they 'll have parties under the ground while they bathed . Like the Romans . Yeah . Then they put plumbing in the house ... and forgot about this place . Turned it into a garden ornament , a folly . When was this ? before the fire
zone2	Mind you ... It came in handy ... a few days before the fire happened . Why ? Never you mind . He swore it was the same a sour usual brand . It looks simply revolting . Mrs . Tweedie : war means sacrifice . I think Tolly is all right . Yes . It 's a funny old house ... to wake up and find yourself in . Yes . But it 's our funny old house . That 's what he said . Did he ? did he , really ? It 's going to have to go . [Sighs] I 'm afraid so . I do the sums . they do n't change . Ai n't there nothing you can sell ? [Chuckling] Not really . Nothing that would make any difference . You 'd think there 'll be an old master ... tucked in here somewhere . Oh , we had a Vermeer once . Heaven knows we could use it now . I just wish I did n't feel I was cheating Tolly . Oh , he 's a sensible boy . He 'll
zone2	Important things to worry about . He never stops thinking about his father , for a start . Well , none of us do . No . [Shivering] [Birds_chirping] [Insect_buzzing] Jacob : what shall we do ? Susan : we have to stop them finding him . We have to . [Indistinct_conversation] Who are you ? You can see me ? Of course I can see you . Why should n't I see you ? Who is this boy ? I think he might be a ... a relation of mine . You are , are n't you , in a way ? In a way . But I know your family , And I can assure you this ai n't none of them . Shall I start with what he 's wearing ? It 's all right , Jacob . maybe he can help . What 's happened ? Fred Boggis ... they caught him poaching . Just some hares . Now Sefton means to sell him to the gang . - What gang ? - The press gang . They kidnap men to crew the ships . Why
zone2	So he 'll have to go with the gang , And Sefton and Caxton will split what they can get for him . The stupid thing is , my father would save him , And he 's due back anyday . Caxton knows he 's still here somewhere . He 's watching us all the time . Where 's Fred hiding ? There 's a maze of tunnels under the old watertower . I know it . I 'll find him . Go to the kitchen first . He has n't had anything to eat for three days . And you can find out if you 're visible or not . Excuse me ? [Light_laughter] Nothing from the Captain yet , Mrs . Robbins . Most inconsiderate , I must say . How can we plan our menus ... without so much as a " by your leave " ? Menus are not of much interest to the Admiralty , Mrs . Gross . Yes , girl ? I was just wondering ... if there was any news about Fred Boggis . Really , Rose ? Well , I was
zone2	Because if not , why do we pay your wages ? Yes , Mrs . Gross . [Gasps] [Gasps] Not that I would n't like to give her a word of comfort . Mr . Sefton 's very hard on young Boggis . That I do think . Mr . Caxton 's put him up to it . Mr . Caxton gets above hisself when the Captain 's away . He 's cleverer than the people he works for . If you ask me , that 's always a recipe for trouble . And he certainly takes on ... a great many of the Captain 's duties . Now , now . [Gasps] aah ! Rose , whatever is the matter with you , girl ? I-I just ... Nothing , ma'am . I cut my finger . Get on with your work . Yes , ma'am . I just need to get some more milk , ma'am . Who are you ? Are you a ... ghost ? I do n't think I can be . I mean , I 'm not dead . Come to think of it
zone2	? Never mind all that . I need something for Fred Boggis to eat . Fred ? - Can you help ? - Of course . Have you seen him ? Is he all right ? I do n't know yet . What about this pie ? [Gasps] [Chuckles_nervously] Well , that will never work . Put it inside your clothes . That might do it . It 's worth a try . Well , what if Caxton and his men can see you ? Some people can . I did . Let 's just hope they ca n't , then . If you do get to Fred , tell him to look after himself . Tell him Rose said so . I will . Aah ! [Indistinct_conversations] [Gasps] [Breathing_heavily] [Indistinct_conversations] [Birds_chirping] [Water_dripping] Fred ? Are you down here ? Fred ? Fred ? Fred ? Are you here ? Fred ? Susan told me to come . [Footsteps] Who are you ? You can see me , then . Of course I can . And I should think everyone else can see you , too . No , no
zone2	a torch . I 've brought you some food . Torch ? It 's not even burning . How 's it work ? Here . Thanks . The message is , you 've got to stay here . But they 'll find me . They 've searched it twice already . One of them came so close , I could smell his breath . Next time they 're gon na get me for sure . No , I have to make a run for it ... No , the Captain will be home any day now , any moment . I promise . And that 's what Miss . Susan says ? It is . All right . I 'll stay , though I may regret it . Keep hidden . and good luck . You would n't lend me that , would you ? Gets so dark down here . Keep it . Do n't use it too much . The battery will run out , And I do n't expect you 'll be able to get another . What 's battery ? It 's a big question .
zone2	. Did she , now ? Rose ? Fancy that . [Door_creaks] [Wings_fluttering] [Birds_squawking] Granny : At last we 've solved the mystery ... of the miracle light . It 's been part of our mythology for so long . Has it ? I ca n't think why I did n't guess . It 's obvious , once you know . It was a present from my daddy . Well , then you both helped Fred . Granny ? This morning I had the torch in my pocket . Yes . But it was already in the case . Mm , I suppose that 's right . But surely is n't that impossible ? [Chuckling] Well ... obviously not . There 's one thing I do n't understand . Only one ? Lucky old you . Seriously ... with ghosts , Why is it that some people can see them and some ca n't , But then others can only see them sometimes ? Well , I do n't know . It might depend on being open . Maybe we get so full of our own affairs , We block
zone2	them , ca n't they ? Oh , yes . Now , look ... I 've got some very tedious business to attend to . Why do n't you go off for a walk ? I 'll see you at lunch . Allright . Bismarck , go with him . [Bismarck_groans] What a useless dog . Granny , would it be all right if I go down to the vill ... Thomas : Are you so lost to proportion , sir , that even supposing ... you were entitled to feel aggrieved with this man , which you were not , it seemed reasonable to you ... to condemn him to 10 years of slavery ? Well may you be silent . You are weak and easily led . And those who are easily led are not easily followed . [Sighs] You are a disgrace to this family . - Now go to your room . - Maria : Thomas ... To your room , sir ! [Door_opens] , closes I 'm sad , Caxton . After our years together , I would have looked for something better . Your
zone2	month 's wages in lieu of notice . But , Thomas , you ca n't mean that . The Farrars will be here in two days . I ca n't receive them in a house with no one to run it . Get one of the footmen to cover his duties . One of the footmen ? After all the hospitality I 've had from them ? My mind is made up . But you do n't understand ! the Greshams are coming ! The Carberys are coming ! the Northbrooks are coming ! - It 'll be a disaster ! - Put them off . Put them off ? Do you know how long it 's taken me ... to get them to say yes ? They 've never been here before . I hardly know them . What will they think of me if the house is in chaos ? Why do you invite people you do n't know ? Because , Thomas , I 'm trying to build something . I 'm trying to make a life for myself . Is n't that what you want ?
zone2	I done ? Well , I 'm sure you 'll manage . [Bells_chiming] I could work out my notice , sir , If you 'd let me ... Just until you find someone else to take over . Out of the question . Surely I 'm entitled to one favor , Thomas . And after all the time Caxton 's been with us , Is it so much to ask ? It is . The answer 's no . I feel as if I 'm in a crow 's nest , looking out to sea . When I was little , I wanted to be a sailor just like papa . Not anymore ? I 'm blind , and I 'm female . I doubt the navy has a place for me . Then why not be a great explorer And cross all seven seas ? Do you really think I could ? Someone will . why not you ? Jacob , nothing 's Impossible , is it , Not when you really want it ? What are you doing ? I 'm carving our initials , Miss . Susan
zone2	then they can say , " ' that 's the famous Lady traveler ... " and her faithful companion . " [Chuckles] [Birds_chirping] I wonder what Sefton would say If he could see us up here . Yep . I wonder . Thank you , sir . If I hear of anymore such incidents , Maria , I will hold you to blame . Do you understand me ? Oh , perfectly . I 'd be amazed If you did n't blame me . [Sighs] Maria , my dear , you must n't think that I ... No , that 's right . I must n't think . I must n't think , or I 'll go mad . I must n't think that you 'll leave me alone ... in this desert for months and years ... while you swan round europe playing tag with the French . There must be something you can do besides gambling . And what would that be , pray ? Paying calls on neighbors who do n't like me , who find me funny and foreign and not to be trusted ? Or
zone2	helping the vicar ? Yes , I see what you mean . I do n't want you to be bored . Then you 're doomed to disappointment . We both are . The truth is , my dear , we 're not well matched . Which is my fault , I presume ? The fault is with neither or both of us . We thought we could be happy , but we 're not , And it 's too late now for regrets . Who 's that climbing with Jacob in the oak tree ? He should be looking after Susan , Not larking about with some boy from the village , And why does Boggis allow it ? What are they playing at ? Village boy ? Do n't you recognize your ladylike daughter ? [Laughter] It ca n't be . If you mean it should n't be , I quite agree with you . But how can she ? she 's ... Blind ? Oh , my dear , That does n't get in the way of anything these days . Was this what you wanted ... when
zone2	! [Grunts] Over here ! Father ? Oh , do n't be angry . You ca n't climb a tree in a stupid dress . Trousers are much more sensible . Give me 10 minutes to change , And I shall look like a model lady , I promise . She 's a good climber , sir . And the clothes were my idea . Come here . Say you 're not cross , please , papa . At any rate , not with her , sir . [Voice_breaking] I 'm not cross . I 'm not cross at all . I 'm not cross with any of you . Tolly : so , was everything all right after Caxton had gone ? No , I 'm afraid not ... because he had n't gone . He was still there ... when a messenger came later that same day , calling the Captain back to his ship . Oh , custard . He should have waited until Caxton left . Oh , my dear , any sailor summoned to the wars must go . [Footsteps_departing] [Door_opens] [Door_opens] Caxton ! hurry
zone2	. [Indistinct_conversations] Sefton . how are you ? If you 'll all like to go to your rooms , We 'll have tea in here at 5:00 . Nellie , tell Miss . Susan to join us ... And put her into the dress that matches this one . And Jacob , ma'am ? Oh , send him back to the stables . We wo n't need him again today . Miss . Susan , your mother wants you to join her . Come and change your frock . Not you , Jacob . There 's some tea in the kitchen . I hate the way she treats you . Go . [Conversations_continue] Susan , over here . Can this charming newcomer be dear little Susan ? Curtsey to Lord Farrar , dear . [Laughing] Oh ! A fine snub for you , my Lord . My sister meant no insult , Mrs . Carbery . She 's quite blind . Oh , dear . I 'm sorry to hear that , Mrs . Oldknow . [Chuckling] I do n't recall you ever mentioning it before . How vexing for
zone2	To have a child born blind is very vexing . Come here , my dear . sit by me . Of course . Aah ! Oh , Lord ! Jacob ! Man : is she all right ? Oh , my dear . Do n't worry . I 'm here . Jacob , I thought you were told to go back to the stables . Beg pardon , ma'am , But the Captain likes me to keep a close eye on Miss . Susan , If that 's no bother to anyone . Bravo ! I wish I had someone to keep me out of mischief . Your wife will manage that , surely , my Lord . [Chuckling] I 'm afraid it would take up too much of her time . You 've found yourself quite a champion , Susan . I think so . I 'm sure all the ladies in the room ... envy you your protector . That 's enough , Susan . You 'll wear us out with your chatter . Go along . We hope to see you later on ... and your gallant
