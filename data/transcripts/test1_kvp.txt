Bet you ca n't even hit the net . - Yeah , how about a home run , Babe Ruth ? - Sure , I dare you to . With one throw , I could knock them dames off of their bunks . Go to it , big boy . Do n't overlook me , carrot top . I have the shape that makes the old men young and the young men old . - Attaboy . - Mama wants Papa . - Papa wants Mama . Some mamas too . Now somebody else .

Oh , Matt , honest , I ai n't ever laughed like this . - You 're funny . - Sure , I 'd think it was blarney if it was n't meself was making you laugh . Oh , sure , Anna , you 're crazy about me , and I 'm not after blaming you . You just hate yourself , do n't you , Matt ?

And skoal , Matt , to you and me . - Hot mustard , Matt ? - I do n't need it . - Pepper ? - Full of it . - Well , here 's something you do need . - Oh , is that so , now ? Well , all right . But if I 'm needing sugar , I know where to
zone1	Matt . Just like a couple of kids . Sure , Anna , when you 're in love , you ai n't got the brains of a tick . What do you mean , love ? You know what I mean , Anna . It 's in me eye and on the tip of me tongue . A man like me ai n't given to loving a woman . He knows too much about them . Every color of them , from here to the China Sea . The whole lying , cheating smear of them . Sailors ' bait . When he comes across a girl like you , Anna that 's as clean as a shell . You 're a lucky girl to be hearing such talk from the lips of Matt Burke him that the women are so crazy over . Anna , what 's come over you ? Oh , nothing . Sure , do n't lie to me , Anna . You 're as stiff as a corpse . Hello , dearie . - Well , I 'll be ... - Well , she 's
zone1	? I 'm afraid I do n't remember you . - She do n't remember me . - Of course she do n't , you old scab . - Beat it , or I 'll have you thrown in the brig . - No , Matt , maybe I do know her . That old sea cow ? Go on , clear out of here . You know a nice young girl never met the likes of you . A nice young ... ? A nice young ... Pure and white as a lily . Shut up , or I 'll choke the wind out of your gullet . Oh , Matt , let her alone . She do n't mean nothing by it . Anna . Anna , darling . You see what you 've done ? You frightened her . - Go on , clear out of here . - I 'm going , I 'm going . Let her alone . Do n't go . I was lying , Matt . I know her and she knows me . I recognized her the minute she stepped across
zone1	n't have to spill over for nobody . You ai n't responsible for what your old man does . I 'll tell you why she did n't want to talk to me . Because I 'm a tramp , that 's why . And her old man kicked me off the barge when she come there to live on it . Yeah , he did n't want any old wharf rat around a nice young girl . Well , it ai n't so , though , Matt . She 's lying . Lying , I 'm ly ... ? Well , I like your nerve , all right , all right . Gee , I 'm sorry I came here to speak to you . Insulting me . Well , can you beat it ? I 'll be toddling along . I 'm glad you found yourself such a nice , friendly gent . I hope you 're happy , kid . I 'm sorry I bothered you , honest , I ... Oh , forget it , Ann . You only got one life to live . And it
zone1	, skipper , you would n't stake me to a quarter , would you ? You know , I have n't had a drink in a month . Take it and beat it . With pleasure , captain . Well , so long . Be a good girl , Ann , no matter how lonesome . Happy days . Happy days . The poor old devil . Sometimes I feel sorry for them . Come on , Anna . Do n't let it get you down . Sure , the world 's full of them . I know it 's a sad sight for a decent young girl the like of yourself , darling . What would you say , Matt , if I told you that ... ? Say what , me darling ? Tell me what . Oh , nothing . Sure , I know what you 'll be wanting to tell me soon , if not this minute that you love me . Do n't be so sure of yourself , Matt . I 'm loving nobody . And you 'll be wanting to marry me ,
zone1	Matt . You want to marry me ? - Honest ? - Sure , I 'll marry you . Only , do n't be putting me to too many tests , or I might change me mind . I 'm tired , Matt . I wan na go back to the barge . You ... You think you love that sailor fella , Anna ? Well , what if I do ? You think maybe you marry him ? No . I 'm glad you do n't marry sailor , Anna . Is bad for woman . They do n't never see their men only once in long while . You sit and wait all alone and when their boys grow up and go on sea they sit and wait some more . Any girl marry sailor is crazy fool , I tell you . Your mother , she tell you same thing if she was alive . Well , that ai n't why I wo n't marry him . I 'm not thinking about myself but about him . He 's such a simple guy , a big kid
zone1	him . You fool him ? Oh , you go crazy , I think . I 've been thinking I was myself the last few days . I 'll be outside . I love to watch the ships passing . When Matt comes along , tell him where I am , will you ? All right , I tell him . Well , God bless who 's here . How 's the world treating you this afternoon , Anna 's father ? Oh , pretty good , if it ai n't for some fellas . Meaning me , do you ? Well , if you ai n't the funny old crank of a man . Where 's herself ? - Where 's Anna , I 'm after asking you . - She gone out to look on boat . Well , I 'll be going out to her . But before I go , I 'll take this chance while we 're alone to have a word with you . And that word is soon done . I 'm marrying your Anna before this day is out . You may
zone1	it or no . That 's easy for saying . You mean I wo n't ? Is it yourself is after stopping me , do you think ? - I stop it if it come to worst . - Sure , it is n't trouble I 'm looking for . You 're her father . Would n't it be a shame for us to be at each others ' throats like a pair of dogs , and I married to Anna . So out with the truth , man alive . What is it you 're holding against me at all ? I do n't want my Anna for got married . Listen , you fella . I 'm old man . I do n't see my Anna for 15 year . She 's all I got in the world . You think now when she come on first trip , I want her for leave me alone again ? Sure , let you not be thinking I 've no heart at all for the way you 'd be feeling . Then you do right thing , eh ? You
zone1	, big fella like you on sea , he do n't need a wife . He got new girl in every port , you know that . Oh , shut up . Sure , there 's a time come to every man , on sea or land when he 's sick of the lot of them cows , and wearing his heart out to meet up with some fine , decent girl and building a home to call his own , rearing up children in it . Sure , Anna 's the one woman in the world for me and I ca n't live without her now , I 'm thinking . You think I 'm going let her life be made sorry by you just like her mother 's was made by me ? No , she do n't marry you . Not if I have to kill you first . Glory be to God , what talk from a stumpy runt of a man . It is queer fool 's blather you have , about the sea done this and the sea done that . You ought to
zone1	old sailor . I 'm hearing a lot from you , and a lot more that Anna tells me you do be saying to her . I 'm thinking it is a poor weak thing you are . Not a man at all . You see if I 'm man maybe quicker than you think . You know the truth in your heart . The sea hit you a clout once and knocked you down . You 're not man enough to get up for another , but you lie there howling murder . I 'd like to see you in the best of your youth . - Do what I done in the storm and after . - Why , you young fool , you . In old days , when I was on windjammer I went through hundred storms worse than that . Ships were ships then , and men what sailing them real men . What you got on steamers now ? You got fellas on deck do n't know a ship from a mud scow and below deck , you got fellas just know how to
zone1	wagon ashore , you . Is it throwing insults at the men in the stokehold you are , you old ape ? One of them is worth any 10 squareheads ever shipped on a windbag . - You Irish swine . - So you do n't like the Irish , you old baboon ? Sure , it 's that you 're needing in your family . An Irishman . A man of the stokehold to put guts in it so you 'll not be rearing up grandchildren to be jackasses like yourself . Sure , old men getting childish should n't play with knives . Faith , I 've half a mind to hit you a clout will put sense in your square head . Keep away from me , now . Hello , Matt . Are you here already ? Say , what 's up ? How did that chair get knocked over ? Oh , Matt , you have n't been fighting with him , after you promised ? I 've not laid a hand on him , Anna . I told him to his teeth I love
zone1	you know it . He tell same thing to girl in every port he goes . I know it 's true , Matt . Do n't you mind what he says . God bless you . And then I said I thought maybe you 'd have a bit of love for me too . So you told him that ? Maybe I have . I 've been wondering if I do love you . I did n't want to , I must own up to that . But I ... I guess I ca n't help it , so I guess I do . Oh , sure , I do , Matt . What 's the use of kidding myself different ? - Sure , I love you . - God be praised . And I have n't ever loved a man in my life before , never . Faith , we 'll be having a grand , beautiful life together to the end of our days . Matt . - Goodbye , Matt . - Goodbye , is it ? I 'll be coming at you in a second
zone1	man when you 're beat fair and square . Here 's me hand to you . We 'll be friends from this out . No , I do n't shake hands with you , fella . Not while I live . The back of me hand to you , then , if that suits you . It 's a rotten bad loser you are , devil mend you . No , I do n't lose . Anna said she like you little bit . But you do n't hear her say she marry you , I bet . No , and I do n't hear her say the sun is shining , either . - No , I did n't say it , Matt . - There , you hear ? You 're waiting to be asked , you mean ? Well , I 'm asking you now . We 'll be wedded this day , with the help of God . - You heard what I said after I kissed you . - I do n't remember . I said goodbye . That kiss was for goodbye , Matt
zone1	you . We 've said goodbye , that 's all . - I knew that was so . - Is it making game of me you 'd be ? It 's a queer time to joke with me . Do n't be doing it , for the love of God . You do n't think I 'd kid you now . I 'm not joking , Matt . I mean what I say . You do n't . You ca n't . It is mad you are , I 'm telling you . - No , I 'm not . - What 's come over you so sudden ? You were saying you love me . I 'll say that as often as you want me to . It 's true . But why ? What ? What is it ? Because it 's the best way I can figure out , Matt . I 've been thinking it over and thinking it over , day and night , all week . Oh , do n't think it is n't hard on me too , Matt . Well , will
zone1	two of us has love ? I 'm thinking it 's listening to that old fool you are him hating me , filling your ears full of lies against me . Yes , Anna believe me , not you . She know her old father do n't lie like you . You sit down , do you hear ? Why do you come butting in and making things worse ? You 're like a devil , you are . Here I was , beginning to like you , beginning to forget all the things I 've held up against you . - You ai n't got nothing for hold against me . Have n't I , though ? Well , let me tell you . Matt , I 'm surprised at you . - You did n't think anything he 'd said ... - Sure , what else would it be ? Tell me , and do n't keep me waiting . I ca n't tell you , and I wo n't . I 've got a good reason , that 's all you need to know . I ca
zone1	to it . So for heaven 's sake , let 's talk of something else . No , I 'll not . - Is it married to someone else you are ? - I should say not . You 're like them women ca n't make up their minds till they 're drove to it . Well , I 'll make up your mind for you . We 've had enough talk . Let 's go to the other room and dress in your best . We 're going ashore . - She do n't do that . - Where do you get that stuff ? Never mind , get on with your dressing . - We 'll see who 'll win in the end , me or you . - Stay , Anna . She will not . She 'll do what I say . You 've had your hold on her long enough . - It 's my turn now . - Your turn ? What am I anyway ? Never mind what you are . It 's what you 're gon na be : Wedded to me
zone1	do one thing he say ! - She will ! - I 'm her father . - She will in spite of you . She 's taking my orders from now on , not yours . Orders is good . Never mind now . We 've no time to be wasting . - Do you hear what I 'm telling you ? - No , stay here , Anna ! You can go to blazes , both of you . You 'd think I was a piece of furniture . I 'll show you . Sit down . Sit down , do you hear ? Let me talk for a minute . You 're all wrong , see ? I 'm gon na tell you two something , and then I 'm gon na beat it . I 've been meaning to turn it loose on you every time you get my goat with your crazy talk about wanting to keep me safe inland . I was n't going to tell you , but you 've forced me into it . Oh , what 's the use ? It 's
zone1	this way as any other . Do n't forget what you said about it not mattering to you what reason I got as long as I was n't married already . That 's me word , and I 'll stick to it . You make me laugh , honest . Wan na bet you will ? You wait and see . You was going on as if one of you had to own me . But nobody owns me , see , excepting myself . I 'll do what I please . And no man , I do n't give a darn who he is can tell me what to do . I ai n't asking either of you for a living . I 'll make it myself , one way or another . I am my own boss . Now , put that in your pipe and smoke it . - You and your orders . - I was n't meaning it that way at all and well you know it . You 've no call to raise this rumpus with me . - It is him , you
zone1	. But you , you did mean it that way . You sounded just like all the rest . It is queer , rough talk , that , for a decent girl the like of yourself . Decent . Who told you I was ? I 'm talking to you now . I do n't want to hear . You go out your head , I think . Well , living with you is enough to drive anyone off their nut . Your bunk about the farm being so fine . Did n't I write you , year after year , how rotten it was and what a dirty slave them cousins made out of me ? What did you care ? Nothing . Not even enough to come out and see me . Your crazy stuff about wanting to keep me away from the sea do n't go down with me . You just did n't want to be bothered with me . - Oh , that ai n't so , Anna . - But one thing I never wrote you it was one of them cousins that you
zone1	And it was none of my fault . I hated him and he knew it . But he was big and strong , like you . That 's why I ran away from the farm . That 's what made me get a job as a nurse girl in St . Paul . You think that was a nice job for a girl , too , do n't you ? With all them nice inland fellas just looking for a chance to marry me . They were n't looking for marrying . You do n't say nothing . Either one of you . But I know what you 're thinking . You 're just like all the rest . And who 's to blame for it ? Me or you ? If you 'd been a regular father and had me with you things would 've been different . - Do n't talk that way . - I go crazy . I wo n't listen to you . - You will listen . You , keeping me safe inland . I was no nurse girl the last two years .
zone1	a house , that 's what . Yes , that kind of a house . The kind that sailors like Matt and you go to in port and your nice inland men too . And all men . I hate them , I hate them ... - Oh , it 's a lie , Anna , it 's a lie ... - So that 's what 's in it . I suppose you remember your promise . No other reason was to count with you as long as I was n't married already . You want me to get dressed and go ashore , do n't you ? Oh , yes , you do . I suppose if I tried to tell you that I was n't that no more you 'd believe me , would n't you ? And if I told you that just getting out on this barge and being on the sea had changed me and made me feel different about things as if all that I 've been through was n't me , did n't count it was just like it never happened you 'd
zone1	laughing , I 'm sure , if I told you that meeting you that funny way that night in the fog and afterwards , seeing that you were straight good stuck on me had got me to thinking for the first time in my life . And I sized you up as different from the one's on land , as water is from mud . I could n't marry you with you believing a lie . And I was ashamed to tell you the truth . And now , give me a bawling-out and beat it like I can tell you 're going to . Will you believe it if I tell you that loving you has made me clean ? It 's straight goods , honest . Oh , yes , you will . You 're just like all the rest . The rest , is it ? My curse on you . Clean , is it ? Oh , do n't , Matt . Get out of here . Let me alone . Get out of here ! I 'll be going . And I 'll be drinking
zone1	yours off me lips ! And I 'd be getting dead , rotten drunk so I 'll not remember you at all ! I 'll ship away on a boat to the end of the world , where I 'll never see your face again ! - Oh , do n't go . It 's better Anna marry you ... - Let go of me , you old ape ! Marry her , is it ? I 'd see her dead at me feet first . I 'm shipping away out of this , I 'm telling you . My curse on you , and the curse of all the saints . - I go ashore too . - Not after him , I tell you . Do n't you dare . Oh , I go for get drink . I 'm driving you to drink too , huh ? You wan na get drunk so you can forget , like him . Aye . You think I like hear them things ? Oh , Anna . Anna , I think you was n't that kind of girl . You
zone1	You do n't want me here disgracing you , I suppose . Oh , no , no , Anna . You stay here . It ai n't your fault , I know that . It 's that old devil do this to me . It was all right on barge , with just you and me . Then she bring that Irish fellow in fog . That fella , he do n't never come , you do n't never tell me them things . I do n't never know . Then everything is all right . Oh , that dirty devil sea . Oh , what 's the use ? Go ashore and get drunk . You wait here , Anna ? Maybe . Maybe not . Maybe I 'll get drunk too . Maybe I 'll ... 0h , what do you care what I do ? Go on and beat it . It 's foggy outside . Oh , God . - What 's the trouble ? Feeling sick ? - Inside my head feels sick . Oh , Anna , you think maybe sometime you forgive me
zone1	. - Oh , Anna lilla . Oh , do n't bawl about it . There ai n't nothing to forgive anyway . It ai n't your fault , it ai n't mine . It ai n't his , neither . I fix everything all right for you and me , Anna . Yes ? Then you and me will stick together ? We 'll work for each other and help each other , huh ? - What is it you fixed ? - Well , I sign on steamer Londonderry . Sail for Cape Town tomorrow . Oh , Anna , I only bring you bad luck . That 's how you fix me , is it ? Well , I think that old devil get me back maybe she leave you alone , then . Oh , ca n't you see that you 're doing the same thing that you 've always done ? Ca n't you see that ? Oh , what 's the use of talking ? You ai n't right . I 'll never blame you anymore . Oh , Anna . You forgive me
zone1	to blame . You 're just what you are , like me . And you , you let me kiss you once again , eh ? - Oh , sure , no hard feelings . - Oh , Anna lilla . I ca n't say it , Anna . I think I go lie down , go to sleep . Oh , that booze , he do n't go well , Anna . I think I 'm never going to drink again . I ca n't stand this much longer . What am I waiting for , anyhow , like a darn fool ? Anna ? - Anna ? - Yes , what do you want ? Do n't say it . I know what 's in your mind . Yes , that 's what I was , and that 's what I 'm going back to . I 'd kill you first . And finish it up . It 's a dog 's life I been living since I found out what you are . Oh , why do n't you leave me alone . Go away . Do
zone1	want to keep kicking me for ? Do n't you deserve the worst I 'd say , God forgive you ? All right , maybe I do . But do n't rub it in . Why have n't you done what you said you were going to ? Ship away to the other side of the earth , where you do n't have to see me . - I have . - What ? You 're going away , honest ? I signed on , drunk as I was , and she 's sailing tomorrow . - Where is she going ? Far away ? - Cape Town . It is at the end of Africa . That 's far for you . - What 's the boat 's name ? - The Londonderry . The Londonderry ? Oh , this is too much . Faith , I do n't blame you for laughing at me . True , it is the fool of the world I am to come back to talk to you at all . Oh , what 's the use ? What 's the use of
zone1	Anna ... Anna , if I could only be believing I was the only man in the world ever you had love for , I could be forgetting the rest , maybe . Are you trying to accuse me of being in love really in love , with them ? You fool , you . I 've stood enough from you . Love them , is it ? I hated them , I tell you . And may God strike me dead , and my mother too , if she was alive if I 'm not telling you the honest truth . Oh , sure , Anna , if I could only be believing you , now . Why , Matt , you 've got to believe it . What can I do ? What will I do to prove to you I 'm not lying ? Anna , would you ... ? Would you be willing to swear an oath , a terrible , fearful oath ? Oh , sure , I will , Matt , on anything . Would you swear on this ? Oh , sure .
zone1	to me by me mother , God rest her soul . And I 'm telling you , it has great power in it . And I 'm warning you now , if you swear on this it is me old woman herself who 'd be looking down on you from heaven and praying the saints to put a curse on you if she hears you swear a lie . I would n't have the nerve , honest , Matt , if it was a lie . But it 's the truth , and I ai n't scared to swear it . Give it to me . What do you want me to swear ? You say it . Swear I 'm the only man in the world ever you felt love for . I swear it . I swear it by God . And may the blackest curse of God strike you if you 're lying . And may the blackest curse of God strike me if I 'm lying . Oh , glory be to God , I 'm after believing you now . - Now what 's the
zone1	No , why ? - Oh , God pity me . Sure , it 's some devil 's treachery in it . You swearing on a Catholic cross , and you one of the others . - Well , do n't you believe me , Matt ? - Oh , but if it ai n't a Catholic you are ... I ai n't nothing , Matt . What 's the difference ? Did n't you hear me swear ? I 'm afraid I love you , God forgive me , no matter what you are . I 'd be going mad if I 'd not be having you . I 'd be killing the world . We 'll be wedded this day . And we 'll be happy , the two of us , in spite of the devil . Well , we got ta have a drink on this , my good man . - Blast you . - That 's the way to talk . Oh , Matt , it 's time for you two to kiss and make up . You 'll be shipmates on the Londonderry
zone1	? - Aye , and I 'm boatswain on her . The devil ! You 'd be shipping away to sea and leaving her alone again , will you ? It 's all right , Matt . That 's where he belongs , and I want him to go . You 've got ta go too . We 'll need the money . And as for me being alone , why , that runs in the family and I 'll get used to it . I 'll get a house somewhere and I 'll make a regular place for you two to come back . And now you 'll drink and be friends , huh ? Sure . - Here 's luck to you . - Skoal . Well , you 'll not be lonesome long . I 'll see to that , God willing . Sure as himself will be having a grandchild riding his foot , I tell you . - Maybe twins . - Oh , quit your kidding . Is it any religion at all you have , you and your Anna ? Well , in
zone1	is it ? Oh , then I 'm damned entirely . Oh , well , what 's the difference ? It is God 's will anyhow . It 's queer , you and me shipping on same boat that way . That ai n't right . It 's that funny way old devil sea do her worst dirty tricks . Aye , is so . Faith , I 'm afraid you 've the right of it for once , devil take you . Why , gee , Matt , you ai n't agreeing with him , are you ? Come on . Here 's to the sea , no matter what . Be a game sport , man . Drink to that . Fog , fog all time . You ca n't tell where you was going . Only that old devil sea . She knows .

I see they 're hiring men down at the tannery this morning . Yes , I 'm just reading about it in the paper . They only pay 2 ' 5 a day . Wear more than that out in shoe leather walking that far to work . You must wear pretty expensive shoes . I do n't pay any more for my shoes than anybody
zone1	unless they pay me what I 'm worth . Pa 's got a weak back and he just wo n't admit it . Besides , he 's sort of waiting on a government job that 's been promised to him . - I did n't know that . Let 's see , that 's one dollar . 25 , 50 , 70 . 80 , 85 , 90 . 95 , 96 , 97 , 98 , 99 ... - Two dollars , that 's right , is n't it ? - There 's your receipt . - Thank you . - Goodbye . - What 's the matter , Ma ? - I 'm short of 25 cents .

Who did this terrible thing ? Take your seats . I 'm going to find out who did this . I would hate to think that one of my little girls would do such a thing . Do n't look at me , teacher . I ca n't draw that good . No , I do n't believe you did it , Susan . - Who

Go to the kitchen where you belong . Do n't drop that jam on the floor . Go on . Pa ! Stop it ! You 've whipped him enough ! He did n't mean to be bad .

Howard sent over a big bundle of sowing . That will help some . Well , if it 's clear in the morning , call me early . Yes , Pa . Pa ! Pa ! Pa ! Pa , get off of your back ! 16 dollars and 83 cents .

Congratulations , Isabelle . Of course , this is a tremendous surprise for everybody . We 've only been expecting this since you were about that high . Isabelle , I wish you both ... the best of everything . Isabelle , you 're getting a mighty fine boy . I know it . Johnny . When do you and Isabelle intend to get married ? Well ... We 'd like to get married as soon as we could . - But probably not until spring anyway . - No , do n't you put it off on my account
zone1	'll get along alright . About time anyway we stop living off of you . You know that ... government job that was promised to me ? Well , I got tired of waiting for it . I 've lined up something else . Gon na pay me plenty of money too . That 's great ! What is it , Pa ? I do n't want to talk about it yet . I always say : deliver the goods first , talk afterwards .

No effort at all . Les , would you like to have a little Tom and Jerry ? If it ai n't too little . Now children , I know you 're cold after you arrived . And if you come in here with me , we may find something to warm me up . Of course it ai n't New York , but it 's good . Women and children first ! Ben , he 's just got a natural sense of humour . - I 'm so disappointed Phyllis could n't come . - She sends you her love , Ma . I 'll tell you all about it later . - I have a secret . - What ?

That tells the story . - You old ... - Thanks for the booze . - They do n't call in that . - You mean you find it out soon enough . Ca n't something be done about this before it 's too late .

I wish I may , I wish I might . Have this wish I wish tonight . - What are you wishing ? - If I tell you , it wo n't come true . On the level , do you like the ring ? Like it ? I 'm as proud as I can be . How about the receipt ? Keep your eyes open and your trap shut . Make it snappy . Listen , Shelby . You turn off the road at Angus ' place , take the short cut to Cedars . And when you get to the garage , go in the back way , Mac will be waiting there for you . - Did you get that ? - Yes . I 'll be in in just a minute , mother dear . I 'll be over for you
zone1	to stop you , step on it . Pa ! Johnny ! Johnny , you go on and get out of here . Go on home , go on ! Pa , what are you doing with the truck ? Johnny , I want you to get away from here . I do n't want you to get in any trouble . Now , go on , go on home ! So that 's the job you were talking about , eh ? Are you going to get out of here ? You mind your own business . Go on ! Pa , you ca n't get away with a thing like this . You must be crazy ! Pa , I 'm ashamed of you . This will kill Ma . Now , come on , Pa . Let 's leave the car here and go home . Johnny , we could n't do that . The stuff is here and they 'll trace the car to the house . Now go on . Alright , Pa , I 'll unload the stuff . You go on home ,
zone1	want anything to happen to you . - That 's alright , go on home . - I did n't want to do this . - Go on ! - Did you find anything ? - No . Those shots came from the big car . That big car was a decoy , it let the little car get away . - What 's that ? - Wait a minute . Merry Christmas , Ma ! Merry Christmas , children . Did you sleep well ? Great . That smells good . No , you need n't bother at all . Everything 's all ready . Where 's a fellow wash his face around here ? Ben ! I 'll show you where it is , come on . - Have a heart , have a heart ! - You , baby !

And I wish you were just that little , so I can bundle you all off , give you your lunch pails and send you to school . - What would you think about that ? - That would n't be hard to take . Hurry and wash your face and hands , now breakfast is almost ready . Alright , Ma . What a delightful performance ! That old oaken bucket , that iron-bound bucket , that moss-covered bucket , that hangs , that hangs ... - Merry Christmas , Pa ! - The same to you , Susan . Hurry and get yourself ready for breakfast . Alright , Ma . Isaac and Minnie are coming and bringing the children , so we 're all having breakfast together . Ma , there were n't any more strowberries , so I got raspberries . Is that alright ? - That 's perfectly alright , dear . - It 's cold out here ! Good morning , Pa , and a great big Merry Christmas ! Ben ! Ben
zone1	in there until Minnie and Isaac come with the children . I was just trying to see what Santa Claus put in my stocking . Ma , I wish they 'd hurry . Poor Ben is just starving to death . Well , I guess we wo n't wait any longer then . Ma , where 's Johnny ? He was out late last night and he is n't up yet . Johnny , breakfast is ready . We ca n't wait any longer . Now hurry along , son ! Come right along ! Well , Ben , you sit there and ... Susan sits there and ... Thomas ! Thomas ! - Alright , Ma . - Come , sit right here next to me . Come on , Pa ! Pa , will you please say grace ? Our Lord , we give thee ... Just in time , Isaac . - Good morning , Isaac . - Good morning . Pa , I want to speak to you . - What 's Isaac so serious about ? - Something 's happened . I hope it is
zone1	do ? - Pa , what is it ? - It 's Johnny . - Johnny ? What 's happened to him ? - He is n't hurt ! - He 's in jail . Jail ? - Isaac , you 're fooling ! - What for ? What did he do ? The police caught him with his car full of liquor . I do n't believe you ! I ca n't believe you ! My Johnny is in his room ! - I 'll show you . - I 'll go , Ma . In the attic bedroom . He 's brought disgrace upon us . Having liquor in your car is no disgrace . It 's only a small fine . It is n't even serious . An officer was shot ! That 's serious , is n't it ? Isaac , no ! My Johnny would n't hurt anyone . - Ma ! Ma ! - Yes ? Ma , he 's not upstairs ! And his bed has n't been slept in . Pa ! Pa ! Did you hear ? Johnny 's been arrested
zone1	do something ? - Why do n't you do something ? - Ma ! Ma ! - You 've got to take it easy . - Johnny ! - Tommy , how much money you 've got ? - None , to speak of . It 's gon na take a lot of money to bail him out of a charge like that . - How about you , Isaac ? - Be sure , your sins will find you out . Now , you let us help . Listen , everything 's going to be alright . - She 's fainted . - Give her a glass of water . Are you alright , Ma ? Are you alright ? Ca n't you see ? There is n't anything I can do about it . But Johnny , you 're not trying to do a thing . Why do n't you talk to the lawyer ? - I have n't anything to say to him . - Johnny , you 're shielding someone . - You 're crazy . - I ca n't understand it . Did you do
zone1	n't pay for it , did it ? I 'll take it back . - I 'm sorry about that . - It does n't matter . Sitting on top of the world ... It sounds sort of foolish now , does n't it ? Johnny , I do n't believe you did it ! I wo n't believe it ! They caught me with the goods . There 's no doubt about that . Of course , it would n't have been so bad , only they took the car and do n't belong to me . Fine chance I 'd have with that company now . Or any other company . Listen . Do n't you gamble your future on me . Do n't wait . There 're plenty of other boys in this town with good jobs . They could be crazy about you . I do n't want you to come here again . I do n't want to see you . Johnny . Johnny . Good morning , Pa . Well , they 've done it . They 've convicted him . Three years ,
zone1	We 've got to do something . We 've got to ! We ca n't do anything now . Johnny should have thought of that before he comitted the crime . - We 've got to help him . - He never listened to me . I could n't tell him anything . I always say : " As ye sow , so shall ye reap " . You can keep them old bars . I do n't want them where I 'm going . You keep them old dice too . You all ai n't got enough juice around here . Where they 're gon na take me , they 're gon na make some electricity experiments on me . Hi , young fellow , let 's go . I 'll stay with Ma Shelby . Can I talk to my boy ? Just for a minute . Make it snappy . Johnny . Johnny . Pa , pull yourself together . You ca n't go on like this . I 've got to , it 's killing me . I ca n't eat , I ca n't sleep
zone1	blame for me . - I 'm gon na tell the truth . - Pa , you promised ! You 've got to think of Ma , and the other kids . Come on , Pa . Cheer up ! This little time I 'll be away wo n't mean a thing . I 'll be back before you know it . Johnny . Pa , does the noise of the machine bother you ? No , Ma ... no . Isabelle ! Isabelle ! Here I am . You had a nice , long sleep . Where is Ma ? She 's gone to visit Johnny . She should be back soon . I 've heard the train coming just a little while ago . Isabelle , you do n't believe Johnny is guilty , do you ? I know he is n't . You 'll always love him , stand by him , wo n't you ? Always . Isabelle , tell Ma ... When she comes ... I want to see her . Something I 've ... got to tell her . Yes , dear . I
zone1	'll be hungry . You 're alright . Ma Shelby , you must have walked very fast . Isabelle , I have so much to tell you . - How is Johnny ? - Honestly , that boy gets better looking everytime I see him . Did he ask you about me ? Well , now , let me see ... - I think he said something ... - Ma Shelby , tell me . He sends you ... - How is Pa ? - He had a long rest . He 's asked about you several times . He wants to see you . And I have so much to tell him all about Johnny . Pa ! Isabelle ! I manage to keep busy . Sometimes it 's awfully hard to realize that Pa 's gone . Poor Pa . The only luck he ever had ... was bad . He was so good and kind . If I had my life to live over , I 'd marry the same dear man . Of course you would . Ma , why do n't you go and live
zone1	? I could n't bring myself to give up the old home . I do n't mind working , I like it . Besides , it 's good for me . You 're swell . How is Isabelle ? That girl is prettier everyday I see her . Do you know she and her Ma beg me to come to live with them till you come home ? Why do n't you ? I could n't do that . As much as I love them ... - Johnny ? - The kid himself . - How did you get out so soon ? - Good behaviour . Why did n't you let me know ? I 'd have waited at jail all night . That 's just why I did n't let you know . Besides , I thought it would be kind of nice to surprise you . Where are you going , Ma ? I must tell Isabelle , she 'd never forgive me . Come here ! I telephoned her , she knows I 'm home . Let me set this pillow for you . Ma ,
zone1	- Can I get you another cup of coffee ? - I 'm full right up to here . I 've never eaten so much in my life . I was so hungry I thought I had hollow legs . Johnny , I have n't laughed so since ... That sounds sort of encouraging . Wait a minute , sweetheart . Here , take it easy . What 's the matter , honey ? Did I say something ? - Of course not , Johnny . - But you 're crying . I ca n't help it . I do n't know what 's the matter with me . Johnny , you have n't changed a bit . - No fooling ? - No fooling . You know , now stop me if I 'm wrong , but I 've got a hunch that you two are sort of glad to see me . Now once more . I must fix your room . Wait a minute , Ma . You ca n't run out on us like that . Can she , Isabelle ? - I should say not
zone1	. And you two must have a lot to talk about . Johnny , I left the rest of that apple pie in the cupboard . In case ! Really I ought to be going home . Isabelle , ca n't you stay all night ? Would your Ma care ? - I told her that I might . - Why do n't you say that in the first place ? - Do n't ask so many questions . - Come here . Now that 's all settled . I want you to listen to a little straight talk . Johnny , you home ! Listen , honey , I 've got some great plans . I 've been promised a job out in Seattle , and my railroad fare too . Looks like a great chance . It wo n't be any time at all before I 'll be able to send for you and Ma . - Johnny , why your mother ... - I know . That 's the tough part of it . I do n't know how to tell her . - Why ca n't
zone1	. Somewhere else , start over . When I got off the train and walked up the street , everybody looked the other way . Fellows I used to go to school with ducked in the stores , so they would n't have to meet me . And when I came to the gate , some kids hollered " Jailbird " . Johnny , you must n't go . Do n't you see ? I ca n't stay here . I 'm no millionaire . And my own family , think about . Ma 's getting old , Isaac . That 's the tough part of it . Of course , I have n't made things any too easy for her . You have n't made the things too easy for any of us . It 's been like a black cloud hanging over the whole family . I know that . As soon as I get out there , I 'll send money for her every month . I 'll send it to you , Isaac , so that you can see that she gets the things she needs
zone1	send the money . Answer the door for me , will you , honey ? No , you answer it yourself . My mother . The great event , it shall come to pass . - How do you do ? - Phyllis . Phyllis , darling , come here . Mother , this is Phyllis . How do you do ? - Is n't this a surprise ? - Yes . - Mother , take off your things . - You do . Come in here . Why did n't you let us know you were coming ? We 'd have met you at the train . Isaac thought it would be nice to surprise you . Isaac 's been so worried about me , he thought it 's best to close up the old home . What ? - He said it was so expensive . - Did he say that ? Well , it was awfully lonesome living there all alone . But he took all our furniture to his home to keep for us . Gosh , it 's good to see you , Ma .
zone1	have a home here with us just as long as you want it . Then , you go upstairs , to my place . All right . Goodbye . This is gon na be a full page ad for the world 's greatest washing machine . You know , the old method in contrast with the new . I never thought I 'd stoop to this kind of work . It costs money to live in New York . All right , you can rest now , Ma . Answer the phone , will you , Ma ? Hello ? Just a moment , I 'll see . - It 's for Phyllis . - Call her , will you , Ma ? She 's up in the roof with some girlfriends taking a sunbath . I 'll call her . She would n't allow me up there . She says I 'm too young . Phyllis ! Phyllis ! - What do you want ? - You 're wanted on the telephone . How did you know I was over there ? Thomas told me you were up here
zone1	. You do n't fool me , not for a minute . I 'm on to you . Why , Phyllis ... I would n't ... You think I 've done something wrong . Now , I suppose you think I 've done something I should n't do , do n't you ? Well , I have n't . I 'll show you where you get off . I wo n't be spied upon by you or anybody else . I wo n't stand for it . - You 're snooping , you 're always snooping . - No , Phyllis , I was n't . I know you want to cause trouble for me when you came here . - Well , you wo n't cause any more ! - Phyllis ! I do n't care if you are his mother . He 'll have to choose between you and me . If he wants you , all right , but he ca n't have us both . It 's all right , Thomas , I do n't mind at all . This is Phyllis 's home and she
zone1	was young I felt just the same as she . Relatives are a nuisance . I feel terrible about this , Ma . No , Thomas , do n't you worry at all . There 's so much work for me to do with Susan . And I know Susan and Ben are anxious for me to visit them . - But are you sure you 'll be all right ? - Of course I will , dear . - But she 's my mother , Ben . - I know , but we ca n't do it . Why do you think we moved to this little apartment ? ' Cos we had to . We 're losing money in the shop everyday . People are n't eating meat like they used to . Some of them go on a diet and do n't eat meat at all . If this keeps up , I 'll go broke . I 've already had to fire the delivery boy . - She 's willing to work . - She 's too old to deliver meat . Where am I if
zone1	an old woman like her . I like your Ma and I do n't wan na be mean about it , but we 've got to be sensible . Later on , if things break , business picks up , OK , gladly . - But ... where can she go , Ben ? - To Isaac 's . He 's got a big house , no trouble for him . Why should he pass the buck to us ? You let me handle it , I wo n't hurt her feelings . Give me that ! Pa , tell Isaac to give me the bike ! Junior ! Harry ! Pa ! Junior ! Now let her ride , let her ride .

He 's a long distance away , and it 's not so easy as it was . - Why is n't it ? - Because we 're in enemy territory now . What does " enemy territory " mean ? Well , it means that the Yankees have captured this land , and it does n't belong to us anymore . And every time that Daddy comes to see us , he has to cross through the enemy lines ... and that 's very dangerous . I ca n't understand it . I say my prayers every night ... and I say a special prayer for Daddy to come and see us ... but it does n't seem to do any good . So yesterday I started praying in the daytime too . I prayed twice yesterday , and I prayed three times today . I 'm sure it 'll work now , Mommy . Here comes Daddy ! It 's

Well , things are going along . - Will it last much longer ? - Mm , I hope not . - Do you have to work hard in the war ? - We all have to do our share . Every time I see you you 're always so tired . Well , I 'm not tired now . You 're giving me new strength . I miss you , Daddy . Do you miss me ? Indeed I do . You know when I miss you the most ? At twilight when you used to sing to me .

I 'd better get going while the coast is clear . I 've got to find out ... where Sheridan 's army 's camping and report to General Lee before nightfall . I 'm so worried about you on these scouting expeditions . If they catch you , you 'll be shot as a spy .

Uncle Billy , do you think the Yankees will find us in the secret room ? Do n't you be a-scared , child . There ai n't nothing to worry about . - There is somethin ' to worry about if you 's white . - What you mean ? They wo n't hurt us , ' cause we 's slaves . They 's fightin ' for us . But if you 's white and Southern , then you 's the enemy . Oh , do n't pay

And in a case like this , it really is n't a lie . If they should stop here and they ask you ... tell them I was here but I left an hour ago , and you saw me cross the river . Now be a brave little Confederate , darling . Do this for me . - Daddy . - Hmm ? - Would General Lee want me to tell that lie ? - Yes , dear
zone1	tell a whopper . They 's comin ' , Massa Cary ! Here , help me with this . Do n't be frightened . Act as though you did n't know they were here . All right , Massa Cary . Put that table back up against the wall . Remember now , act as though nothing had occurred . Dance or play or something . We will , Daddy . - What you all doin ' ? - You got your mouth organ ? - Yeah . - Well , get ready to use it . Sergeant , take your men and search that wood . Cary 's around here , and this time we 've got to get him . He 's given us the slip long enough . - Hurry now . Move fast . - Yes , sir . All right , men , let 's go . Well , that was quite a concert . And how is the littlest rebel of them all ? Fine , Yankee.Just fine . Do you mind if I warm my hands at your fire ? No , sir
zone1	, sir . Yes , sir . My daddy was here , but he left an hour ago . - Is that so ? - Yes , sir . He was here .. . but he left an hour ago , and I saw him cross the river . Well , now , that 's very interesting . I know another dance . Oh , yes , sir . She know a lot of dances . Now , dance for the gentlemen , honey child . What was your father doing here ? My mommy was very sick , and she kept asking for Daddy . So yesterday Uncle Billy brought him ... and this morning my mommy went away . - Is that true ? - Yes , sir . I 'm sorry . But my daddy says I must always think of it as beautiful . Your daddy 's right . You see , I have a little girl , too , just about your age ... and I 'd feel awful sorry if her mommy went away . - Has your little girl got a pony ?
zone1	eat and everything ? You had the table out in the center of the room , eh ? - No , sir . - No , sir . - What are those tracks ? - I made them with my foot . Is that a trapdoor in the ceiling there ? No , sir . There ai n't nothing up there . Nothing at all , sir . - You 've been lying to me . - No , sir , I haven't . - Your father 's here now ! - No , sir , he is n't ! - You know he is ! - He was here , but he left an hour ago . - I saw him cross the river . - You tell me the truth , or I 'll give you the worst-- Just a minute ! - Drop your pistol . Now , come down and keep your hands up . Back over against that door . Turn around and keep those hands up . Daddy . All right , you can drop them now , but no funny business . Oh
zone1	did I ? Yes , you did , darling . Daddy 's proud of you . I said just what you told me to . You were perfect , and I was only fooling about the whipping . I really was n't going to . Run outside , darling . Daddy 'll call you . Come on , Uncle Billy . Can you arrange so that my arrest wo n't frighten her ? - I 'll try . - Thanks . - Any papers on you ? - No , I 'm not scouting this trip , Colonel . I came home to bury my dead ... and take my little girl to Richmond , where my sister is . I see . Well , come on . Let 's get it over with . I 'm afraid I wo n't be able to- to bid my little girl good-bye . I understand . Will you tell her I 've gone back to General Lee ? I 'll return soon . - Yes , it would just about fit . - What ? - The Yankee uniform . - What
zone1	? - Well . I left a uniform there to be mended by the slaves . If you stole that uniform , I do n't know how I could stop you . - You mean-- If you were wearing a Union uniform ... and had a pass through the lines ... you 'd stand a mighty good chance of making Richmond . - Where would I get a pass ? - From me . I do n't think my country expects me to make war on babies . I do n't know what to say . Of course , you realize what it means if you 're caught in my uniform . Are n't you taking an awful chance yourself , Colonel ? War 's full of chances . I wo n't forget this . I hope you get through . - God bless you . - There 's just one thing I ask . In passing through our lines , whatever you see or hear , forget . My word of honor . Daddy , Daddy ! The soldiers are coming back ! Get out the back way .
zone1	is the Yankee man gon na be nice ? A man could n't be nicer than he 's been . You see , you 've made me think of my little girl . - I knew all the time you were n't gon na whip me . - Come on . We 've got to hurry . Good luck . You 're nice enough to be a Confederate . Good-bye , Uncle Billy . - Any sign of him ? - Not a thing , Colonel . Well , you men better come in and warm up . There 's a fire in here . Yes , sir . - No trace at all , eh ? - No . But I 'm sure he 's still around here . They buried his wife just an hour ago . Look ! There goes somebody . - A man and a child ? - Yes . They 're headed for the woods . That 's a slave and his pickaninny . They just left here . They 're all right . - Do you hear anything ? - Horses . Listen
zone1	the man give you a paper to show them , Daddy ? Yes , but the Yanks around here may recognize me . I do n't want to use the pass until we get out of this neighborhood . This is n't a good neighborhood anyway . No . Come on . - Halt ! - Whoa ! - Where are you going , sir ? - I 'm taking this child to her father just beyond our lines . Colonel Morrison sent me . Here 's a pass . Have you got a little girl , mister ? No , I 've got a boy . - Where 'd you come from ? - Cary 's plantation . Left there at noon . - Why are n't you using the main road ? - Full of artillery . How old is your little boy ? - Five . - Oh , I 'm six . - My boy 's bigger than you . - He is ? Yes . This looks all right , but I do n't know . We 've got special orders to be on the
zone1	n't you hear ? They caught him this morning . - They did ? - Yeah , Morrison 's men , at his own plantation . - What 's your regiment ? - 72nd Vermont . It 's all right then . You 'll find them camped just a mile below here . Go ahead . Thanks . Oh , Daddy , you told a fib . Well , this is war , honey . Why is n't it a sin to tell a fib in war ? I do n't know why it is n't a sin to do any of the things we do in war . What 's the 72nd Vermont ? Well , that 's a regiment of soldiers I have no intention of meeting . Halt ! Colonel Morrison asked me to take this child to Greensburg . - Here 's his pass . - Colonel Morrison ? - Yes . - Where was he ? Cary plantation , about 1 8 miles south of_here . - When did you leave there ? - Why-- We left there at 1 2:00 . - Why ,
zone1	, sir . I 'm six years old . Well , I guess you 're all right . Go ahead . Wait a minute ! I wan na see that kid ! - Whose child is this ? - Friend of Colonel Morrison's . - Ever see me before ? - No . Ya did n't , eh ? Do n't you remember the shoe polish ? - No ! - Well , I do . Her old man 's the most dangerous scout in the rebel army . This looks mighty funny to me . Go get ' em ! Hurry up ! Head ' em off ! Take the lower road ! Get under the seat quick , honey . Halt ! Keep your hands up . Are you armed ? - No . - Let 's see . All right , we 'll go back . Follow us . - Captain ? - Yes . - I 'm afraid I 've got to give you some bad news . - The appeal was denied , huh ? Every finding of the court-martial was upheld . - That
zone1	? The morning of the 27 th ... at dawn . Well , I still have six days . Any messages you want sent ? I 'll be glad to do anything I can , Captain . You 've been very kind ... especially so in getting Uncle Billy here to look after my little girl . - I appreciate that . - I wish there was something I could really do , Captain . That child has literally captured us all . - Colonel-- Yes , I know . I heard you . No chance at all , eh ? No . And is my little party set for the morning of the 27 th too ? I 'm sorry , Colonel . He 's innocent , Major . All he did was try to help a child . The evidence we could n't overcome , Colonel ... was the fact that you not only gave him a pass but that he was wearing your uniform . - I stole that uniform . - We could n't make them believe that . I had hoped we could . I
zone1	you want done . Thank you , Major . Well , it was a gamble , and we lost . I have no regrets . When I think of my own little baby , I 'd do the same thing over again . Why is a shoe called a shoe ? What ? I says , why is a shoe called a shoe ? What do you mean , why is a shoe called a shoe ? Well , the world is full of names . They could have picked out any other name . - Who could ? - Whoever did . - I do n't know who it was . - Man , what are you talkin ' about ? Why is a shoe called a shoe ? Massa Cary says that shows you got brains when you 're thinkin ' ' bout things . I spent all day yesterday thinkin ' , why is a horse called a horse ? Aw , shut your mouth , will you ? What time is it now , Uncle Billy ? I heard the town clock strike 3:00 a while
zone1	to hurry . Daddy always expects me at 3:30 . He says it makes his afternoon seem shorter . There . That 's done . Shall I brush your clothes now , honey child ? Yes , please . Do you think they 'll keep Daddy locked up in that place long , Uncle Billy ? No , ma'am . I 'm afraid they wo n't , honey . You 're afraid ? You do n't want my daddy-Oh , no , no , child . I expects they take him out pretty soon now . Last night when I said my prayers ... I asked God to let Daddy out of there ... and- and I asked him for a new dress too . Then I thought maybe that was too much to ask ... so I told God he did n't have to bother about the dress . - Was that right , Uncle Billy ? - Yes , that was right , honey . But if you want that dress ... I 'll kinda slip a little hint in my prayers tonight . Now , Uncle Billy
zone1	like you did yesterday , I 'll never take you again . No , ma'am , I wo n't . We 've got to smile , so Daddy will think we 're happy . I will , honey . You 'll see . You ready now ? Yes , all ready . James Henry , you wait here until we get back . Yes , sir . Did you like it , Daddy ? You have charge of Captain Cary 's little girl , have n't you ? Yes , sir . I is one of his slaves , sir . - I want to speak to you a moment . - Yes , sir . That was lovely , darling . Come on now , and tell me what you 've been doing . Oh , I sewed up a hole in my dress . Mrs . Robin let me sweep the stoop . - Why , you 're becoming a regular , little housewife . - Daddy ? - Hmm ? - When are they gon na let you out ? No , no . Come on now
zone1	, there 's a little girl lives across the street ... and she has a pony , and she let me ride on it . - That 's grand . - And she gave me some candy , and she 's a Yank . And she said she did n't care whether I was a rebel or not ... and I said I did n't care whether she was a Yank . Even if there is a war , she was awfully nice to me . - Daddy ? - Yes . When she was so nice , and Colonel Morrison 's so nice , and Mrs . Robin ... why do the rest of the people have to kill each other ? I do n't know , honey . We grown-ups have n't as much sense as you children . This is n't money enough , but it 's all I can spare . I 'll give you a letter to him . He may help you . I do n't know . Thank you , sir . Thank you . You 've got four days to try it
zone1	bless you . I 'll start right now , sir . - Daddy ? - Yes , dear . - I do n't want to leave . - Perhaps you 'd better . Tomorrow you can come again . You 're not leaving without saying good-bye to me , are you ? Oh , no . I was gon na kiss you good-bye . Then tomorrow when I come , I 'll do all the talking with you . Oh , you switch around , eh ? Well , Daddy said you tried to help us , so I make you my second daddy . Nothing so nice ever happened to me . We got ta hurry , missy . Good-bye , Yankee . Good-bye , rebel darling . Good-bye , Daddy . - God love you , honey . - I 'll come tomorrow . - All right , sweetheart . - Good-bye , Massa Cary . - Good-bye , Billy . - Good-bye , Colonel Morrison , sir . - Bye . - Good-bye , darling . - Good-bye . - Bye . Uncle Billy , is n't
zone1	? Honey , that soldier man give me some money . He 's gon na write me a letter to give to a judge up in Washington . He said there 's just one way ... but I do n't know if we got enough money to get there . Please , sir , how much is the railroad fare for a colored man to Washington ? Six dollars and 20 cents . And how much for the little girl , sir ? Ah , she 's a little too tall for half fare . Oh , no , I 'm not . I 'm standing on my toes . This is my right size . All right . It 'll be $9.60 for you , first class . Thank you , sir . - Have you got enough ? - No , child . It 's gon na take more money than what we got . How do people get money ? I know how to get some more money . Come on , honey child . Help the cause , white folks . It 's for the cause
zone1	Thank you . Thank you . I do n't put no money in the Confederate cap . There you are , boss . I brung this along just in case . - Oh , well , that's-- Thank you . Here , give me that . This makes 44 , 45 , 46 , 56 . Bless the Lord . Praise the Lord . We got enough now , honey , for railroad fare . Come on , child . - You may go in now . - Thank you , sir . Come on , Uncle Billy . Come right in . Miss Virginia Cary and Uncle Billy ? - Yes , sir . - Yes , sir , Mr . President . How do you do , my dear ? Very nicely . Thank you , sir . And how are you , Uncle Billy ? Let me see . Judge Van Allen told me about this case . Yes , sir . He 's the gentleman the soldier man sent me to . Come over here . Tell me all about it . There . Now ...
zone1	in prison ... and they 're going to shoot them . Your father is a captain in the Confederate Army . Yes , sir . Arrested as a spy . My daddy is n't a spy ! Do you know what a spy is ? I know it 's something bad , because they shoot you for it ... and my daddy could n't do anything bad . I do n't see how he could either ... with a little one like you . Thank you kindly , sir . Tell me about it . My daddy went away to the war ... and then the Yankees came around to our house ... and sometimes my daddy came home . - Was he in uniform ? - Yes , sir . - What color ? - Gray . I see . Thank you , sir . Then there were so many Yankees around ... my daddy could n't come home anymore . Then they burnt down our house , and my mommy got sick ... and had to go to bed in Uncle Billy 's cabin . No , that
zone1	's right . We had nothing to get her medicine with , Mr . President . The soldiers took most everything we had . And Mommy kept asking for my daddy . All the time she 'd ask . No , that 's mine . You had the last piece . - I beg your pardon . - You forgot . That 's all . So Uncle Billy went and brought my daddy back home . The next day , my mommy went away . There , there . Do n't cry . You 're a great big girl . You must n't cry . - I won't . - What happened next ? Then the Yankees came , and my daddy had to hide in the garret . Then Colonel Morrison came in . He talked to me . He 's awfully nice . He has a little girl , too , just my age . Then he found Daddy , and Daddy told him ... about wanting to take me to my Aunt Caroline in Richmond ... so I could get enough to eat . That 's why
zone1	so he could bring Miss Virgie where she could be taken care of . I see . Now , on this trip ... before your daddy was captured ... did he write down anything on paper or anything ? - No , sir . - Did he ever stop and look at the Yankee soldiers ... or count them or look at the cannons ? No , sir . He told me that if we got to Richmond ... and anyone asked me what I had seen ... I was in honor bound not to tell them . - He told you that ? - Yes , sir . Because Colonel Morrison asked him not to see anything ... and my daddy gave his word , and they shook hands . - John . - Yes , Mr . President ? - Mr . President ? - Yes , Miss Virgie . You wo n't let them shoot my daddy and Colonel Morrison , will you ? - Rush this by special courier to General Grant . - Yes , Mr . President . - Is this yours ? -

Number two-Falling from greater distance ... exhibit sunburst effect . But observe . Drop of blood thrown forward , as from knife held in hand ... make entirely different mark . Hey , fellas !

[Man_On_Radio] Gathered to witness the greatest sporting event of the Australian turf
zone1	the bugle , calling the aristocracy of turfdom onto the field . The entry list has never been equaled during all the years ... in which the cup has been this country 's greatest race . Number one , Gunsmith , two , Flying Scotchman , three , Stardust , four , Avalanche ... the great Australian four-year-old with [Tip] Collins in the saddle ... and owned by Mr . George [Chester] , the internationally-known sportsman from the U.S.A . Well , there 's justice for you . Your father gives four of the best years of his life to raising that animal ... and I grab all the honor . Do you regret your generous impulse , Major ? Oh , I was n't as generous as I was clever . This way I keep everything in the family . Truthfully , George , did you marry me for myself alone or for Dad 's horse ? - Why for the horse , of course . - Spoken like a gentleman . - As a friend , I 'd advise you to do something about that . - What
zone1	. - What ? Another racing man ? No , thank you . Dad , I barely got our bets down on time . Did you get the rest of my money placed , [Bruce] ? - Yes , sir . Just before the odds fell again . - Good work . - Will that be all , sir ? - That 'll be all until I collect . [Chuckles] If you collect . You seem pretty confident . - I am confident . - [Chuckles] Still think your husband 's entry will win , Mrs . [Chester] ? - I bet you a hundred he will . - I 'll take that bet . - How about another thousand , Denny ? - I 'll take that one too . ManOnP.A . The horses are reaching the starting gate . Gunsmith has the rail . [Man_On_Radio] Hello , hello , hello . One of them 's cutting up out there . - Are they off ? - It 's Avalanche . He 's certainly living up to his reputation as a bad actor . - Hold on there .
zone1	, cut it out ! - And it looks as if he 'll be off to a bad start . - Good-bye , shirttail . Now they 're getting in line . Avalanche has quieted down , and it looks like a start . It is a start ! And they 're off ! - [Crowd_Cheering] - [Announcer] It 's a beautiful start ! Go , Avalanche ! Come on , Avalanche ! Flying Scotchman takes the lead ! Gunsmith , a close second ! [Cheering_Continues] Avalanche coming up as they go into the first turn . Gunsmith closing behind Scotchman . Stardust , only a length away ! - Come on , Avalanche ! - Come on , Avalanche ! Ace is telling on Flying Scotchman , Stardust gaining ! - Come on , Avalanche ! - He 's gaining ! Flying Scotchman is failing ! Avalanche is coming up ! Come on , Collins ! Ride him ! Ride him ! Avalanche is neck and neck with Stardust ! Avalanche has taken the lead ! He 's cutting over on the rail ! - Avalanche fouled him .
zone1	insane . - He deliberately threw that race . Have that jockey report to the office . Shirttail now bobtail . Well , anyway , Pop , we were on the best horse . The cards were just against us . That 's all . When player can not see man who deal cards , much wiser to stay out of game . When he took the lead he fought for the rail . Avalanche does it almost every time . You trained the horse , Bagley . What about it ? He has a slight pull to the left , but Collins should 've been able to handle him . It was n't my fault , I tell you . Avalanche is good enough to win on his own . You fouled Stardust , and you did it purposely . - Why ? Who paid you to do it ? - [Tip] Nobody paid me ! Never mind , Major . That 's enough now . I did n't throw the race ! I would n't do that . You 're suspended from further racing for two years .
zone1	on you , Mr . [Chester] . We have no alternative but to disqualify Avalanche . Well , of all the feather-brained fools I ever saw , you 're it . A blind man could have seen you pull that foul . You said to foul him , and I did . I told you to make it look like an accident . Here are your tickets on Stardust . Hey , what is this ? I thought my cut was gon na be five grand . This stuff has to be split too many ways . That 's just fine . For a measly two grand I get ruled off the track ... and you stay here and stuff your own pockets . I 'm only following instructions . You 'll be taken care of . - I 'd better be . - You will . Now , get out of here and lay low . There 's a gambling ring back of this . I 'm going to get to the bottom of it ! Major , there 's nothing we can do about it . I lost
zone1	'll be other races this year . Avalanche will clean up a fortune . It 's more than a question of money . We 're taking our horse to America for the first time . How do you think this scandal will reflect on us personally ? We 've got to clear it up . - [Bruce] ! - Yes , sir ? [Bruce] , cable [Charlie] Chan . - Dad , please do n't get mixed up in this . - We 're already mixed up in it . Cable Mr . Chan all the details what 's happened . - Have him meet our boat when we dock at Honolulu . - [Bruce] Yes , sir . - Better luck next time , Bagley . - Oh , thanks . Of course , you may be right about the gambling ring . I 've been racing horses long enough to know about these things ... and I would n't press an investigation if I were you . Fenton 's right . You 're playing with dynamite when you start monkeying with those fellows . I could n't expect
zone1	. George , do n't let him start anything . He might make a bad situation worse . Now , you know your father . Tomorrow we 'll all be on the boat sailing for America . He 'll have plenty of time to cool off . Very odd circumstance . I do n't think there 's anything odd about it , [Charlie] . It 's just unfortunate that your friend met with this accident . Had cable from Major Kent asking me to investigate gambling ring . Accident seem most convenient . [Charlie] , you 've a very suspicious mind . Suspicion often father of truth . Well , at any rate , it 's in your lap . The Oceanic will be docking in a few minutes . You better go down there , see what you can find out . - Sorry about your friend , [Charlie] . - Thank you so much . [Woman_Singing] [Knocking] - Who is it ? - Steward , sir . [Ship_Whistle_Blows] - Were you going ashore , sir ? - No . You 've been cooped up here for 10 days
zone1	It 'll tone you up . - I 'm all right . Maybe you 'd like to see the doctor , sir ? I 'll get him for you . I do n't want a doctor . If I do , I 'll send for him . Right you are , sir . Marks of violence quite evident , Doctor ? The hoof prints are deeply indented in the skull . The body is still aboard , if you wish to examine it . - All in proper time . - [Ship_Whistle_Blows] So sorry . Not necessary for ladies to remain . You and Alice go to the cabin , hmm ? I 'll join you later . Please , ca n't we get this over with ? - You , uh , major 's secretary ? - I was . Yes . I 'm with Mr . [Chester] now . [Chuckles] Excuse , please . Uh , sometime memory very bad . Who you say find body ? I said it was Mr . Fenton 's stable boy . Thank you so much . You also have horse on
zone1	string of horses I bought in Australia . You intend racing same ? Yes , but I do n't see what that has to do with it . You say you talk with major ten minutes before death ? - Your memory 's improving , Mr . Chan . - Thank you so much . Ca n't we end this ? Dr . Johnson has made a thorough examination and said it was an accident . This unnecessary questioning is idiotic . Easy to criticize , more difficult to be correct . Will now inspect stall where major meet death . - Permission , please ? - Certainly , Mr . Chan . [Horse_Blusters] Very strange . Avalanche know major four years ... yet kick him to death . - Well , he has a bad temper . - Huh . Friendly now . You wanted to see my stable boy , did n't you ? - Please . - [Horse_Whinnies] Streamline . Streamline ! - Streamline ? - [Monkey_Chatters] Hey , you old Lollipop ! What you all doin ' ? Streamline ! Where are you ? Here I
zone1	. - Yes , sir . Quit that . What 's the matter with you ? [Monkey_Chatters] Now you all stay up there where you belong and mascot with Gallant Lad . - Yes , sir ? - This gentleman wants to ask you about the accident . He 's a detective . Is you a cop ? My , oh , my ! You remember position of body in stall ? That 's just what I 'm trying to forget . This is stall where honorable major meet death ? Oh , no , sir . It happened over yonder . Yes , after the accident , we moved Avalanche to another stall . Please . Where is Mr . Streamline ? [Groans] Yes , sir ? Here I is . Where was body ? Body ? Back yonder aging the wall lying on his face . Uh , will , uh , kindly take same position on floor ? I was just-Who ? Me ? No , do as he says now . Would greatly appreciate cooperation . Me on floor ? Could I fix him up a
zone1	- Do as he tells you ! - Yes , sir . Somethin ' gon na happen to me , I know . Ai n't no good come from playing dead on the floor . Thank you so much . Please to stay . Yes , sir . Horse in stall always face forward like others ? Yes . Narrow width make impossible to turn around ? That 's rather obvious , is n't it ? Then , Avalanche could only kick backward . That 's the way a horse always kicks . Thank you . - Something very strange here . - You mean me ? Now , what 's strange , Mr . Chan ? Animal kick backward , body lie there ... yet bloodstains found here . Observe , please . Shape like exclamation marks lying down ... with pointed ends toward rear of stall . Is there anything unusual about that ? Yes , very poor attempt at deception . - May borrow fountain pen ? - Certainly . Thank you . [Chatters] - [Chattering_Continues] - [Avalanche_Whinnies] Will now demonstrate only manner in which bloodstains could
zone1	, what does that get you , Mr . Chan ? Idea that maybe someone stand here ... and while major pet Avalanche ... murderer crush skull with heavy weapon ... then drag body to back of stall to put blame on noble animal . This is fantastic and absurd ! There was blood on the horse 's hoofs and my examination indicated the man was- [Screeching] Why , that 's Avalanche ! [Screeching_Continues] - [Whinnies] - It 's that confounded monkey ! Get him off there ! Streamline ! Yes , sir ! Get that monkey down from there before I throw him overboard ! Come here , you Lollipop . [Horse_Whinnies] Do n't you all know better than to pester with Avalanche ? - Have n't I told you to keep that monkey away from Avalanche ? - It 's all right . I 'll give instructions that he be kept tied up for the rest of the voyage . I 'm sorry about this interruption , Mr . Chan ... but you see , Lollipop was brought up with Gallant Lad . And when I bought the
zone1	too . Perhaps he senses our rivalry , George . There 's your answer . That 's what happened . Major Kent was in the stall , and the monkey frightened Avalanche ... and he kicked the major to death before he could get out . Very excellent analysis . Why , the whole thing is preposterous ! I ca n't have my ship held here for investigation . That runs into thousands of dollars . [Charlie] is usually right when he has a hunch . Have more than hunch . - Now , look here , Mr . Chan-- Excuse , please . Took liberty of borrowing small piece from boat . - [Clanks] - Well , what 's that ? Why , it 's a part of the clutch control of the winch ! Yes , uh , twin to one missing from cargo deck outside horse stalls . Observe . Shape identical with horseshoe blows which crush skull of Major Kent . Very excellent proof of murder . That means the investigation will have to continue , [Captain] . But ca n't Mr . Chan go with
zone1	about it , [Charlie] ? Do you want a sea voyage ? - Sea voyage good for health . - [Chuckles] Boat sail at 6:00 ? Your cabin 'll be ready . I 'll pack our bags before you can say , " Jack Robinson , " Pop . Uh , correction , please . You pack my bag . - You stay home with Jack Robinson . - Aw , gee , Pop . [Chuckles] Aloha and good luck . Thank you so much . See you later . - [Band] - [Chattering] Here you are , Mr . Chan . 212 . B Deck . - Thank you so much . - Yes , Father . Hello , Mr . Chan . Well , Mr . Chan , we 've been looking for you . I 'm afraid we treated you rather badly this afternoon . I - I owe you an apology , sir . All forgotten- like last year 's bird 's nest . [Chuckles] Does it occur to you the guilty person may have left ship ? Uh , check on passengers at gangplank reveal
zone1	person we bump into may be the murderer ... - sort of gives a fellow the creeps . - [Chuckles] What 'll be your next move , Mr . Chan ? Make effort to catch murderer . - For you , sir . - Well . Will you pardon me ? Listen to this ! " Do n't enter Avalanche in the Santa Juanita Handicap . A dead horse ca n't win a race . " - May I see that ? - Where 'd you get this , [Bruce] ? What ? Oh , at the- at the desk . Time of delivery stamped on back of envelope ? Yes , it seems to be blurred . Four minutes past 6:00 . That 's only 10 minutes ago . - Uh , may examine , please ? - First they get the major . Now they 're trying to scare me . Look here , George . Whoever wrote this means business ... and Avalanche is too fine a horse to lose through your stubbornness . I 'll give you 20,000 for him and retire him for a year
zone1	that the major was right . I 'm going to see it through to the finish . I 'll talk to [Captain] Blake and insist on an extra guard below . Most excellent precaution . Oh . So sorry . May have letter , please ? - Certainly . - Thank you so much . [Ship's_Whistle_Blows] Oh , gee , Pop . How 'd you know it was me ? Frequent spanking when young make rear view very familiar . Why you here ? Well , after you left , Mom decided to take the kids to visit Aunt Ling ... at the other end of the island , and I thought-Uh , you make suggestion about visit ? I - I sort of mentioned it . But , uh-Cabin boy outfit- disguise ? Oh , no , Pop . This is on the level . I signed for the trip . Now look , Pop , if a gambling ring 's back of this , it 's dangerous ... and , well , gee , I 'd feel terrible if anything happened to you ... and I was n't
zone1	man is poor who have worthy son . " Thank you so much . Then you 'll let me help ? Examine , please . [Whistles] Say ! The top edge is uneven , like it had been cut off with scissors . Yes . Writer take precaution to eliminate Oceanic trademark ... but forget watermark in paper . They 're the same , all right . Then whoever wrote this is on the boat . And look , Pop . The E 's are clogged up , and the R 's a little above the line . That means if we can find the machine this was written on , we 'll have our man . Why , it 's a cinch ! I can search all the cabins . One moment , please . Search only in pursuit of duty as cabin boy . Must remember obligation to ship . Okay , Pop . I 'll clean every room on the boat if I have to . One thing more . As , uh , humble cabin boy , must forget , " Okay , Pop . "
zone1	a secretary . I 'm gon na bet every dollar I have on Avalanche . - Then we 'll get married and-- [Bruce] , please . That is n't the kind of marriage I want . I 'd always hoped the man I 'd marry would stay away from racing and betting . - Why , Alice , I never thought that you-- Do n't you see , darling ? That 's the sort of thing I 've had all my life . Dad and I never had a real home . It was always just one track after another . But the thrill of racing- the gamble and then winning . And losing . We never felt sure of anything . One minute Dad would be on top of the world ... and the next , we 'd have to borrow money to pay the feed bill . [Bruce] , dear , I 'd hate to go through that with you . All right , dear . Santa Juanita will be the last time . I promise . Beg pardon , sir . The gentleman in 219 wishes to
zone1	me , darling . I 'll see you in the lounge . [Locking_Door] - [With_Accent] Oh ! So " solly . " - Hear , hear . Not so fast . - You 're a new boy , are n't you ? - New now . " Velly " soon old . Ah , smart , eh ? You do n't belong up here . - And what were you doing in that cabin ? - Finish downstair . Think " velly " smart work hard . By and by " catchee " more money . Yeah ? You 'll catch more than that if I find you up here again . Now , scat ! Scat chop-chop . Typing , Faint - What are you doing here ? - Oh ! Oh . [With_Accent] Excuse , please . Write letter to girlfriend . Hereafter , write your letters somewhere else . So " solly " you mad . Clean up now , chop-chop . So " solly . " So " solly . " So " solly . " - Oh , so " solly . " - Oh
zone1	you to stay off this deck . Oh , tell him I went bottom side , Pop . I 'm awfully sorry , sir . Did I hurt you ? [Sighs] Stoop to pick up pin . Bring good luck . Good luck to that moon-faced cabin boy . He 's a very suspicious character , he is . And as soon as I get me hands on him , into the brig he goes . Did you notice which way he went , sir ? Uh , make hasty exit to north . Right you are , sir . I 'll get him . Psst ! Pop ! I found the typewriter all right . It belongs to Mr . Fenton . See ? The letters are exactly the same . Most excellent progress . Well , I guess that 's that . All we 've got to do now is arrest him . Hasty conclusion like toy balloon- Easy blow up , easy pop . Do n't you think Fenton did it ? You find way to typing machine . Maybe someone else do same . Gee ,
zone1	gon na do now , Pop ? Surprise attack often find enemy unprepared . That extra guard ought to be on duty by now . I 'll step down and check . - I wish you wouldn't . - Now , dear , will you please stop worrying ? I 've done nothing but worry , George , ever since you received that note . - I told you not to say anything about it . - I know . I know . You stay here with Warren . I 'll be gone only a few minutes . Ca n't you persuade him to sell Avalanche to you ? Try and make him do it . Any progress ? Long road sometime shortest way to end of journey . - Uh , may borrow cigarette , please ? - Yes , certainly . This was n't in my pocket when we left the dining room . It 's another one of those notes . " A dead horse is n't worth $20,000 . " What does it all mean ? It means that someone knows an awful lot about our
zone1	course . Thank you so much . Will make immediate investigation . Did you notice the way he looked at me ? Do you think he could have put that in your pocket ? No , he was n't within a yard of me . The best place for you is in your stateroom . I 'm going down to the stalls and see George right away . [Coughs] - Left at the post ? - [Bruce] 'll be back in a minute . - Alone at last . - Now , Denny , do n't tell me I 'm the only girl you ever loved . If [Bruce] does n't marry you pretty soon , I will tell you . - What 's holding things up ? - Money . He 's so noble . He insists upon waiting ... until he can support me in the manner to which I 've been accustomed . - Very foolish young man . - You mean [Bruce] ? Foolish to seek fortune when real treasure hiding under nose . [Laughs] Will you tell him that for me ? Will be most
zone1	to let a pal down ... you tell [Bruce] to consult me hereafter before he bets on a horse . [Chuckles] Oh , wo n't you sit down , Mr . Chan ? Thank you so much . The same in these , and make mine Scotch . - Yes , sir . - What will you have ? - Uh , sarsaparilla . - Sarsaparilla , sir ? - Please . - Very good , sir . That 's dissipation for you . You are lucky at , uh , horse betting ? I 'll say he is . With all the odds against him ... he bet on Stardust at the Melbourne Cup . - I have good hunches sometimes . - Play hunch on Stardust ? I suppose you could call it that . Look , Mr . Chan . Just as I was coming up the stairs , this fell at my feet . " It 's dangerous to know too much about other people 's business . " - [Bruce] . - Do n't get the jitters . That sounds like the one George received
zone1	[Bruce] told me about it . Well , what do you make of it , Mr . Chan ? Make conclusion you talk too much . - Well , this is for you , Mr . Barton . - Hmm ? How it came to be on my tray I do n't know . It was not there when I left the bar . Well , I got one too . - They certainly are n't playing any favorites . - [Opens_Envelope] " A smart gambler knows a dead horse ca n't win . " Very interesting . May keep , please ? Will make immediate investigation . I 'd like to do a little investigating on my own hook , if you do n't mind . Cooperation greatly appreciated . Excuse , please . Well , hello , Mr . Chan . Well , this seems to be for me . Yes . " Withdraw Avalanche from the Santa Juanita Handicap . This is your last warning . " - Your secretary and Mr . Barton also receive mysterious notes . - What ? Uh , writer seem very
zone1	to say ? Why do n't you do something about it ? Rabbit run very fast , but sometime turtle win race . Well , they 're after you too . [Chester] What does it say ? Most distressing . Must give immediate attention . Excuse , please . Come back here , you !
zone1	door_opens , Closes Gee , Pop . That steward nearly grabbed me dropping that last note to Mr . [Chester] . Congratulations for most expert delivery of mysterious letters . Did your scheme work all right ? Did you find anything ? Experiment result in most interesting discovery . [Ship_Whistle_Blows] [Man] Trouble in the forward hold ! The forwards stalls . That 's where Avalanche is . Come on , Pop . One moment , please . You remain here . - [Whinnying] - Come on . Get these horses out of here . [All_Shouting] [Shouting_Continues] [Whinnying] - What started this , [Captain] ? - I 'm sure I do n't know , but it 's under control . It 's okay . It 's a lucky thing the fire was discovered in time .
zone1	... - just to carry out a threat against a horse . - Contradiction , please . Person who start fire intend no harm to noble animal . How do you figure that out ? Fire made directly under automatic apparatus ... so heat will set off alarm more quickly before much damage . Their way of letting me know that they could have killed Avalanche if they 'd wanted to . - Where was the extra guard when this happened ? - He was on duty . - May , uh , question him ? - Smithers ! - Yes , sir ? - You were where when alarm sounded ? On the cargo deck , sir . You had instructions to stay in here . Why did you leave ? One of the booms was squeaking , sir , and made Avalanche nervous . When Mr . [Chester] came down , he spoke to Mr . Bagley about it ... - and he told me to fix it . - That 's right . [Captain] Smithers . You also on cargo deck ? No . After Mr .
zone1	long there before alarm ? About 10 minutes , maybe 15 . I do n't know exactly . - Horses alone then ? - Streamline was here . I told him to keep an eye on them till Smithers got back . Mr . Streamline ? Yes , sir ? - Yes , sir ? - You were present when alarm sounded ? Yes , sir , but- but I was asleep , sir . You see , sir , I took me a drink of gin for the misery in my feet ... and , naturally , I go to sleep when I take a drink of gin . I ought to discharge you ! Next move may be more than warning . - Extreme precaution now necessary . - You 're absolutely right . - From now on , you sleep here , Bagley . You understand ? - That 's a good idea , I guess . - You have your gun with you ? - It 's in my room . [Chester] Well , what good is it doing there ? I thought with this going
zone1	it . I thought with this going on , something might happen , so I was cleaning it . It 's on my table , Streamline . Get it for me , will you ? - It ai n't loaded , is it ? - Of course not . And bring the cartridges . Yes , sir . Excuse , please . What did you find , Mr . Chan ? Ghost of matches . Here are the gun and bullets , Mr . [Chester] . If you ever take another drink on duty , you 're [Man] What happened ? - Mr . Chan ! - What happened , [Captain] ? - Get a doctor . Hurry ! - [Sailor] Yes , sir . - I 'm sorry , Mr . Chan . I do n't know what to say . Happy bullet in leg rather than heart . Thank you so much . I thought you were cleaning the gun . You said it was n't loaded . It was n't when I left my room . - Ten minutes so far . - Hmm . [Knocking] You
zone1	May enter . Hello . I hear you ran into a bullet . Contradiction , please . Bullet ran into me . [Chuckles] I 'm so sorry . Really , I am . Sympathy reason for visit ? And to return the mysterious little note that you sent me . Clever idea , Mr . Chan . My compliments . Pleasure to return compliment . Clever deduction . Good . And now that you 've admitted my ability as a detective ... why not let me in on the secret ? - Whom did you expect to catch ? - Maybe you have answer . I wish I had . I liked the old major a great deal . [Nervous_Chuckle] If I can be of any service , just , uh , give me a buzz . - Thank you so much . - [Door_Closes] Do you think he did it , Pop ? Ocean have many fish . There it goes . [Man] who set fire have 12 minutes to cover trail . That 's right . Now look , Pop ... Bagley said he was in his room
zone1	have done it , and so could Mr . [Chester] ... because he was there while the guard was outside . But wait a minute ! It might have been that secretary of his too . Because when I dropped his note , he was coming up from the cargo deck . You know ... I still think that Fenton 's the guy we want . I could have sworn someone was at that window . [Lee] , come back . Gee , Pop , what are you always stopping me for ? Why do n't you give me a chance to clean this case up ? Foolish rooster who stick head in lawn mower end in stew . Look at you , laid up for the rest of the trip with a bullet in your leg . I 'm not gon na let them get away with that . I 'm gon na find the guy that loaded that gun ! Oh , so it 's you , eh ? What 's he doing here , sir ? Is he annoying you ? - Very desperate character . -
zone1	? [Both_Speaking_Chinese] Confine to brig , please . Eagle eye for rest of voyage bring reward . Right you are , sir . I 'll stick to him like Scotch glue . [Chinese] - [Sighs] - [Door_Closes] Thank you so much . [Ship's_Horn_Sounding] Move in there and get a close-up . A little closer , Mr . Bagley . Mind keeping his head up ? Thanks a lot . All right , hold it . - Thanks a lot , Mr . [Chester] . Thanks , Mr . Chan . - Okay . - Hello , Mr . [Chester] . - Hello , boy . How are you ? - Feeling pretty fine , sir . My leg 's almost as good as new . - Well , I 'm glad to hear it . Say , I 'm sorry you lost that race in Melbourne . I 'll bet it never would have happened if I 'd been riding him . That 's all part of the game , boy . Oh , I 'm sorry . This is Eddie Brill , the boy that used to ride for
zone1	. Chan . - Oh , I 've heard a lot about you , Mr . Chan . So pleased . What about these threats you received on the boat , Mr . [Chester] ? Avalanche will be under guard day and night , and no one else will be allowed near him . And I promise you that he will run in the handicap , wo n't you , boy ? - All right . Take him out to the trailer , Bagley . - How about you , Mr . Fenton ? Any of those new horses you bought over there show any promise ? Yes , Gallant Lad . I plan on entering him in the handicap Saturday . Well , what do you think of his chances ? Well , until the winner crosses the finish line ... it 's anybody 's money , is n't that right , [Chester] ? - That 's what makes horse racing . - [Animal_Screeching] - [Horse_Stomping] - [Man] Get down from there ! - Whoa ! Whoa , Gallant Lad ! - [Monkey_Screeching] Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa !
zone1	Lollipop ! Where you all goin ' ? - Confound that monkey ! Streamline ! - Yes , sir ? Get that monkey down from there before he gets Avalanche crazy too . Here , Mr . Fenton . - Hurry up . Get him off of there . - Yes , sir . Behave yourself . You 're the " fickliest " fool I ever did see . Why do n't you like your friend Gallant Lad no more ? Come on . Get going . Get out of here . Something very strange . What , Pop ? Before fire , monkey dislike Avalanche . Now dislike Gallant Lad . Say , that is funny . Not if horses switched . By golly , I bet that 's it . They could get away with it too . The horses look enough alike , and they 're the same build . What you gon na do ? Go to hotel , take nap . Hiya , Bagley . I thought you were in Australia . - Yeah , I know you did . What 's the new racket
zone1	That horse you just put in the trailer ai n't Avalanche . That 's Gallant Lad . - Aw , you 're crazy . - Yeah ? You can fool [Chester] . He 's half blind anyway . But I ai n't . That fire was started on the boat to cover the switch . Not so loud . What 's the idea puttin ' an unknown palooka in Avalanche 's place ? - I ca n't answer that here . - Okay , where ? Come along with me . We could n't make a dime betting on Avalanche . He 's the favorite . The best we could get is even money . Sure , and nobody 's seen Avalanche in America . On the boat , the switch is made , and now Avalanche , in disguise ... goes to the post a horse no one ever heard of . Comes in a long shot with big odds . Catch on ? We 're plastering the country with bets from coast to coast at 20-to-1 , and we 'll clean up . Boy , that 's swell
zone1	. Aw , you 're already in . Well , boys , we 've got a lot of work to do . Lefty , take Collins and get him planted somewhere where he can hide out and get a good rest . Oh , sure . I know just the spot . - Have a drink ? - Never touch it . - Need any money ? - Well , yeah , I could use some . Took almost all I had gettin ' away from Melbourne . Well , here 's a couple of hundred for you . Thanks , Bagley . I guess I had you figured all wrong . - That 's all right . - Let 's go , Collins . So long , fellas . Good-bye , Collins . Observe anything unusual during night ? Not a thing . There 's no one around this track who does n't belong here . Avalanche is guarded so closely , no one could get within a mile of him . Innocent grass may conceal snake . Not when you go through it with a fine comb .
zone1	horse a workout first . Well , if I can be of any further service , Mr . Chan- [Chuckles] Grateful for all kindness , [Captain] Wade . That 's all right . 1:38 and four-fifths . Not bad . Well , he 'll have to do better than that if he 's going to beat my horse . Mr . [Chester] , they 're bringing Avalanche out now . Can I ride him ? - [Chester] I would n't take a chance , Eddie . - Aw , but I can handle him , sir . - Honest , I can . I 've been able to ride for months now . - Some other time . Whoa , Avalanche ! Whoa ! Steady , boy ! Steady ! [Man] Hold him ! Hold him ! What 's the matter with that horse ? What 's the matter with that boy ? Why does n't he pull him up ? - [Man] Look out . Look out . Be careful there . - Come on now , boy . Hold him up . They 're gettin ' him all
zone1	better go over there . Dad , our horse made better time than that yesterday . What do you suppose is wrong ? - I told the boy to hold him back . - What for ? [Chester] Because I do n't want to advertise what we 've got . The odds will go down . - That 's a secret . - Uh-oh . Oh . [Chuckles] Interesting contraption , is n't it , Mr . Chan ? Excuse ignorance . May inquire nature of strange device ? Oh , that 's part of the latest system for timing the races . Uh , may explain , please ? Well , there 's a lamp in here . This directs a beam of light across the track ... to that little box on the other side which contains a photoelectric cell . The moment a horse passes through this beam , the cell operates ... and a picture of the finish of the race is taken up there ... in the camera-eye booth . Is possible to see , please ? Certainly . Come right along . - Hello
zone1	minute ? I want you to meet Mr . Chan , Mr . [Charlie] Chan . - Oh , uh , glad to know you . - Thank you so much . Have you got time to explain the system , Al ? Mr . Chan is interested . Oh , sure , sure . Now to begin with , uh ... here 's the diagram of the track . At every quarter mile there 's a photoelectric cell . [Charlie] Mr . Barton already explained . - Shoot beam of light across track to time horses . - That 's right . - Say , Avalanche is just about to break . - Good . I 'll turn this on and show you how it works . Now , this light was automatically turned on when he went through the first beam . It also started the timer across the track . He 's coming to the first quarter . Now watch this light . - Twenty-three flat at the first quarter . - Avalanche is sure in form . Now , if you stand there beside the cameras
zone1	track ... you 'll see that they point directly over the finish line ready to take a picture . This switch turns on the high-speed movie cameras ... and we 're now ready to take a picture of the finish . Here he comes . He 's over . And now the film we just took is being developed in this high-speed developer . In less than two minutes ' time , Mr . Chan ... we have taken an actual picture of the finish and sent it down to the judges ' stand . That 's all there is to it . Perfection of mechanical brain make [Charlie] Chan very humble . Thank you so much . Avalanche appears strangely excited . Excuse , please . Pop , I 've got it . I 've got it ! One moment , please . You disobey instructions to remain here in room . I was n't helping any by staying here , so-So you visit racetrack stables . Gee , Pop , how 'd you know ? Hay do not grow in hotel . [Man] who flirt with dynamite sometime
zone1	na let you take all the chances . Look , I got in the stable , and when the guard stepped outside for a smoke ... I took some pieces of cotton and some cleaning solution too . Reveal black dye on forehead of Gallant Lad ... and then white dye on forehead of Avalanche ? Yeah , and there 's the proof . But if they 've been switched , how did Gallant Lad ... come within one second of Avalanche 's fastest time this morning ? [Lee] There 's a screw loose somewhere . Maybe loose screw here in test tube . Did you find something , Pop ? Managed to secure foam from mouth of excited Avalanche ... after practice race this morning . Observe . Bubbles prove foam contain very powerful stimulant for heart . Today make masquerader run very fast to give appearance of champion . I 've got it , Pop . It 's [Chester] and Fenton in cahoot to cheat the public . Also possible gambling ring cahooting to cheat [Chester] and Fenton . Yeah , but Pop , what are we doing
zone1	's murderer . Roots of tree lead in many directions . Aw , gee , Pop , when are we gon na arrest somebody ? Are you all right , Pop ? Quite all right . Careful , now . [Man] with gun like lightning ... never strike twice in same place . It 's sure lucky that curtain went haywire . Correction , please . Use string . So . Arranged simple device to give warning . Observe . When window raised , string trips shade and releases same . - Safe now to sleep . - Sleep ? We 've got to do something to stop those birds . - Have idea to trap birds . - Okay , Pop . Let 's have it . In morning , you rent [Chinese] laundry wagon . Disguise self as [Chinese] laundry boy . Good night . [Door_Closes] [Shouting_In_Chinese] But that [Chinese] dick is wise to the whole thing . Oh , do n't get excited . I know every move Chan 's made since he left the track this afternoon . Suppose he phones the cops , tries to
zone1	too . The line to his room 's been tapped , and Joe 's listening to every call that goes in or out . Suppose you let me handle Chan . Did you get that timing head finished ? Yeah , and , boy , it works like a charm . Come on . I wan na show you . Now , just before the handicap , I replace the timing head at the three-quarter pole ... with this phony and load it with this . So if any other horse is ahead of Gallant Lad , we got nothing to worry about . All right , here we go . Lefty , you pull him through . That ought to stop him . Sure there wo n't be any slipup ? Nah , this is n't gon na be operated from any camera-eye booth . I 'm gon na handle it myself . Well , what 's happened , Mr . [Chester] ? Another threat left at my hotel . Listen . " This is your last chance . Withdraw Avalanche before it 's too late . " Lansing
zone1	my horse in this race ... - and I demand protection for him . - And he 'll get it . The Association has something at stake too- the confidence of 80,000 people out there ... who depend on us to protect them from racketeers . Wade , get hold of every available man . Station them around the track and near the stables . - Detail two to guard Mr . [Chester] . - Yes , sir . - Mr . Chan been around ? - I have n't seen him . - Phone him . Tell him to get here fast as he can . - Yes , sir . Let 's go to the stables . Have assurance of immediate departure . Thank you so much . How do I look , Pop ? What 's the matter ? Something happened ? Mr . [Chester] receive another threatening letter . I 've been thinking this over , Pop , and I 'll bet you that Barton guy-Useless talk like boat without oar . Get no place . - Have firecrackers ? - Oh , you 'll be
zone1	surprise . Come quick . Keep moving and not a word out of either one of you . Get going . Philadelphia can handle two grand on Gallant Lad at 18-to-1 . - Take it . - Place two grand . Hello , Chicago . What are the odds on Gallant Lad ? Let me know when they 're 20-to-1 . San Francisco reporting Gallant Lad at 20-to-1 . - Grab it . - Place 10 grand . Hello , Cincinnati , how much can you handle ? Five grand . Oh , so you got him , huh ? - What 'll we do with him ? - In there . We 'll take care of him later . Come on . Better put ' em in there . I 'll take care of_'em . Clever [Chinese] , huh ? Stuck your snoot in the wrong racket this time , did n't you ? [Speaking_Chinese] - Hey , what 'd he say ? - He say you 're right . Sit down . Chuck , turn on the radio . [Announcer] Here 's a news flash that has already

If I put one of the other boys on Gallant Lad , will you ride Avalanche ? - No , thanks . - That 's very decent of you , Warren . - Oh , forget it . - I just

[Cheering] [Announcer] Elsie [Lee] is crowding him close to the rail . Avalanche
zone1	for which this boy is noted . Richardson on Golden Fleece is using his whip . He 's set the pace , but the stamina of his horse ... is not equal to the terrific speed that Avalanche shows at the half . Golden Fleece and Avalanche are out together with Golden Fleece tiring . Avalanche is holding his own with that reserve for which he 's famous . Avalanche is forging ahead . He 's every bit the horse they promised us-a real favorite . Avalanche moves into the lead . Nothing can stop him now . It looks as if he 'll establish a track record for the distance . We could n't believe this horse Avalanche was as good as they promised , but he is . He 's better . Avalanche is now a length in front . He 's got the race in the bag . There 's no doubt about it , ladies and gentlemen . The favorite is still favored . At the three-quarter- Something 's happened ! He 's lost his stride . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . He
zone1	one horse after another . He 's almost the real defender again . He 's passed Shrapnel . He 's passing Hold Away . He 's taking the measure of Golden Fleece . He 's still got a chance . You 've never seen a race like this before . This is the wonder horse of the age , the king of the turf . Here he comes . He 's a horse in 10 million . Avalanche is giving everything he 's got . He 's back with the leaders again . Golden Fleece falters . Avalanche is at his quarters . He 's even . They 're fighting it out neck and neck . Here they come- two magnificent animals tearing out their hearts in one last terrific struggle . There 's hardly an inch between them as they shoot down the stretch . This is a finish that 's going down in history . I 've never seen another like it . The final 50 yards . Avalanche literally hurls himself across the finish line . He 's over ! Avalanche wins ! - [Crowd_Clamoring] - He
zone1	! [Announcer] Clear the track , everybody ! Everybody off the track ! Come on , Meers . Cough it up . Who 's the ringleader ? Who 's been givin ' you orders ? - Nobody 's been giving us orders . - You 're lyin ' . Look here , I 'll talk to the D.A . We 'll make it easy on you . That would n't do any good . They 'd get me just like they got [Tip] Collins . [Tip] Collins ? That 's the guy they fished out of the ocean at Santa Monica this morning ! - [Intercom_Buzzes] - Yes ? - [Man] The police are here now , sir . - You can let them come in . I 'll take ' em down to headquarters , Mr . Lansing . - Maybe we can get more out of_'em there . - Come on . Look here , Lansing . I object to being held here like this for no apparent reason . We were rushed off the track so fast I did n't even have time to collect any of
zone1	? I 'm sorry , but this is at Mr . Chan 's request . - Then where is Mr . Chan ? - [Chuckles] Present . - Oh , Mr . Chan . - Thank you . Uh , happy to report Avalanche and jockey ... as son [Lee] would say , hunky-dory . Uh , please to sit down . Warren , did you know that up to 20 minutes before the race ... Avalanche was in your stall disguised as Gallant Lad ? What ? Why , such a thing is impossible . The switch was first made on the boat by Bagley . - Then why are we all herded up here like a lot of criminals ? - Mr . Chan will explain . Have here enlarged picture . Uh , show finish of race . Observe , please . [Charlie] Dart in shoulder of Avalanche . But where did it come from ? Who could have fired it with so many people around ? Explanation here in timing head . [Clicks] Also pleased to report ... person who fire same now in custody .
zone1	to do with it , Mr . Chan . Perhaps can help , uh , solving fresh mystery . Dart very evident here ... yet strangely absent one moment later ... when doctor examine Avalanche . All present were first to reach side of noble animal . Someone use cover of excitement to remove dart . - A polite way of telling us we 're going to be searched ? - Have objection ? Not the slightest . You wo n't find it on me , Mr . Chan . Please . Also . This is nonsense . Now wait a minute . Dad , please . We 've nothing to worry about . Here it is . - Dad ! - Someone put that in my pocket . I was n't within six feet of Avalanche . It was you . You were one of the first to reach him , because I remember-Just a minute , Fenton . I see this all very clearly now . You wanted to buy Avalanche all along . When I refused to sell , you stole him and substituted your horse .
zone1	offer to protect Avalanche . - The whole thing 's ridiculous . The whole thing is obvious . You 're the only one who would have profited by the exchange . With Avalanche running for you as a ringer at 20-to-1 , you 'd have cleaned up a fortune . I guess that settles it , Mr . Fenton . You 're under arrest . - How dare you say that about my father ! - I 'll say more than that . Your father murdered Major Kent who raised Avalanche ... because he would have seen through the switch at once . He had to be gotten out of the way , so you struck him down ... with a winch shoe to make it appear that Avalanche kicked him to death . - That 's a lie ! - Alice ! Pardon , please . How you know winch shoe kill honorable major ? - Why , everyone knew that . - Contradiction , please . Only three beside humble self knew name of death weapon . Honorable chief of police ... most honorable captain of boat ...
zone1	much . It 's all very amusing , but I think it 's carrying a joke a little too far . [Charlie] Cold-blooded murder no joke . You and Major Kent frequently quarreled because of your gambling losses . - Well , what of it ? - Fearing investigation of same ... would reveal self as head of gambling ring ... you kill honorable major on board ship . It is n't true ! My husband often quarreled with Dad , but he could n't have done such a thing . Truth sometimes like stab of cruel knife . You very clever but make mistake . On boat in Honolulu when you receive threatening letter ... have no difficulty reading same without glasses ... because contents familiar . But glasses necessary to read very legible ... time stamp on envelope . Suspected hoax then , so get corroboration later ... when you need glasses to read fake letter ... sent by humble self . Next mistake . When Avalanche received cruel dart ... you make haste to remove same ... fearing evidence point to self . Anticipating search on sudden
zone1	of Mr . Fenton . I think you 'll have a little difficulty in proving that idiotic story . Contradiction , please . Proof already in evidence . Blood of unfortunate Avalanche . Take away , please . So sorry . Mr . Chan , I have a confession to make . Have already arranged for you to make same to honorable stewards of track . - You knew ? - Too bad you did not expose plot ... when you first discover switch of horses . Temptation to cash in most unfortunate . Mr . Lansing , I will remove my stable from the track at once . I think that 's very wise . Wait for me , Dad . I just want to say good-bye to Mr . Chan . I do n't know how to thank you , Mr . Chan . You 've done so much for Dad . Uh , young man win money on race ? Enough to furnish a four-room flat , I guess . Good wife best household furniture . Hey , Pop , I 've got another hot clue .

Burn ' em ! - Go ! Grab ' em - - - [All_Shouting] Gentlemen , Mr . Erickson , the assistant secretary of war . Good morning , gentlemen . I suppose you
zone1	the trial of the conspirators ... in the assassination of our beloved president ... you have on your souls a grave responsibility . We realize it very deeply , Mr . Secretary . The object of this trial is not to determine the guilt or innocence ... of a handful of rebels ... but to save this country from further bloodshed . The solemn truth , gentlemen , is ... that the federal union is on the verge of hysteria . That is why the trial of these conspirators has been placed in your hands ... rather than in a civil court - - because men of the sword can be hard ... and hardness is all that can save this country from riots , mob rule ... even a resumption of the war itself . - Have you any suggestions , sir ? - Two , to help you to be hard . First , you must not allow your judgment and decision in this case ... to be troubled by any trifling technicalities of the law ... or any pedantic regard ... for the customary rules of evidence
zone1	allow yourself to be influenced ... by that obnoxious creation of legal nonsense - - reasonable doubt . [Crowd_Shouting] - Is that clear ? - Yes , it 's clear . Briefly ... the voice of this court has got to be the voice of the people . [Angry_Shouting] Before you start , I want you to hear that voice . Listen to it . [Angry_Shouting_Continues] [Chattering] Bring the prisoners . Prisoners to the bar . This court is now in session . - Mr . President . - TheJudge Advocate General . The death ofJohn Wilkes Booth ... who was shot down while resisting arrest in Virginia ... has left us eight members ... of his criminal band . So , in the name of the government of the United States ... the crime of assassination and conspiracy ... to assassinate Abraham Lincoln ... then-president of the United States ... is charged against the following : David E . Herold ... Lewis Payne ... George A . Atzerodt ... Michael O'Laughlin ... Edward Spangler ... Samuel Arnold ... Mrs . Mary E . Surratt - - [Gasps] , Whimpers
zone1	. Dr . Mudd ? I 'm General Ewing . With your permission , I should like to act as your counsel . Thank you , General . Thank you . We 'll fight together now , as we once fought each other . With the permission of the court ... we will begin the cases in order . We will start with the charge against George A . Atzerodt . Uh -- But is n't there any kind of news you can give us about - - about Dr . Mudd ? That 's all they 're gon na tell , lady - - just what you see on the board . That 's War Department 's orders . War Department 's orders ! Ha ! Did n't know they had one ! - Shh ! - Well , the dad-blamed -- Good night , [Sam] darling . The government will now present its case against Dr . Samuel A . Mudd . Tell them I 've got to speak . I 've got ta defend myself . I-- I ca n't let them treat me the way they
zone1	will instruct the defendant to remain silent and respect this court . I 'm confident , Mr . Erickson ... that after observing the conduct of these trials ... Dr . Mudd 's respect for this court ... is every whit as great as my own . [Man] Frank J . Thomas will take the stand . Tell the court what you know ... of Dr . Mudd 's loyalty to the federal union . Dr . Mudd was a dyed-in-the-wool slaver . Yes , sir ! Slaver ! Dr . Mudd 's name was on the prescription which I filled . Dr . Mudd served in the Confederate Army . Dr . Mudd denied that he 'd ever seen Booth . Dr . Mudd denied everything ... until I showed him Booth 's own boot right in his own home . Dr . Mudd , when I examined him in prison , confessed to me ... that he set Booth 's broken leg and then aided him with directions ... how to reach the Potomac and Virginia . - The case is ended . - No ! No !
zone1	defense you 're gon na hear whether you want it or not . - The prisoner will observe order . - Why ? Why ? What more could you do to me ? What threat have you got left ? You can hang me . You can hang us all - - the innocent as well as the guilty ! Because you - - you nine gallant officers and gentlemen - - have stripped yourselves of your pride and your honor . But I 'll not go without a fight . I 'll not go without trying to blacken your memories with the insane injustice ... you 'll carry on your souls till the day you die . ! And till the day you die , you 'll ask yourselves in your heart three questions : Does an assassin confide his plans to anyone ? Was I , a physician , in the plot ... because it was part ofJohn Wilkes Booth 's plan ... to break his leg and to need me ? Does a man , whose first devotion is no longer to a lost cause or to
zone1	his child ... risk any act that could only cause misery and heartbreak ... on their innocent lives ? In the sight of the holy God I worship , I 'm innocent . The court will ignore the remarks of the prisoner . Sergeant ! And -- And you still ca n't tell me what they 've decided ? Lady , I must have told you 40 times ... that I do n't know any more than them bulletins . He 's coming now . Oh , but , General , is n't - - is n't there any possible means ... of - - of stopping things , just for a little while anyway ? My child , I 'm using every legal means that I know of .

[All] the time , it 's coming towards you . Oh , but , darling , we have n't given up . We 're not through , not yet . No , Peggy , no . We 're not giving up - - you and [Martha] and me . But if Daddy has to stay away a little while longer . I want you to take care of Mama . You know ? Dry her tears , try to make her happy . Tell her , too , that in - - in the bottom drawer of the rolltop desk ... there are a lot of old bills - - bills that -- Well , Daddy never got around to collecting them .

Could n't hang you , eh ? Well , byJudas , you 're gon na wish they had fore I 'm through with you ! Take a look at him , you filthy rats ! Take a look at the man who killed Abe Lincoln ... the greatest man who ever lived . Look at him ! Watch
zone1	Left step ! [All] right . Drop your chains . Attention . Now , before we go any further here ... I want you to listen to me ... because I know exactly what you 're thinking ... every mother 's son of ya . You 're figuring on whether you 're gon na be able to break out of here . Well , we got a little way here of putting thoughts like that ... out of your heads . Follow me . You first , Doctor . Come on . Get up ! Halt ! Now , whenever you slops get to figuring ... on breaking out of here ... I just want you to give a little thought to this moat . It runs all around the island . It 's 7 5 feet wide ... and 35 feet deep . And you know what we keep in it ? We keep pets in it . Nice little pets . We got more pets in that moat than you can count . And sometimes we feed ' em . Not often . Oh , no . But
zone1	'm going to give ' em a little treat . Now watch close . ## [Whistling] [Buck] ! Move on , white man . - A prisoner , sir . - Just a minute . Now , you know , that 's quite interesting . Those are mosquito larvae . See there . But not very interesting to anyone but a medico , I 'm afraid . Well , I 'm also a physician , sir . No . Now I am pleased . That 's Dr . Mudd . Oh . Well , I - - I thought that -- I thought that , that as another physician , you would understand the circumstances - - the obligation of a doctor to - - to give aid to anyone , whoever he might be . Mr . Mudd ... if you assumed you might find sympathy here , get rid of the idea . The profession you have dishonored is ashamed of you ... ashamed of your membership in it . As a doctor , I may tell you that I despise you even beyond the rest of the
zone1	... to swear to you on the - - on the honor of the profession we both respect ... that I had nothing whatsoever to do with - - with the death of Mr . Lincoln ? It would be of no use whatever . I 'm sorry , sir . Bugle : Taps [Ends] [Buck] Marse [Sam] . ! Marse [Sam] . - Oh , [Buck] . - Marse [Sam] . I 's sorry , sir ... but I was too scared this afternoon . I could n't say nothin ' to you then . Oh , I knew . I knew that . Tell me , what are you doing down here ? - Oh , I 've been here a month waiting for you , sir . - You have ? Yes . You see , Mrs . Mudd , she told me to get on down this here man 's island . [Chuckling] So here I is - - done gone on down on it . Oh , you - - you 've given me the first hope I 've had since this - - since
zone1	so . But , uh , here 's some soap I brung you . - What ? Oh , yes . I guess I do need it . - Yes , sir . - But it 's for the mosquitoes . - Mosquitoes ? - Yes , sir . You put it on your face and hands . - Oh , I know . I know . Yes , sir , because there 's more mosquitoes on this here man 's island ... than I 've ever seen before . - I know . That 's why -- - Watch it . [Footsteps] My home , sir . Darling , General Ewing . How do you do , General ? This is Judge Maiben of the district superior court . Why , how do you do , Judge ? - How do you do , sir ? - The judge is a Yankee , but he 's honorable . - Thank you , [Colonel] . - He 's gon na get [Sam] out of jail . - But , Colonel-- [Colonel] , please -- - Wo n't you sit down
zone1	. Let me explain , General . At my request and for my own satisfaction ... Judge Maiben 's gone over the whole record of the case word by word . On the evidence produced , no civil court could hold Dr . Mudd for 1 0 minutes . You have some sort of plan , Judge ? The plan is , uh , Mrs . Mudd 's . No judge 'd dare devise anything quite so , uh , extreme . I explained toJudge Maiben what happened ... to the writ of habeas corpus you obtained for [Sam] . The government simply laughed at it . But ... if a writ was served on him in , say , Key West ... a civil municipality , it would be honored , would n't it ? Of course . But Dr . Mudd 's not in Key West . - I know he is n't ... yet . - What did I tell you ? But , great Scott , Mrs . Mudd , you surely would n't dare -- General Ewing , I 'd dare anything for my husband
zone1	him . It 's exoneration too . He 's innocent , and I want them to say so to the whole world . - But if we wait -- - Wait ? Wait for what ? For the government to kill my husband ? That 's all we 've done is wait and trust and have faith . Oh , I 'm so sick of waiting . I 've found a way to get [Sam] out . Just a moment , Mrs . Mudd . Now , all I have to say is this . If Dr . Mudd should be able to deliver himself to the civil authorities in Key West ... I could have a writ of habeas corpus there to be served on him . Now , under its protection , he could be brought back here . I 'd reopen the case , and I feel sure ... give him a far different trial than the one he had at the court-martial . But as to how Dr . Mudd ... is going to be able to get to Key West ... well , I think
zone1	dear , and remember ... I wo n't be the only Yankee who 'll be praying with you . - And do n't let anything disturb you . - I won't . - Good day , gentlemen . - Good day . We 'll sell , pawn , mortgage everything . We 'll get enough money . Oh . You understand what this means to me , do n't you ? It 's all that 's left of our lives - - [Sam] 's and [Martha] 's and mine . And it 's only your support - - your support behind us - - that we 're asking . You can leave the escape entirely to me , sir . Within 2 4 hours , I 'll have 5,000 of my old brigade under my command . We 'll seize a war vessel or two and blow the whole dad-blamed prison to ashes ... and deliver [Sam] in Key West with a guard of honor . I 'm sorry , Mrs . Mudd ... but if you 're set on such a foolhardy plan ... I must withdraw from the
zone1	's got to be free to be tried . - It 's the only way . Oh , do n't you see ? - I 'm sorry . - The risk is too great . - Igad , sir ! And if you 'll take my advice , you too will abandon this mad scheme . - What do you think ? - [Chuckles] Igad , sugar ... we 'll show these dad-blamed , chickenhearted Yankee lawyers ! [Groans] You leave it to me . I 'm gettin ' tired of this fiddling ' around , messin ' around . Lawyers ! Lawyers are no-good -- Oh . Yeah , lawyers are dad-blamed old women with their habeas corpus and all that . Lookee there . There . You see that ? StonewallJackson gave me that . Pure Toledo . And if I do n't get $1 50 for that ... I 'll have the pleasure of spitting the heart of the swine that dare offer me less . Open the door ! Marse [Sam] ! - Marse [Sam] ! - Yes , [Buck] ? Thanks . Thanks . Yes

But how about the moat and them sharks ? - I 'm gon na have to try the bridge . - But they got a guard on it . - Yeah , I know . - Watch it . - Marse [Sam] . - Yeah . - If I could go with you -- - Yes . I can arrange to be the guard that 's on the bridge . If you could arrange to be the guard on the bridge , we could both go together . - Now , listen . - Yes , sir . There 's gon na be a boat .

Relieve him . Place him under arrest and bring him here . - What 's up ? - Mudd 's out . Wait ! He 's out , but I do n't want him back alive . Do you understand ? Post extra guards to the bridge . Notify all sentries . We 'll see if we can give this Judas what the court-martial should 've given him . Tell them to shoot and shoot straight ! [Guard] , watch that -- No . Wait .

You 're under arrest . - But I just -- - Keep it to yourself . Move ! Take your post . [Whispering] [Buck] ! [Buck] ! [Yells] [Buck] !

[Gunfire_Continues] Keep firing ! He 'll never make it ! If we do n't get him , the sharks will . - What sharks ? - What sharks do you think , sir ? Sergeant , with that barrage on the water ... you 're lucky
zone1	yards of this spot . Stop firing , you fools ! You wan na drive those sharks away ? Keep your eyes open . ! [Man] I-I do n't see anything down here . Out yonder ! He 's outside ! [Gunfire_Continues] There 's a boat putting ' in toward him . Rankin , man two boats . I want that man back . Alive ! You understand ? Yes , sir . Boat crew number one !

You 're gon na have a new trial . And [Martha] 's waiting . - Where 's [Martha] ? - In Key West . She has n't ... forgotten me ? Oh , my sweet , not for one little minute .

[Sobbing] [Woman] And then the prince leaned down ... and kissed the sleeping beauty on both eyes - - smack , smack . - And what do you suppose happened ? - [Martha] What ? - [Woman] The sleeping beauty waked up . - Mama . ! Where 's Daddy ? Daddy ... could n't come , darling . He wanted to

I ai n't even heard no bugle calls . Ai n't even seen nobody . No food , no nothin ' . I guess everybody just done run on off and left us . Reckon it 'd do any good to holler again ? No , I hollered till I 'm hoarse . What you suppose happened ? I do n't know , [Buck] . Maybe - - Maybe just as you say -- That they have gone off and left us to die maybe . Tell the captain of that ship I 've got to have those supplies . Tell him I got a thousand hospital cases

MacIntyre is down bad . You 're quite right . You could n't possibly be in a better position ... to tell me and my men to go straight to the devil . And no one would understand it better than I would . In your place , I 'd do it myself . But in spite of that and in spite of the fact ... that I can promise you no reward ... that I can offer you nothing but exposure to death ... I want your help . Once before , I was a doctor . I 'm still a doctor . Thank you , Dr . Mudd . [Buck] . [Buck] . We 're - - We 're going up in the open . Will you give me a hand , sir , please ? It was the last straw when they heard about Dr

zone1	make millions yourself . - But , no , I 'm not . - Yes , you are . - No . - Yes . - No , not Mr . Case 's little boy . I 'm a plain man of the people . I began life with these two bare hands . So did the gentleman over the fireplace . Take heart from Grandfather . - Do n't tell me you 're one of those Setons ? - Yes , Johnny . Forgive us , but we are . This is too much . What man has done , man can do , or words to that effect . Now see here , if you think I 'm going to be any young wizard of finance , you 're ... . Cheer up , it 's not at all that serious . If you do n't think breaking the news of this engagement to Father is serious ... . - You said you were going to church ? - I am . That 's why I 'm clever . Because Father 's in church and in church Father
zone1	him ? - No . But this is the best way . You know , Father is a wonderful man , but he has to be handled just right . You leave that to me . Your job is to drop me off at church and be back before 1:00 for lunch and do n't be late . His first impression of you is terribly important . What if I crawled in on my hands and knees ? Would he like that ? Now do n't jest , boy . Now , come on , darling . Let 's not let the fun get out of it . - Is it likely to ? - No , but ... . Say it . Well , what 's the idea of spilling it so quickly ? Well , I have to tell Father . He 'd never forgive me . Yeah , but it could be such a swell guilty secret for a while . I ca n't see what particular fun a secret would be . - Ca n't you , dear ? - No . All right . -
zone1	- You did n't think it 'd be simple , did you ? - I suppose I just did n't think . - You could n't have . Johnny , what 's the matter with you ? I just hate the thought of sitting down with another man and being practical about you . Angel . Look , darling , it 's got to be done though . - I love you , Julia . - I love you , Johnny . - That 's the main thing , is n't it ? - Darling , that 's everything . - Kiss ? - With pleasure . Why , Julia , for shame . Is this the way to spend Sunday morning ? Who 's your partner , anyone I know ? Johnny , my sister , Linda . This is Johnny Case . - How do you do ? - Well , thanks , and you ? - Could n't be better . - Good . - He 's Johnny Case . I 'll marry him . - That makes it all right then . In about one month
zone1	out here in the light , will you , Case ? - I 've never seen him before . - Neither had I until 10 days ago at Placid . But how did you get together ? Tell me everything . - I was ... . - Well , I ... . Go ahead . I was walking along the road one morning to the rink when whom should I see , but this man coming along carrying his skis . Well , fancy that . A downright romance . Go on , dear . He had a queer look on his face . I can believe that . His eyes must have been burning . No . As a matter of fact , the trouble was with his nose . So I stopped him and said : " Pardon me . I do n't think you realize it , but your nose is frozen . " He said , " Thanks . Can you personally do something about it ? " - Fresh . - I thought so , too . She was fresh to mention it . It
zone1	good thing when I see it . Just a minute . Does Father know about these goings-on ? I 'm off to church to tell him now . This modern generation . Well , young man , I hope you realize what you 're getting yourself in for . I did n't know I was marrying into a house with an elevator . It is n't only the elevator . The place is haunted . You mean ghosts ? Frightful ghosts all wearing stuffed shirts and mink-lined ties . Any skeletons in the closet ? - Julia has n't told you about Grandfather ? - No . - He stole a railroad from the stockholders . - That 's not true . And of course you 've heard about me . I 'm the black sheep . That 's a goat . - Do n't pay attention to her . - The engagement 's off . I wo n't marry into any family with a black sheep . - I think I like this man . - Hello . You 'll see him at lunch . ' Bye , darling
zone1	lunch , Sis . Placid was lovely , Father . I met a young man up there . He 's coming to lunch today . His name is Case . Johnny Case . - I 'm going to marry him , Father . - What ? Did I understand you to say ... . And who may Johnny Chase be ? - Case , Father , not Chase . - Well , then , Case . Father . Will you please tell me ... . Marry ? Did you actually say that ? Charming service . - A lovely service . - Thank you . - We shall have to talk at once , Julia . - Yes . You have n't as yet told me one intelligent fact about this ... . Johnny ? He 's a man with a definite future . He 's with Sloan and Hobson . - Indeed ? I know Sam Hobson . - You do ? Hello , Julia . Hello , Marjorie . You look well . - A mild , lovely Sunday , Edward . - Quite . - Did you
zone1	say . I do n't seem to have been there when it happened . - Good morning . - Good morning . Good morning . Kindly put your hat on , Ned . I believe I see Mr . Hobson now . - Run along home . - Yes , Father . Take your time , Father . The front door this time . Miss Julia has not returned from church yet , sir . I 'll walk around the block . - You 're expected in the playroom , sir . - Playroom ? Miss Linda asked that you be sent up the moment you arrived , sir . Miss Linda . - The playroom is on the fourth floor , sir . - Thanks . - Hey ! - Hey , yourself . I 'm lost . A lot of people have n't been coming up here . Want a bite ? Thanks . The bell captain sent me up . This is quite different . From the rest of the house , I mean . This was Mother 's idea . She thought there should be one
zone1	up here as much as we were before she died . I think it was a kind of escape for her . She was marvellous . That 's quite a doll . - That was Julia's . - Yeah ? She loved it . My , how she loved it . Looks like her . Did she love that , too ? Now do n't you say a word about Leopold . He 's very sensitive . - Yours ? - Looks like me . - Who 's the musician in the family ? - My brother , Ned . I saw him this morning when I arrived . At least I saw somebody with a hangover . That was Ned . He could have been a fine musician . - What do you mean ? - lf Father had n't interfered . - Who performed on the flying trapeze ? - All of us . And a terrible cousin of ours named Seton Cram . He and I used to swing by our knees and spit at each other . - Nice goings-on . - I 'm happy to
zone1	and I as kids . She was beautiful even then , was n't she ? Case ? What ? I love my sister Julia more than anything else in the world . I do n't blame you , so do I . She 's so sweet , you do n't know . Yes , I do . She 's beautiful and exciting , too , do n't you think ? Stop it . I 'll start jittering . It 's terribly important that she should marry the right person . - That 's important for everyone . - No . It 's particularly so for Julia . I suppose you realize you 're a rather strange bird in these parts ? How 's that ? You do n't know the men we see as a rule . Where 've you been ? Working hard . - Nights ? - Nights , too . What about these little jaunts to Placid ? Come clean , Case . Want to know something ? That was the first holiday I ever had . - No . - Sure . - Then you ca
zone1	I was 10 . - Ten ? - Sure . At what ? Anything I could get . Financial house the last few years . Does she paint ? She never told me . No , you don't . - Why , is n't she any good ? - It is n't hers , it 's mine . There lies Linda the artist . Do n't disturb the ashes . Frankly , I stank . What did you try after you discovered you could n't paint ? - Case , are you drawing me out ? - Sure . Come on . - You really want to know ? - Sure . Well , I tried to go on the stage . Would you care to see me do the sleepwalking scene from Macbeth ? - " Out , damned spot ! " - No , some other time . The teachers at Miss Porter 's School thought it was very promising . - What else ? - There were lots of humorous episodes . I tried to get Father to let me take a nursing course at a hospital
zone1	help some strikers over in Jersey . How was I to know that Father was on the board of directors of the company ? You see , Case , the trouble with me is that I never could decide whether I wanted to be Joan of Arc , Florence Nightingale or John L . Lewis . - What 's the matter , you fed up ? - To the neck . Even with this million-dollar museum ? All those marble pillars down there ? Case , compared to the life I lead the last man in a chain gang thoroughly enjoys himself . What you need 's some time off from what you 've been doing day in , day out . You mean from what I 've not been doing days in , please , years out . How does your garden grow , Case ? Is life wonderful where you are ? It can be . - But it has n't been ? - I do n't call what I 've been doing " living . " - What do you recommend for yourself ? - A holiday
zone1	as I need . - You mean just to play ? - No , I 've been working since I was 10 . I want to find out why I 'm working . The answer ca n't be just to pay bills or pile up more money . Even if you do , the government takes most of it . - But what is the answer ? - That 's what I intend to find out . The world is changing out there . There 's new exciting ideas running around . Some right , some cock-eyed , but they are affecting our lives . I want to know how I stand , where I fit in , what all this will mean to me . I ca n't find that out sitting behind a desk in an office . I 'm going to get money together , and then knock off . - Quit ? - Quit . I want to save part of my life for myself . There 's a catch to it though , it 's got to be part of the young part . You
zone1	and work when I know what I 'm working for . - Does that make sense to you ? - That makes a lot of sense . - Does Julia know ? - No . I wo n't get her hopes up until I get enough money . She has enough for two right now , or for 10 , for that matter . I do n't want her dough . I 've got to earn it myself . That 's foolish . You 're all right , though . You have n't been bitten or caught by it yet . - By what ? - The reverence for riches . - Look out for that , Johnny . - No , not for me . - Who took the Scotch from my closet ? - What happened in church ? - It was in my riding boots , a full quart . - Neddie , shut up . Did Julia tell Father ? I have n't been up here in years . What did Father say ? We left Father talking about that guy to Mr . Hobson in
zone1	? - I 'm the egg . And he 's a good egg , too . Johnny Case , my brother , Ned . How are you ? Congratulations ! This place gives me the creeps . I 've been telling Johnny about some of our childhood dreams . Some dreams . It 's in tune . I thought you 'd want to come back and finish that concerto you were writing . The Seton Concerto in F Major . Come on , Neddie . Neddie , play it . Play it , Neddie . Johnny and I can bear it . Ca n't we ? You really want to hear it ? Neddie , no . I 've been boasting about you . Hello . What are you all doing up here ? What a morning . - What did Father say ? - He is n't home yet . I want to know the minute Mr . Seton returns . Buzz up here twice , will you ? Thanks . - Was it terrible at church ? - Not so bad , but there 's dirty weather ahead
zone1	n't change that tie . - That 's right , I did n't . Well , never mind , Ned can lend you one . I feel like a goat being prepared for the sacrifice . Now , that 's a sheep . What you need is a drink . - We 'd better give him some coaching . - I 'd be grateful . Firstly , Father will want to know how you 're fixed . - Fixed ? - Money . How much ? You would n't expect it of a man in Father 's position , but money is our God here . - Johnny , it is n't true at all . - No ? What is , then ? Well , young man ? Well , sir , at the moment I have in my pocket exactly $34 and a coupon for a Bank Night at a Lake Placid movie . No gilt-edge securities , no rolling woodlands ? I have a few shares of common stock tucked away in a warm -- Common , do n't say the word . I 'm afraid he
zone1	but probably just another of the vast army of clock-watchers . - How are you socially ? - Nothing much there either . Your mother was n't even a whooziz ? - Nope . - Linda , I do wish you 'd shut up . - Maybe he 's got a judge in the family . - Yes , that might help . Old Judge Case 's boy . White pillars , guitars a-strumming . - ' Evening , Master . - How you all , Miss Linda ? - Know any prominent people ? Drop names . - Just casually , you know . At Mrs . Onderkonk 's cockfight last Tuesday , whom should I see but Mrs . Marble . - I thought we 'd die laughing . - Johnny , this is rot . " Johnny , " she calls me ... . - Linda , will you be quiet ? - I 'm having a swell time . This is terrible . Do you realize that you are trying to marry into one of America 's 60 families ? When I find myself in a
zone1	do ? Then I do the opposite . As long as you do n't do a back flip-flop . - Can you do a back flip-flop ? Really ? - Sure . But , you 'll have to teach me . I can do almost anything else . It 'll be a pity if it does n't come off , it 'll be a real pity . Yes , it 'll be a pity if this does n't come off , too . Okay . Alley . It 's Father . He 's home . Come on , Johnny . - What about the flip thing ? - No . Linda and I will go down and talk to him . You go with Ned . - Why ? - You 're not supposed to have arrived yet . - When do I arrive ? - 1:00 . 1:00 . And please change that tie . Ned will tell you exactly when to put in an appearance . This is getting very complicated , if you ask me . Nobody asked you . Now go on . Do as you
zone1	. Do n't expect simplicity here . Just think of Fifth Avenue frontage . Lend him a tie , Ned . - You do like him , do n't you ? - She asks me if I like him . Dear girl , do you realize that life walked into this house this morning ? Darling , do n't let him get away . It 'll be the same old story , of course . - I 'm being married for my money . - That 's always flattering , is n't it ? What 's the use of all we 've got unless to get us a superior type of man ? Linda , I hate you to talk like that . But , Julia , seriously he 's like spring . He 's like a breath of fresh air . Do you know what he called this place ? A museum . Julia , here 's your chance . That 's just it . I want Father to see that Johnny has the same qualities Grandfather had . You do n't know Johnny . You do n't know
zone1	- Or where he 's going . - I do . I know , I can see it as clear as day . If it does go through all right , when are you going to announce it ? - Right away . Next Saturday . - Darling , let me give a party for it . Now look , Father is to have nothing to do with it . Saturday is New Year 's Eve . Julia , let 's have some fun in this house before you leave it . - lf Father does n't mind . - No ifs at all . And just a few people . Just your friends and Johnny 's and up in the old playroom . Let me plan it . Let me give it . Let me do something for you once . Me , Julia . I 'd love it darling , really I would . No , but you see , this is awfully important to me now . Now no one must touch my party but me , do you hear ? All right , darling . Now
zone1	. Linda it 'll be awful to leave you . Julia , I do n't know what I 'll do when you go . I 've got to do something . I 've got to get out , quit , change on it somehow or I 'll go mad . I could curl up and die right now . Why , my foot . I do n't look sick , do I ? You know , this is a museum . Never mind about me . I 'll be all right . Look out for yourself . Do n't let him bully you . - Good morning . - Good morning , Father . - Did you see Mr . Hobson , Father ? - Just for a moment . There 's another thing to be considered . What is the young man 's background ? What did Mr . Hobson say ? But we must n't rush into things , must we ? I want to be married on January 10 . That 's two weeks from this Tuesday . Impossible . - Why ? - Yes , why
zone1	The boy has loads of charm , Father . - You know him ? - I 've heard tell of him . Charm . I suppose it 's solid merit you 're after . The rumour is he 's got that , too . A sterling chap on the whole . A catch , in fact . Have you the financial section of the Times , Ned ? No . I try to take Sundays off when I can . Which reminds me , I 'd like you to remain in the office until 6:00 . - 6:00 ? What for ? - As an example to the other men . - But there 's nothing for me to do after 3:00 . - You 'll find something . See here , Father , if you think I 'm going to fake -- Did you understand me , Ned ? Father , what did Mr . Hobson say ? It was n't the time or place to go into the matter with him . I asked him to drop by tonight . Father , but what did he say ?
zone1	must have been a blow . - He appears to have some business ability . He has put through a successful reorganization of Seaboard Utilities . - Seaboard ? Poor fellow . - Shrewd fellow , perhaps . Hobson says the signs are not unfavourable for Seaboard . We 'll buy some in the morning , Ned . But we must know more about Mr . Chase 's background . Case , Father . Let it go . Chase has such a sweet banking sound . - Father , he 's from Baltimore . - Fine , old , pre-war stock , I imagine . Was n't there a Judge Case somewhere ? I intend to know more about the young man than his name and his place of birth . It would be advisable that when he arrives he finds me alone in order that I may conduct the inquiry along my own lines . I wo n't allow the subject of an engagement to come up in my first talk with him . Would n't you like me to hide under the sofa and take shorthand notes ?
zone1	think the poor guy ought to see one friendly face in the courtroom . Yes , Henry ? - Mr . Case wishes to be announced , sir . - Yes , Henry . You will all excuse yourselves on one pretext or another . Keep a stiff upper lip , Father . No doubt the fellow is an impostor . - Father . - Yes , Julia ? Remember , I know what I want . Come in . I hope I 'm not late . I got caught in traffic . Father , this is Mr . Case . - How do you do ? - How do you do , sir ? My daughter Linda . - How do you do ? - How do you do ? And my son , Edward . - How do you do ? - How do you do ? Ned , if you and your sisters will do the telephoning you spoke about I shall try and entertain Mr . Case . We 'll be back in a few minutes , Johnny . What would we do without the telephone
zone1	, Linda ? Me , Father ? I ca n't remember a thing . We seem to be enjoying quite an unusual freedom from snow this winter . I like snow . That 's why I went up to Lake Placid . Placid ? Yes , my daughter Julia has just come from there . Yes , I know . - You 're in business in New York , Mr . Case ? - Yes , sir . I 'm with Sloan and Hobson . An excellent firm . - A born New Yorker ? - No , no . I was born in Baltimore . July 6 , 1908 . I 'm 30 . I used to have a lot of good friends in Baltimore . Let me see . The Whites , the Clarence Whites . - Possibly you knew them ? - I do n't believe I ever did . - No ? And there was Archer Fuller 's family . - I 'm afraid not . Let me see , Colonel Evans , old Philip Evans . No . I have n't been there in some
zone1	anyway . You see , my father had a small grocery store in Baltimore . Yes . He never made a go of it though and when he died he left several debts which Mother worked hard to clear up . I was just a child at the time and I could n't help her very much . Mother died the May before my 16th birthday . How sad . Yes , it was pretty sad . I had n't any connections except for an uncle who 's in the roofing business in Wilmington . He was n't much good , though . He was inclined to get drunk . Still is . We have an uncle like that but he keeps off roofs . Mother had wanted me to go to a big Eastern college so I worked my way through Harvard . In vacations , I worked in a steel mill and in an automobile factory . One summer I drove a garbage truck . Admirable . No , they simply happened to be the only jobs I could get but you can learn a lot in a
zone1	Harvard . Anything else , sir ? I beg your pardon ? I should think you would . Is there anything else you 'd like to know about me ? Why , that is ... . Well , Mr . Seton , how about it ? - About it ? About what ? - About Julia and me , getting married . Why , this is a complete surprise to me . I hardly know what to say to you . - Well , " yes " would be pleasant . - I 'm sure it would . However , we must go into the matter a little more carefully , I 'm afraid . The only difficulty about that is the time . Julia 's idea is January 10 . Mine , too . We 'll see about that . May I ask how we shall see , sir ? Mr . Case , I do n't know you at all . I 'll give you every opportunity you permit me . - Lunch tomorrow ? - Tomorrow I have -- Tuesday ? Suppose you meet me at the
zone1	sorry , but Friday 's out . I 've got business in Boston that day . Better make it tomorrow . I 'll see whether I can rearrange my engagements . Ned , Julia , nearly time for lunch , is n't it ? In the meantime , I think Mr . Sloan or Mr . Hobson might say a good word for me . I 'm decent and civilized and I love your daughter , which is n't hard . She seems to like me , too , and that 's about all that can be said for me except that we have a grand chance of being happy . - So do I . - Come on , Father , be an angel . The matter is too important to be decided offhand . You 'll be married when I 've come to a decision and on a day which I will name . - Our plan was the 10th . - That is out of the question . - Yes , Henry ? - Luncheon , sir . - Mr . Seton , l -- - Luncheon
zone1	have . Thank you . I have a haberdasher who 's made my ties for a good many years and that particular pattern I seem to recognize . Possibly , sir , because this happens to be your necktie . Ned and I thought it might bring me luck . Father . Come in , Julia . I thought you might like some hot chocolate . Thank you . I just saw Mr . Hobson leave . - Did you and he have a nice talk ? - Yes . Father what have you decided ? Marriage is an extremely important step for a young girl . Mother was younger than I when she married you . In marrying me , your mother and her family took no risk , either financially or , if I may say so , spiritually . - Johnny will do well financially . - No doubt about it . - Hobson tells me he has great possibilities . - I know it . Then it 's all right ? - Do you see that cigar ? - Yes , Father . That 's a
zone1	Your grandfather smoked the same brand . I know the quality of tobacco in it because I own the plantation where it was grown and I know therefore that when I light it , it will burn smoothly and pleasantly . And I know above everything else that it will never explode in my face . And you 're afraid that Johnny might ? There 's a strange new spirit at work in the world today a spirit of revolt . I do n't understand it and I do n't like it . Do n't worry about Johnny . I know him better than you . My dear , I 've never denied you anything that was in my power to give . He 'll burn , Father , calmly , steadily , pleasantly . It 's only of you and your happiness I 'm thinking . Father you can trust me . I 'll take care of myself . Thank you , Father . - Can we announce it New Year 's Eve ? - I shall arrange a party . How wonderful ! Linda had said something about
zone1	ideas of hers . I think by now you and I know how to take care of those ideas of Linda's . - It was awfully sweet of her . - Linda has many generous impulses . Father ? Come in , Linda . Is it yes ? Father , I knew you 'd do it . - Be careful , you 'll put my cigar out . - What 's a cigar on a night like this ? Darling , I 'm so glad . Have you told Johnny ? - I have n't had time . - Telephone him right away . Well , then let 's ring bells . Let 's send up skyrockets . Let 's turn on all the lights in the house . Father , are n't you proud of yourself ? Gee , this would have made Mother happy . Mother , you 'd love him . Do n't forget I 'm to give the party to announce the engagement . I 've got it all planned . Just a few people , Johnny 's friends and Julia 's and up in the
zone1	no engraved invitations . I like your tie , too . - By the way , where 's Linda ? - She 'll be down soon . I 'm sure she will . - She just hates big parties . - But not this one ? Johnny , look at Father . He 's just seething with excitement . You 've won his heart completely . - He 's been awfully nice to me . - Father 's such a dear . He made all the arrangements for the party himself . Is that the fellow ? He 's rather good-looking at least . - Hello , Uncle Edward . - Good evening . - Seton . - Good evening , Uncle Edward . There 's Laura and Seton Cram . He 's my cousin . Darling , tell me , when are you to announce the exciting news about Julia ? Shortly after midnight as a surprise . Well , Julia seems divinely happy . What does Linda say ? You know , we have n't seen Linda all evening . Linda has been somewhat indisposed . If asked
zone1	of course , Linda 's headaches . Now , do n't worry , darling , we understand perfectly . She shall come down before the announcement . Of course . Now do n't worry , darling , you just leave everything to us , will you ? It 's a lovely party . Now what 's the matter with Linda ? Hello , Dorothy , you look lovely . - Dear , where 'd she get that horrible dress ? - Uncle Edward is worried , is n't he ? - Hello , Bunny . - Hello , Seton . I 'd be worried , too , if I had children like Ned and Linda . Now he takes an utter stranger into the family . I do n't approve of it at all . If Linda had done it I could understand , but for Julia to take an unknown climber ... . Mother 's furious about it . He 's obviously after Julia 's money . Hello , Countess . He does n't even belong to the Harvard Club . Julia , darling , you look lovely .
zone1	. - Hello , Seton . - I 'm Cousin Laura and I 'm so happy about it . My dear , he is attractive , is n't he ? This is my husband , Seton Cram . He 's Julia 's cousin . - I married into the family . - Not a bad family to marry into . Congratulations . - Thank you , Mr . Cram . - Do n't " Mister " him . We grew up together . We 've heard such wonderful things about you . - Have you ? From whom ? - Well , from everybody . My dear , it 's such a shame about Linda . She does have such frightful luck with those headaches of hers , does n't she ? Yes . There 's Ned . We 've been looking for him . Come on . We 'll see you later . - Good-bye , Johnny . - See you later , Johnny . Ned , did you speak to Linda ? How do you like Seton and Laura ? It 's a privilege to meet them ,
zone1	Cheer up , Johnny . If you find Seton and Laura dull , wait until you meet some of the others . The more you find out about us Setons , the more impressive we become . Father wanted a big family , you know . Mother had Linda straight off to oblige him . Linda was a girl , so she promptly had Julia . Julia was a girl and it seemed hopeless . The next year Mother had me and there was much joy in the land . It was a boy and the fair name of Seton would flourish . It must have been a consolation to Father . He must have been very grateful to Mother . Drink to Mother , Johnny . She tried to be a Seton for a while , then gave up and died . You 're talking through your hat , Ned . But , I 'm not . Ned , what did Linda say ? - She 's coming down , is n't she ? - Do n't make me laugh , Sister . - What 's all this about
zone1	's right . It 's nothing . Just one of Linda 's whims . The silly little girl wanted to give her kind of a party . Between you and Father you 've changed her shindig into a first-class funeral . She should 've realized Father could n't announce my engagement without a fuss . She should have , yes , but unlike me , Linda always hopes . Bottoms up to Linda . Ned , please , you 've been drinking steadily since 8:00 . Yes , funny old Ned . On New Year 's Eve , too . Johnny , try to stop him . I shall drink as much as I like at any party I agree to attend . And as much as I like is as much as I can hold . It 's my protection against your tiresome friends . Linda 's out of luck . She has n't any protection . Robert , another highball , please . Ned , take it easy . Aye , aye , sir . - The name , sir ? - The name is Professor Nicholas Potter
zone1	ladies ' cloakroom is the second door to the left , madam . Thank you . - Hello , Mr . Thayer . - Well . - It 's getting near the New Year . - That 's right , sir . - It lacks about an hour , I should say . - An hour and 38 minutes , Edgar . Thank you , sir . - The elevator is to the rear and right . - Would it be too much -- Hello , Mr . Jennings . - Coming close to the New Year now . - One hour and 27 minutes , Edgar . - He 's fast . - Yes , sir . The elevator is to the rear and right . - Thank you , but you have my shoe . - I beg your pardon . It 's quite all right . A very natural mistake , as a matter of fact . Thank you . I 'll do it . Do n't tell anyone , but I 've got a run in my stocking . Good heavens , we 're ruined .
zone1	- No , sir . The elevator ... . Is to the rear and to the right . I 'm sorry . - Perhaps we 'd better use the elevator . - To the rear and to the right . I think we 'd better go home . Courage , dear , courage . Remember , we promised Johnny that we 'd come . This reminds me a little of the palace of the Emperor Caligula . - You remember Caligula , do n't you ? - Very well , indeed . Whatever became of him ? - To the rear ... . - And to the right . Now where ? Seems to have been some sort of a residence at one time . It 's the Gashouse Gang , darling . The party 's downstairs . Thank you . Sorry to intrude . No . Wait a minute . - You 're Susan Elliott ? - Yes . My married name is Potter . No , but you lectured once at our school . I 'm Linda Seton . - You 're not . - Yes . -
zone1	my sister . - You know Johnny ? - For years . I 'm so glad to see you . Come in . - Who 's that ? - That is my husband , Nick Potter . You can come in , too . Close the door . Who lives here ? I live here . I live here , in a manner of speaking . I see . You would n't eat your oatmeal this morning , so they wo n't let you go to the party ? I 'm the mad sister , the family problem . The one they do n't speak about . - Yes , so was I . - You see what happened to her . - What ? - She had to marry me . A professor without a cent of money . So you 'd better be a good little girl and eat your porridge . - Sit down , will you ? - Thank you . - My , it 's good to be home again . - Yes , we 've had quite a long walk . - This is
zone1	I was going to give a party tonight . I had it all planned . I was going to ... . Well , it was a good idea . It might have been fun . - Your sister , Julia . - Is she anything like you ? Do n't worry , she 's not at all like me . - Have n't you met her yet ? - No . You must . Johnny 'll be glad to see you . - But you must . It 'll spoil Johnny 's party . - Definitely no . Definitely no . My brother , Ned . I thought you might want a little cheering up . Ned , how sweet of you , how really sweet . I 'm a sweet kid . Take this back to the orchestra leader , please . My brother , Ned , Mr . and Mrs . Potter . Friends of Johnny 's . He used to live with us . We 've come to warn his future bride . He never puts the cap back on the toothpaste . Then we 'll drink
zone1	it ? No , I 'm wrong . He does n't need it . Johnny 's doing all right . - What 's on your mind , Ned ? - Nothing 's on my mind . What do you mean , " Johnny 's doing all right ? " I mean he 's doing all right . He 's having a whirl . His hair 's slicked down and Father 's seeing that he meets the important people . My word , are there important people downstairs ? Frightfully important . That 's why I wanted to give a party up here . Miss Seton on New Year 's Eve entertained a group of very unimportant people . To our hostess . May I drink , too ? Believe it or not , I 've just been learning how much it costs to keep up a yacht . - What 's the matter ? - Father sent for me . It 's about Linda . Everybody has begun to talk about her not being here . - She 's simply got to come down . - Got to ? Go
zone1	. - I 'll ask her . - Insist on it . I 'll do what a gentleman can do under the circumstances . - That 's good . Was that good ? - No ! Yeah , marvellous . - Unless I 'm getting drunk . - No . It 's the first champagne I 've had since I was 4 . Not really ? - Do you mind if I play with your toys ? - I think you 'd better . - Thank you . - That 's all right . He 's grand . - Has Johnny any other friends like him ? - There are n't many people like Nick . Or like Johnny either , for that matter . - We 've had wonderful times , we three . - You 'll have a lot more fun with Julia . You must let Ned and me be guest members of the Johnny , Julia , Nick and Susan Club . Look what I 've found . Come on , let 's do Romeo and Juliet . " What light through yonder window breaks ?
zone1	kids . - Did you ? - This is a lovely one . - Do one for us . Go ahead . Come on , Neddie . It 's all complete , including the characters . You remember any of the lines ? Linda . Johnny , come in . - I have a message for you . - And I have a message for you . I have the honour to inform you that your presence is requested downstairs . I have the honour to inform you that your presence is requested right here . - There 's a meeting of the club . - Your club . No . Come on , the party needs you . Now 's the time to come to the aid of the party . But your father is really upset . Why , you do n't tell me . What seems to be the matter ? Everybody has begun to notice you 're not there and it 's embarrassing the family . The ... . Johnny -- Linda , be a good sport now . It will make your father awfully happy
zone1	in on my hands and knees ? That 's telling him . Oh , my . - That 's not Johnny . - No ? - Who is it ? - That 's a very important person . Hello , important person . Do n't be fresh . - Treat important persons with respect . - I won't . - Hello , important person . - Yeah ? Take your place . What is this ? It 's the voice of experience . Nick and Susan ! Sir , that lady is my wife . Nick , thank goodness you came . The face is familiar . But ... . Do we know anyone who smells of violet ? - How 's that , you dog . - No . It ca n't be . It 's Johnny Case . You remember him . John Case , the rail-splitter , friend of the people . Yes . - Well , we 're glad to have you back . - Back ? You mean the marble pillars got me . I 'm ready . I 'll go quietly . Do n't
zone1	you 've got that off my mind . - Never forget it . There 's something I want you to know . - That deal I mentioned ? - The Seaboard thing ? - I think it 'll go through . - You do n't mean it ? There 's a very fair chance that I 'll be able to quit business next Saturday . So that you can go on the holiday ? Sure , Johnny 's Declaration of Independence . It 's all according to what a Boston crowd called Bay State Power does . - Maybe they 've done it already . - They 'll do it ! - Then let 's drink to Bay State Power . - No , let 's drink to Julia . - Have you met her yet ? - No . If she 's anything like her sister ... . No , we 'll drink to Johnny and Julia and Bay State Power , love and happiness and ... . Here you are . For the love of Pete , it 's The Witch and Dopey . I 've never been
zone1	n't it ? We like it . Linda , are you aware that there 's another party going on in this house ? You mean that low-class dancehall downstairs ? Do n't speak of it . Excuse me , these are my friends . Professor and Mrs . Potter , Mr . and Mrs . Cram . How do you do ? You old fox , you . Fox ? Sam Hobson 's been telling me about your little haul in Seaboard . You might have let us in the family in on it . - There 's still time . - Not the way that stock 's acting . We have an order to buy 60,000 shares for Ross of Bay State Power all the way up to 30 . - Are you sure of that ? - I took the order myself . That cinches it . - Is that it ? - Just about . Good for you . Come on ! Good for you . Have lunch with me at the club on Tuesday . I think I could help you double your yield . My
zone1	. You 're probably joking , Professor . With the help of the right people in Wall Street you 'll make more within two years . It would n't take that long if we had the right kind of government . - Like which country for example , Mr . Cram ? - Now no political arguments . - Let 's go downstairs and celebrate . - Yes , this is a wonderful party . - I 'm not going downstairs . - Come on , do n't be foolish . - But , Linda , your father said -- - I thought so but I 'm not going downstairs . - Of course if -- - I would n't keep anyone who wants to . If you ask me , this is the worst case of downright rudeness I 've seen . And has someone asked you ? Come , dear , we can discuss this later . You would n't care to swing on the trapeze and discuss it now , would you , Seton ? We shall see you later , Mrs . Porter . Professor Porter
zone1	be wrong . In appreciation of your great success in the fields of love and finance I wish to congratulate you on behalf of the members of the Fifth Avenue Anti-Stuffed Shirt and Flying Trapeze Club . And present you , my dear boy , with this token of their affection and esteem . Thank you , thank you , thank you . Mr . Toastmaster , ladies and gentlemen . My friends . I am not much of a speechmaker , so I hardly know how to thank you . This young lady and myself have been practicing a few feats of acrobatic skill with which we shall be glad to entertain you . Alley . - Ready ? - Ready . Put on the lights . Uno momento . - Alley . - Oop . Linda . The club is adjourned . Julia , I 've got a grand surprise for you . Just a moment . Come down now . It 's nearly 12:00 and we want the entire party together to see the New Year in . The New Year comes into this room , too
zone1	I want to see the New Year in as I had planned , as I had asked you -- I think if you do n't mind we 'll go down and see what 's happened to the furnace . Julia , this is Nick and Susan . I told you about them . How do you do ? - And Mr . Seton . - Your friends are always welcome here . I 'll see you downstairs . Thank you , but as a matter of fact Susan has an awful run in her stocking . Why do n't you go down to my room ? It 's on the third floor . Fine . Congratulations on your engagement , Miss Seton . You 're not getting very much , but I 'm sure you can improve him . Kindly walk , do not run to the nearest exit . They 're grand people . - They 'll wait , do n't you think ? - I do n't know . I do n't know . There 's no cause for temper , child . Run along and we 'll
zone1	for a moment . Listen to me , Father , tonight means a good deal to me . I do n't know what or how precisely . Something 's trying to take it away and I ca n't let it go . I 'll put in an appearance downstairs . Then I want to bring those people back here . I want to sit and have supper with them . We wo n't disturb anyone . That 's all right with you , is n't it ? Your place is downstairs . Once more , this is important to me . Do n't ask me why . It has something to do with this room when I was a child and good times in it . What special virtue this room has I 'm sure I do n't know . You do n't , do you ? No , you ca n't . I 'll tell you , this room 's my home , it 's the only home I 've got . There 's something here that I understand and that understands me . - Maybe it 's Mother
zone1	say . You thought I 'd come around . You always think people will come around . Not me , not tonight . And I sha n't be disturbed either ' cause if there 's one thing you hate , it 's a scene . I can promise you one if you interfere . I can promise you a beauty . Johnny , so there 's good news , is there ? Was Mother a sweet soul , Father ? Linda , if you 're not happy here why do n't you go away ? I 'll be glad if next month you take a maid and a companion and take a trip somewhere . You distress me . You cause nothing but trouble and upsets . That 's just what I 'm going to do . - No maid and no companion . Just me . - As you wish . I 've been dying to get out for years . I 've never known it so well as tonight . I ca n't stand it here any longer . It 's doing terrible things to me . And
zone1	room . This room . I do n't think you 'll be able to stand it long . I 'll come back when you 've left it . I do n't believe I need to worry about the way you 'll take care of Julia , need I ? We 'll try to manage , thanks , sir . Seton has told us of your very successful manipulations of Seaboard . I consider that a very fine piece of work . I congratulate you . Is n't it marvellous ? What a New Year . When you return from your honeymoon if I 'm not much mistaken there 'll be a desk waiting for you at the bank . That 's very kind of you , sir but the success of the Seaboard deal makes possible a certain plan of my own . But , Johnny ... . A plan ? Yes ? I 'm afraid I 'm not quite as anxious as I might be for the things most people work towards . I do n't want too much money . - Too much money ? - Well ,
zone1	been my idea to make a few thousands early in the game and then quit for as long as it lasts and try to find out who I am and what goes on now , while I 'm young and feel good all the time . I 'm sure Julia understands what I 'm getting at , do n't you , Julia ? I 'm not sure I do , Johnny . You wish to occupy yourself otherwise , is that it ? Please do n't make me feel guilty about it . Even if it is a fool idea that people dream about and then go flat on . Even if I find I 've had enough of it in three months , I want it . If I let this chance go by , there 'll never be another for me so I do n't think anyone will mind if I just have a go at it , will they , Julia ? Will they , dear ? - Father , let Johnny and me talk awhile . - Just a moment . In all my experience --
zone1	I promise you . Case , it strikes me you chose a strange time to tell us this . A very strange time . - Father . - I see , sir . Then ... . Then perhaps -- Father , please go down . We 'll come in a minute . He did n't get what I was driving at , at all . Why did you do it ? You knew all that talk would antagonize him . - You think talk is all it was ? - I think it was less than that . I 'm furious with you . It was n't just talk , Julia . You do n't realize what Father is offering you . Wait a minute , dear . - We 'd better get clear on this . - I 'm clear on it right now . If you think you can persuade me that a man of your energy and your ability possibly could quit at 30 ... . If you 're tired and want a rest , why , we 'll have it . Have n't you the remotest
zone1	, I know . But you have n't any idea yet of how exciting business can be . See it through . You 'll love it . I know you will . There 's no such thrill in the world as making money . Darling , you do n't see what I 'm aiming at either . Try a little blind faith for a while , wo n't you ? - Come along with me ? - But -- No , the whole way , dear . Johnny , wait till next year or two years and we 'll think about it again . You can do that for me , for us , ca n't you ? You think by then I 'd be a good sport and come around , that 's what you think , do n't you ? It lacks six minutes to the New Year if anyone 's interested . Come on , Johnny . Have Nick and Susan gone ? I do n't know . They were n't in my room . - Perhaps they 're downstairs . - Perhaps . Anyone care for
zone1	? This is plain stubbornness and you know it . Listen , Julia . No , that gets you nowhere , does it ? Are you coming ? I think I 'll wait a moment with Linda if you do n't mind . But I do mind . Will you come , please ? In a moment , Julia . You 'd better run on down now , do n't you think ? Not right away . I 'm afraid I wo n't know how to entertain you . I 've done all my stuff . I do n't need entertaining . You would n't care to step into a waltz as the old year dies , would you , Mr . Case ? Yes , I would . I 'd love it . There 's a conspiracy against you and me , child . What 's that ? - The vested interests . - I know . They wo n't let you have any fun and they wo n't give me time to think . I suppose like the fathead you are , you told Father all your little
zone1	. - Poor boy . What about your own evening ? Not so hot either . Poor girl . - Of course , they may be right . - Do n't you believe it . I do n't know . They seem so awfully sure . It 's still your ride , is n't it ? You know where you want to go , do n't you ? - I thought I did . - So did I . Pathetic , was n't it , all my fuss and fury over anything as unimportant as this party . Maybe it is important . Well , if it is , I 'm not , and I guess that 's the answer . Linda , you 're so sweet . Thanks , that 's enough . It was grand . Listen . That 's it , all right . Happy New Year , Johnny . Happy New Year , Linda . You can count on sister Linda , Johnny . Run on down now . They 'll be waiting . Linda . What ? They 've ... . - Your father put
zone1	love Julia ? Of course I do . Well , if ever she needed you , she needs you now . You 're all that 's left . Go on , Johnny . Happy New Year . Same to you . - What 's it like to get drunk , Ned ? - It 's ... . How drunk ? Good and drunk . Grand . How is it ? Well , to begin with it brings you to life . Does it ? And after a while you begin to know all about it . You feel , I do n't know , important . That must be good . It is . And then pretty soon the game starts . What game ? A swell game , a terribly exciting game . You think clear as crystal but every move , every sentence is a problem . That gets pretty interesting . - You get beaten though , do n't you ? - Sure , but that 's good , too . Then you do n't mind anything , not anything at all . Then you sleep .
zone1	while . As long as you last . Ned , that 's awful . Think so ? Other things are worse . Where do you end up ? Where does everybody end up ? You die . And that 's all right , too . Ned , can you do it on champagne ? Why ? What 's the matter , Linda ? Nothing . - I know . - Yes ? Johnny . Give me some more wine , Ned . - He 's in a spot , is n't he ? - Give me some , Ned . You can tell me about it , dear . I love the boy , Neddie . I thought so . Great , is n't it ? Great . Here 's luck to you . I do n't want any luck . Ladies and gentlemen , my good friends , I have the honour to announce to you the engagement of my daughter Julia to Mr . John Case . An event which doubles the pleasure I take in wishing you and them a most happy and prosperous New Year .
zone1	. - Are n't you thrilled ? Is n't it -- - I am . - I 'm sure you 'll be very happy . - You 're thinking of my sister . - What ? - Not I ! My sister . Linda , now you must get married yourself . - Thank you . - I 'm so happy for you . Thank you for coming down . You must go back to bed . The doctor said you should n't excite yourself . What is this ? Where 's the lucky boy ? I have n't seen the lucky boy since the announcement . - Linda , did you know about it ? - Of course I did . - Where is he ? - That 's something I would n't know . I do n't know . He wanted to argue with Father . He did n't make sense . He said things to Father he had no right to say . Then after the announcement to go downstairs and leave us . It 's horrible . Please do n't be so upset . I 'll
zone1	be fine . Of all times -- - Linda , is n't it too marvellous ? - Too , too marvellous . I 'll ... . - Linda , now you must get married . - I hope I shall . Linda needs to find a husband . - Hello . It is wonderful , is n't it ? - It 's simply lovely . - Hello . How 's Baltimore ? - It 's fine , thank you . - Have you seen Mr . Case anywhere ? - Mr . Case went through here a moment ago . Through there ? - Did Mr . Case come in here ? - Yes , ma'am , right through here , ma'am . " Happy New Year , " he says . Congratulations to Miss Julia , ma'am . Thank you . - Linda . Come in . - Hello , Susan . I 'm sorry to butt in . Well , as I live . Look , it 's the acrobat lady . - Glad to see you . - Glad to see you , too . Run to
zone1	tried to call . - The phone 's been discontinued . We pay our bills . It 's that we 're planning a little trip . - You 're sailing ? - Tonight . Come on in and help us pack . The university gave me leave to work in France . And we 're doing our best ... . You ought to have some tea or something . You look peaked . I 've been hunting for Johnny . I thought he 'd be here . Have you seen him ? Not since that night . - You knew he walked out . - Yes . He came here and we talked until New Year 's noon . Then he left town to think things over . - His letter said he 'd be back today . - Then I can see him ! He 's probably on his way . Has n't your sister heard from him ? If she has , she has n't told me . - You love her a great deal , do n't you ? - Yes . A lot of good that
zone1	as your father does -- Johnny 'll fix that . Johnny 'll fix everything . If I could only make Julia and Father listen to me . I 've got to . Johnny 's so sweet , he 's so attractive . What 's the matter with the girl anyway ? She ought to know by now that men like Johnny do n't grow on every bush . Linda , is n't it just possible that the things we like in Johnny may be the very things she ca n't stand ? The fate that you feel he 'll save her from is the one fate in this whole world she wants ? I do n't believe that . Even so , she loves him and there 's been a break . Would n't you think she 'd be woman enough to hang on ? Yes , if she loves him . Julia has never in her life loved anyone but Johnny . - Perhaps herself . - That 's not true . Even in this , it 's of him she 's thinking , she may be mistaken ,
zone1	how a girl in love feels . - We 're sorry , Linda , really . - No , you 're not . You 're ... . What 's the matter with me anyway ? Even if I told you what was the matter with you , you would n't admit it . - I do n't know what you 're talking about . - Pay no attention to her . If you did anything else then you would n't be what you are . Which to my professorial mind is head of the class . - I love you two . - And so do we love you . In our rough , uncouth way , of course . - Johnny is seeing your sister this afternoon . - Yes ? He 's asking her to sail with us and with him tonight . - What do you think she 'll say ? - Yes . What if she does n't ? What happens then ? What 's Johnny to do ? What would you want him to do ? That may be he . Nicholas Porter ? The
zone1	you . Thanks . Julia will sail , she must , she 's got to . Good-bye . Julia . Hello , dear . You 'll be late for the Todds ' dinner , wo n't you ? You had luncheon with Johnny . He wants you to sail tonight . - You 've seen him ? - The Potters told me . You must sail with him . - The Potters ? Who are the Potters ? - Stop it , Julia . - Stop what ? - Pretending you do n't care . You 're taking my little difficulty more seriously than I am . Do n't let Johnny go off tonight and make a hash of both your lives . You ca n't let him sail alone . He 's no more sailing than you are . Does Father know you are n't going to the Todds ' dinner ? Why do you want to shut me out in the cold like this ? I was n't aware that I was . Wo n't you just talk to me ? Please , Julia . If there 's
zone1	've done it . Me ? Johnny and I have had a difference and you 're siding with him , are n't you ? But he 's right . - He 's right for you as well as for himself . - I think that 's for me to decide . - Not Father ? - Father has nothing to do with it . He happens to agree with me where you do n't . But ... . But we 've always agreed before , always . No . I think quite often I 've given in , in order to avoid scenes and upsets and ... . Is that true , Julia ? You 've always been the stronger character . At least people have always thought so . You 've made the decisions and had the ideas . And you 've been resenting me . I ca n't believe it . It 's nothing to get into a stew about . I did n't say I resented you . You 've been an immense help often . When it comes to determining my future and the future of
zone1	, Julia ? What do you want , just security ? Sit back smugly in your bank vault among the worthies of the world ? One thing I do n't want is to start this endless discussion all over again . You 've only 20 minutes in which to dress . Linda , did you hear me ? Father , I think you 're both giving Johnny the rottenest kind of a deal . - In what way ? - In every way . - You 're not thinking of what 's best for him . - On the contrary . The young man 's outlook has merely become somewhat confused . - You 'll straighten it out for him . - We shall try . But why has n't he the right to live part of his life as he wants to ? Linda , I should like to understand what he and you are aiming at but I confess , I can not . I consider his whole attitude un-American . - Are you serious ? - Entirely . Then he is and he wo n't go to
zone1	life devoted to piling up money is all it 's cracked up to be . Strange , is n't it , when he has us right before his eyes for such a shining example ? I listened most attentively the other day to our young dreamer and I still must confess that the talk of the two of you seems to me of the 17-year-old variety . I 'm glad if it is . We 're grand at 17 . It 's after that , that sickness sets in . Well , I feel very well myself . You both think he 'll come around . Compromise , anyway . You 'll get fooled . He wo n't give way one inch . - Stubborn ? - No , right and knows he 's right . What 's the matter , kid ? I ca n't believe it , Ned . Johnny 's clearing out . He 's sailing tonight and Julia wo n't lift a finger to stop him . I do n't understand her . Most people , including Johnny and yourself , make a big mistake about
zone1	At bottom she 's a very dull girl and the life she pictures for herself is the life she belongs in . You 've just never hit it off , that 's all . - Ned . - What ? You remember what we talked about on New Year 's Eve ? Sure , I remember . - Tell me something . - Sure . Does it stand out all over me ? Why ? Nick and Susan , this afternoon . I think they got it . Anyone who loves you would , Linda . That 's awful . I 'm so ashamed . I 'm not , though . Why should you be ? Pardon me , Miss Linda . - Yes , Henry . - Mr . Case is downstairs . Have him come up , will you , Henry ? And , Henry , tell Miss Julia . He 'll be up in a minute . Are you sure you want to get over him ? No , I 'm not and that 's what scares me most . I feel alive and I love it
zone1	. But it ca n't get anywhere so it 's like living on that stuff . - I 've got to get over it . - Because it seems so hopeless , is that it ? Seems ? What do you mean ? Do n't you know ? Let me tell you something . You 're twice as attractive as Julia ever thought of being . You 've got twice the looks , twice the mind and 10 times the quality . You could charm a bird off a tree if you would and why not ? If you were in her way she 'd ride you down like a rabbit . How could you , Ned , knowing the way she loves him ? - How could you ? - All right , Linda . Tell him hello for me , will you ? - Hello , Linda . - Hello , Johnny . I sent for Julia . I feel as if I 'd been away quite a while . Yeah . - I went to Placid . - I see . It was ... . - It
zone1	I 'm going to take that job at the bank . - I see . Only for a while , only for a couple of years . Just until I can get it through to her that ... . It was what she asked and after all , a couple of years is n't a lifetime . - Is it ? - Of course not . - I think everything will be all right , Johnny . - Sure . I can see the way they feel about it . I could hardly expect them to do a complete , sudden about-face but ... . But , hang it , why ca n't they see what I 'm getting at ? Perhaps eventually they will . That 's what I 'm counting on . Linda you agree there 's only one thing for me to do now , do n't you ? Compromise ? Yes . Yes . You think that 's right , do n't you ? - I do n't think it matters a bit what I think . - It does though , Linda . You think
zone1	think it 's right . Johnny , when two people love each other as much as you do anything that keeps them apart must be wrong . - Good evening . - Good evening , sir . They tell me you 've been away . Pleasant having you back . It 's pleasant to be back . There 's been a rather noticeable absence of snow these recent weeks . Quite . Father , Johnny came tonight to see Julia . That does n't surprise me a great deal , Daughter , not a great deal . Julia , not you and me . Come on , Dada , let 's go bye-bye . Good evening , Johnny . - Get your coat , darling , we 're going out . - Yes , dear . Father , could you explain to the Todds ? Please , close the door . I wish to speak with you both . You insist on putting me into a position that I do n't in the least relish . Who 's there ? Come in , Ned . - Sorry . I just
zone1	, Son . Coming between two young people in love is furthest from my wish or intention . For love , true love , is a very rare and beautiful thing . Where are you going ? Please , sit down . And I believe that its path that is to say the course of true love , contrary to the adage , should run smooth . I am a man of 58 years and speak from a long experience and observation . It is of paramount importance -- - I beg your pardon , sir ? - Yes ? If that position at the bank is still open I 'll be glad to take it . I 'm still not convinced . I still do n't believe in it , but it 's what Julia wishes and ... . And I 'm glad to defer to her wish . - You 're not convinced , you say ? - Would you like me to lie to you , sir ? Father , it 's enough for me . Julia said a year or two . I 'll do everything
zone1	have only one reservation . If , at the end of that time , I still think it 's wise for me to quit ... - ... there wo n't be any objections . - I doubt there 'll be reason for any . We shall have to see about that . Well , Father ? - When is it you wish to be married ? - As soon as possible . Now the sun shines once more and we 're all friends again . And now what are your plans for your wedding trip , may I ask ? - We have n't any definite -- - It 's wise to prearrange honeymoons . Now let me suggest a little itinerary . You will land at Plymouth or Southampton and proceed straight to London . I shall cable my sister tomorrow . They will be delighted to have you stay with them . He is one of the most important men in British banking circles . You could scarcely go abroad and not stop with your Aunt Helen , Julia . In addition it will save hotel expenses and
zone1	cable the Bovays in Paris . He 's expert adviser to the Minister of Finance . A valuable man for you to know . I had thought of this as a honeymoon more than a business trip , sir . There 's no harm in combining a little business with pleasure . I 've never found there was . They have a lovely place , Johnny , just outside of Paris . Now a week in London , a week in Paris , 10 days in the South of France , ideal . Then you could sail from Genoa and return by southern route .

" Be back , " did you say ? What do you think I am ? I hope this experience , hard as it may have been -- Do n't worry about me . I 'm all right . Even a little more than all right , I should say . - What 's with you ? Will you kindly -- - You do n't love him . Answer me . Do you or not ? - What 's that to you ? - You do n't , do you ? It 's

Will you come , Ned ? - Listen , Father -- - A trip now is out of the question . - You won't . - Can't . - Caught ? - Maybe . - I 'll be back for you , Ned . - I 'll be here . You 've got no faith in Johnny
zone1	, you think . What if it should ? There will be another . I 've got faith in Johnny . Whatever he does is all right with me . If he wants to dream for a while , he can and if he wants to come back and sell peanuts , how I 'll believe in those peanuts . Good-bye , Julia . Good-bye , Father . - Good-bye , Neddie . - Good-bye , kid . Good luck . Never you fear , I 'll be back for you , my fine bucko . All right . Linda . Try and stop me , someone . Please someone try and stop me . I shall not permit it . I shall ... . - Permit Linda ? Do n't make me laugh . - She 's going with him , is n't she ? Is n't she ? - Going to get her Johnny . - A fine chance she 's got . Any bets ? Any bets , Julia ? To Linda . And while we 're at it , Grandfather . Dear , what a trip

My word . - Where 's Julia ? - I left her sitting on her golden throne . - Johnny is taking the big ride by himself . - No . Boy , champagne , any amount of it , but hurry . - Oui , Monsieur Porter . - The name is Potter . Let 's change our name to Porter . Then they 'll call us Potter . What happened ?

We should have said we were looking for a lost cricket ball . - yes , but he spoke to her , There must be some explanation . - There is . Please forgive me , iam quite possibly be wrong , but I have known cases where a sudden shock or blow - has induced a most vivid impression . - I understand . - You do n't believe me . - It 's not a question of belief . Even a concussion may have curious effects upon an imaginative person . Yes , But I can remember every little detail . Her name , Miss Froy , everything . So interesting . you know If one had time , one could trace the cause of the hallucination . - Hallucination ? - oh ! Precisely . There is no Miss Froy , there was n't Miss Froy merely

Such as you being mixed up in a divorce case . - Yes In that first careless rapture , you said did n't care what happened . The law , like Caesar 's wife , must be above suspicion . Even when the law spends six weeks with Caesar 's wife ? - Look here Now I know why you 've been running around like a scared rabbit . - Why you lied a few minutes ago . - I lied ? Yes , to those people in the corridor . I heard every word you said . merely , I did n't wish to be mixed up in any inquiry . Inquiry ! Just because a little woman ca n't be

A scandal like that might lead anywhere . - Anywhere . - Yes . I suppose it might . - Nobody ? - Nobody . All that came out my side was two bits of orange peel and a paper bag . I know there 's a Miss Froy . She 's real as you are That 's what you saying , I believe it but does nt appear nobody else has seen her . I saw her , I think . You did ? - A little woman in tweeds wearing 3 quarter clothes - With a scarf ? - that's rite - I saw her with you when you passed the compartment - I knew I was right . - But Your husband said he had n't seen her . - He did n't notice but as soon as he mentioned it I remembered at once You win .

This lady actually saw Miss Froy . - So We shall have the train searched . - You like to think a fresh theory . doctor ? It is n't not Necessary , My theory was perfectly good one . The facts were misleading . - I hope you find your friend . Excuse me . - I 'll be in here if you want me Right you are . Come along . Eric . I was only going to mention that i told that girl that I 'd seen her friend . - Have you taken leave of your senses ? - On the contrary . I 've come to them . - What do you mean ? - If there 's scandal , there 'd be a divorce . You could n't let me down.could you You will have to do the decent thing , - as reluctantly as only you know how . - You forget one important thing , Margaret .

All right , relax , the crisis is over . come on , Let 's join the lady . - Here we are . - Miss Froy . - That is n't Miss Froy . - Is n't it ? - No . - It 's silly to say but are you Miss Froy ? No . I am Madam Kummer . She helped you into the carriage , then went to see some friends . As you spoke of the English lady , she did n't connect her with Madam Kummer . But she was n't the lady i saw . It was Miss Froy . - Oatmeal tweeds , blouse ... - yes I know , everything 's the same - but it is n't her . beg your pardon - When did you meet Miss Froy ? - Last night
zone1	costume like this ? - Yes , I think so . - Then I must apologise . You did meet her . - Then ... - But not on this train . In your subconscious , you substituted Miss Froy for Madam Kummer . but I did n't . I could n't have actually I talked to her here . An English lady saw her . If this lady would n't mind ... Bon , apr ? s vous , madame . What a gift for languages the fellow 's got . Would you tell us , is this the woman you saw ? It is n't a bit like her , is it ? - Yes , she 's the woman . - It is n't , I tell you . Are you sure ? - Perfectly . - She is n't , she is n't . Come on , then . I 'm so sorry to have troubled you . Well ? Are n't you going to say anything ? - You might at least gloat , if nothing else . - You only did it to save
zone1	it in her face . They 're all lying , but why ? Why do n't you sit down ? take it easy Do you think I substituted Miss Froy 's face for Madam Kummer 's ? - I think a change 'd be an improvement . - Miss Froy was on this train and nothing will convince me otherwise . Must you follow me round like a pet dog ? Let 's say a watchdog , I 've got all the better instincts . Goodbye . The doctor was right , I never saw Miss Froy on the train . I 'm glad you 're gon na take it like that . Forget all about it . Make your mind a complete blank . Watch me , you ca n't go wrong . - What about something to eat ? - Anything . - that's rite come along Would you like a little air ? - Thanks . - Can you eat anything ? - I could try . - that's the spirit You 'll feel a different girl tomorrow . - I hope so . I do n't
zone1	Your what ? I 'm being married on Thursday . - Quite sure you 're not imagining that ? - Positive . Oh , I was afraid so . Ah , food . - I could n't face it . - Mind if I talk with my mouth full ? - If you must . - Care to hear about my early life ? - I do n't think so . - Well then , I 'll begin with my father . you know It 's remarkable how many great men began with their father . Drink ? - A cup of tea , please . My father was a very colourful character and he was strongly addicted to ... You 'll never guess ? - Harriman 's Herbal Tea . - No ! Double scotch . - A million Mexicans drink it . - Maybe but Father did n't . Miss Froy gave the waiter a packet of it . - A packet of what ? - Harriman 's Herbal Tea . We agreed you 'd make your mind a complete blank . - But it 's so real
zone1	or did we not ? We did . Sorry . Go on telling me about your father . My father was a very remarkable man . - Did he play the clarionet ? - He did . He never put it down unless it was absolutely necessary . I could n't help inheriting his love of music . - Why not ? - It was all he left me . You know , you 're remarkably attractive . Has anyone ever told you ? We were discussing you . - Yes , of course . Do you like me ? - Not much . After I 'd paid my father 's debts , I started to travel , until they tried to cash the cheques . I 'm writing a book now . Would you like to buy a copy ? I 'd love to . When will it be out ? About four years . - That 's a very long time . - It 's a very long book . Do you know why you fascinate me ? I 'll tell you . You have got two qualities
zone1	at all and you 're always seeing things . - What 's the matter ? - Look . - It 's gone ! - What 's gone ? Miss Froy 's name on the window . you saw it You must have seen it ! She is on the train Now , steady , steady . We 've got to find her . Something 's happening to her . Stop the train . Listen everybodyThere 's a woman on this train - Miss Froy . They 're hiding her somewhere . I appeal to you to stop the train . Please help me . Make them stop the train . Why do n't you do something before it 's too late ? - Please . - You think I 'm crazy but I 'm not . For heaven 's sake Stop this train ! Leave me alone . - Leave me alone ! Huh ! Ten minutes late thanks to that fool of a girl . She gets up to any more tricks , we 'll be too late for the match . - I suppose you could n't put
zone1	just do n't vanish and so forth . - She has . - What ? Vanished . - Who ? - The old dame . - Yes . - Well . - Well , how could she ? - What ? - Vanish . - I do n't know . That explains my point . People do n't disappear into thin air . - It 's done in India . - What ? - The rope trick . - Oh , that . It never comes out in a photograph . Look , in half an hour we 'll stop at Morshkan , just before the border . I will leave there with my patient for the National Hospital . If you come with me , you can stay overnight in a private ward . - You need rest . - Sorry , nothing doing . Is n't there anything we can do ? Yes . Find Miss Froy . I tell you , if she does not rest , I will not answer for her . You persuade her , she likes you . I 'm as popular as
zone1	sugar , she may swallow it . Cosmopolitan trains . People of all nations . I 've just seen at least a million Mexicans in the corridor . I thought I 'd look in to tell you to think over what Dr Hartz said . If you fell like changing your mind , I 'll be hanging around . - What 's all the mystery ? - Miss Froy is on this train . I 've just seen that packet of tea in the rubbish . - She may be dead now . - Dead or ... For sheer variety , give me an English summer ... We 'll search the train . There 's something definitely queer here . Looks like a supply service for trunk murderers . Look at that ! - All right , Miss Froy , it 's only us . - Hurry up . Perhaps it 's Miss Froy bewitched ! I refuse to be discouraged . Faint heart never found old lady . - Do you know anything about her ? - No . Only that she was a governess going back home .
zone1	. There might be something down here . - What on earth ... ? - Our Italian friend . I 've got it ! Wait a minute . There you are , the Great Doppo . - His visiting card , look . - What 's it say ? Magician , illusionist , mind-reader see his fascinating act , the vanishing ... lady . - The vanishing lady ? - Perhaps that 's the explanation . - What ? - He 's practising on Miss Froy . - Perhaps it 's a publicity stunt . - No . What about the Baroness and Madame Kummer ? - What 's your theory ? - I do n't know . My theory ? I 'll tell you . Oh , dear ! I ca n't get ... - Where are you ? - In here . With a smell of camphor ball . - I ca n't see you . - I 'm about somewhere . - Here I am . Where are you ? - I do n't know . This is what comes of not saying abracadabra . - Ooh
zone1	on , out of it . - Not much . - Come and sit down . - What is that ? In magic circles , we call it the disappearing cabinet . - You get inside and you vanish . - So I noticed . You were about to tell me of your theory . Oh , my theory . Well ... my theory , my dear Watson , is that we are in very deep waters indeed . - Ahem . - Oh ! Thank you very much . Let us marshal our facts over a pipe full of shag . A little old lady disappears , everyone who saw her insists she was never there , right ? - Right . - We know that she was , therefore they did see her and so are lying . - Why ? - I do n't know . I 'm only Watson . Do n't bury yourself in the part . They dare n't face an enquiry as Miss Froy 's still on this train . - I told you that hours ago . - Yes , so you
zone1	. - Ooh , thank you . only onething we got to do we must search the train in disguise . - As what ? Well , er ... - English gentleman . - They 'd see through you . Perhaps you 're right . Aha ! Will Hay . Now , boys , boys , which of you has stolen Miss Froy ? Own up ! - Give those glasses to me . - Why ? - They 're Miss Froy's . - Are you sure ? Yes . Where did you find them ? - Down here . The glass is broken . - Probably in the struggle . Do you realise that this is our first piece of tangible proof ? That 's the lot . Will you please give me those spectacles ? They belong to me . Please . - Are you sure ? - Datemi questi occhiali ! Naughty , naughty . That 's a large nose for a small pair of spectacles . That 's the game , is it ? We 'll see about that . They 're Froy 's glasses and
zone1	know that too . Do n't stand there hopping about , kick him , see if he 's got a false bottom . Hang on , I 'll get him up . Ow ! That does n't help . Quick , pull his ears back . Give them a twist . Now I 've got him . He 's got a knife . Get hold of it before he cuts a slice off me . I ca n't reach it . Aah ! Well done , that 's it . That 's it . We know how that thing works , come out of there . Is he out ? We 've got to hide him somewhere . - What 's in here ? - Hurry up , quick , before he comes to . It 's empty . We can lock it . Come on . - Oh , no , you don't . - What 's the matter ? Garlic . I 'll be all right in a minute . - Here , let 's tie him up . - Oh , yes . So we definitely know
zone1	in here had something to do with it . That ought to keep him quiet till we find her . Hard work but worth it . Let 's have the evidence . - Evidence ? - The glasses . - You 've got them . - No , I have n't got them . - Oh ! - He 's got them . He is n't there ! Snookered ! It 's a false bottom . - The twister ! He 's a contortionist . - He 's gone . To find the others . We ca n't fight the whole train , we need allies . - But who can we trust ? - That 's the snag . There 's that Dr Hartz person . Yes , you 're right . Let 's show him the symptoms . Oh , wait a minute . This is the one . He 's not there . Listen ... I 've just had a particularly idiotic idea . - I can believe that . - Supposing that patient is Miss Froy . It did n't come on the train till after
zone1	Come on , let 's find the doctor . - No , wait a minute . - What is it ? Notice anything wrong about that nun ? - No . I do n't think she 's a nun , they do n't wear high heels . Yes , you 're right . Did you see Madame Kummer get on the train ? - No . - Well ... supposing they decoyed Miss Froy into the luggage van and hid her , the first stop , a patient comes aboard , all wrapped up , the patient is Madame Kummer , she becomes Miss Froy , Miss Froy becomes that . But why go to all this trouble to kidnap a harmless governess ? Maybe it is n't a governess at all . Perhaps it 's some political thing . Let 's investigate . Parlez vous fran ? ais ? Sprechen Sie Deutsch ? You 'll just have to cope with English . Can we look at your patient ? Thank you . Keep an eye on the nun . What are you doing here ? Why are you in
zone1	you have no business to be here . leave her view Dr Hartz , we want you to Undo bandages and to look at your patient 's face . Are you out of your senses ? There is no face there . Nothing but lumps of raw flesh . that is the case He has lost so much blood only a transfusion can save him . - Do You want me to murder my patient ? - You 're sure this is your patient ? - We believe it 's Miss Froy . - Miss Froy ! You ca n't be serious ? Whatever put such ideas into your head ? - I understand she 's deaf and dumb . - But she may lip-read . It 's possible . In that case , perhaps you 'll join me in the dining car . I 'll be with you in a moment , I want to be sure my patient has n't been disturbed . How do I know how they cottoned on ? Somebody must have tipped ' em off . You never said the old girl was English
zone1	moments I shall order three drinks in the dining car . Mine will be chartreuse . One of the stewards is working for us , now , listen.carefully There 's that girl again . Seems to have recovered . Lucky it blew over . Now , tell me what this is all about . Have you ever seen your patient ? No . I just had a message to operate at Morshkan . - How do you know it 's not Miss Froy ? - We believe it 's a substitution . - You really think ... that someone else - tararar umm ... Oh , I want a green chartreuse . - Wo n't you join me ? - Thanks . A large brandy . - And you ? - I do n't want anything . - Come on . - No , really . It 'll pick you up . All right , just a small one . Two brandies and a chartreuse . Do you know anything about the nun who 's looking after your patient ? Nun ! , No , only that she 's from
zone1	's peculiar that she 's wearing high-heeled shoes . Oh , is she ? That is rather curious , is n't it ? It 's a conspiracy . All these people on the train say they have n't seen Miss Froy but they have .. , we know that , because just now in the luggage van .. She 's off again . Hope she does n't create another scene . Put the lid on our getting back in time . ... and then this fella Doppo came and grabbed the glasses . Yeah , we had a bit of a fight . - Oh , a fight ? - We knocked him out . Oh ! - He 's made a speedy recovery . - Yes . All that 's just bluff . - Here . - Grazie . How could he be involved in a conspiracy ? Look at the poor fellow , he 's just a harmless traveller . - He 's also a music-hall artist on tour . - Well ? The baroness 's husband is Minister of Propaganda , he can cancel his tour .
zone1	stewards do n't behave , they have a cosy brick wall to run up against . B-But tell me about the English travellers , they denied seeing her . Just British diplomacy , never climb a fence if you can sit on it . I ca n't understand why anyone would want to dispose of the old lady . That 's what stumps us but she was on this train and now she 's ... gone . Well ... if you 're right then the whole train is against us . What are we going to do ? In view of what you just told me , I-I shall risk examining the patient . - Come on ... - One moment . We must n't act suspicious , behave as is if nothing had happened . A drink , that 'll steady your nerve . To our health . And may our enemies , if they exist , be unconscious of our purpose . Let 's go , we must hurry now . Come on , drink up . Wait in here . Go on . - Anything wrong ?
zone1	heels . However , it makes no difference . We shall reach Morshkan in three minutes . Quite an eventful journey . Well ? Yes , the patient is Miss Froy . She will be taken off the train at Morshkan . She will be removed to the hospital and operated on . Unfortunately , the operation will not be successful . Oh , I should perhaps have explained . The operation will be performed ... by me . You see , I am in this conspiracy , as you term it . You are a very alert young couple but it 's quite useless to think of a way out of your dilemma . The drinks you had just now . I regret to say contained a quantity of hydrocin . FYI , It is a little-known drug which has the effect , in a small quantity , of paralysing the brain and rendering the victim unconscious for considerable period . In a slightly larger quantity , of course , it induces madness . However , you have my word the dose was a normal one . In a
zone1	I say how sorry I am having to take such a ... How shall I say ? Melodramatic course . But your persistent meddling made it necessary . - Are you all right ? You fainted . - Did I ? Listen ! There is a woman next door is going to be murdered and we 've got to go before this stuff takes effect . I read that if you keep going , you can stay awake . Right . Let 's get going . It 's locked . We ca n't go that way , we 'll be spotted . - You ca n't do that ! - Do n't worry , it 's only next door . You stand on your head , touch ur toes , anything , only , whatever you do , do n't fall asleep . Go on , you need n't be afraid , it is Miss Froy . You have n't been drugged . He told me to put something in your drink but I did n't . Who the devil are you ? He said you are deaf dumb Never
zone1	, you 've got to hurry . Hartz will be back in a min , what will happen then ? If we can hold him off till get past Morshkan , the frontier 's a few miles beyond the station . Come on , there 's still time . - 500 solamente ? Dopo tutto quello che ho fatto ? Cosa poi di questo orecchio mozzicato da quella ragazza ? That 's Morshkan . Have you finished ? Come on , Miss Froy . Cut it out , you 're not drugged . I 'll explain later . Abracadabra . Miss Froy ! Oh , I ca n't believe it ! - Thank you , my dear . Thank you . - Careful . - Ready ? - Yes . Are you all right miss Froy ? Yes . thankyou It 's like rush hour on the underground . Careful , it 's slowing down . Drat . I 'm sorry you 've had such an uncomfortable journey , Miss Froy . Get back on the train . I hope nothing goes wrong . Are n't we stopping rather a
zone1	be off soon . In a few minutes we 'll be over the border . No , I 've been well-paid but this was murder and she was an English woman . - You are Bandrikan ? - My husband was . I 'm English . You were going to butcher her in cold blood Your little diversion made it necessary not only to remove the lady but two others as well . You ca n't do that . Also , it would be unwise of us to permit the existence of anyone who can not be trusted . - You would n't dare . I know too much . - Precisely . I think we 're over the border now . - You can come out , Miss Froy . - Oh , bless me . What an unpleasant journey . Never mind . You shall have a corner seat for the rest of the way . There you are.Now it 's over , I think you should tell us what it 's all about . - What was that scream ? - It was only the train .
zone1	rumbled . We 're on a branch line . Oh , dear , dear . Who are you and why do they want you ? I have n't the faintest idea . I 'm a governess . I can only think that They 've made a terrible mistake . Why are you holding out on us ? Tell us the truth . You might at least trust us . I really do n't kn ... I ... - I wonder if there 's anyone on the train . - There 's only the dining car in front . What time is it ? Teatime . Well , all the English will be there . Come on , we 'd better stick together . There 's the old girl turned up . Told you it was a lot of fuss about nothing . Bolt must have jammed . I 've got something to say . will you all please listen ? An attempt was made to abduct this lady by force and I believe the people who did it will try again . - What 's he drivelling about ? -
zone1	to branch line . - What are you talking about ? - We 're telling you the truth ! I 'm not interested . You 've annoyed us enough already on ridiculous stuff You 've got the wrong end of the stick . - Things like that just do n't happen . - We 're not in England now . - I do n't see what difference that makes . - We 're stopping . See those cars ? They 're here to take Miss Froy away . Nonsense . Look , there go a couple of people . The car 's come to pick them up . - In that case Then why the trouble of uncoupling the train and diverting it ? - Uncoupling ? - There 's no train after the sleeping car . - Our bags are in first class . Not any longer . Like to come and look ? If this is a practical joke , I do nt think it 's not very funny . Good Lord ! Get some brandy . You do n't suppose there 's something in his story ,
zone1	After all , people do n't tie up nuns . Thank you . Someone 's coming . They ca n't harm us , we 're British subjects . I have come to offer the most sincere apologies . An extremely serious incident has occurred - an attempt was made to interfere with passengers on this train . - The authorities were notified so if you 'll accompany me to Morshkan , I will inform the British Embassy . The cars are at your disposal . We 're grateful . Lucky some of you fellows understand English . - Well , I was at Oxford . - So was I . What year ? This woman 's trying to say something . I do n't understand the language . would you ? That 's fixed him . - What the blazes did you do that for ? - I was at Cambridge . - You heard what he said ? I heard what she said - It 's a trick to get us off the train . I do n't believe it . The man 's explanation was quite satisfactory .
zone1	'm going outside . It 's up to us to apologise . Wh ... Do ... - You were right . Do you mind ? - Certainly . Look as if they mean business . - Quite so , we can't do anything it 'd mean an international situation . - It 's happened . - They 're coming . - Do n't let them in ! They 'll murder us . They can't let us go now I order you to surrender at once . Nothing doing . Come any nearer , I 'll fire . I 've warned you . Better take cover , it 'll start soon . Nasty jam this . Do n't like the look of it . - Got plenty of ammunition ? - A whole pouch . - Duck down . - I 'm not fighting . It 's madness . It 'll be safer to protest down here . They 're trying to work around other side You 're behaving like fools . What chance have we got ? You heard what the mother superior said - we surrender and we 're
zone1	. - Give it to me . Give it to me ! - No . - What 's going on ? - He 's got a gun and he wo n't use it . - What 's the idea ? - told this I wo n't be a party to this . - I do n't believe in fighting . - Pacifist , eh ? Wo n't work . Hand it over . I 'm not afraid to use it . I 'm probably more used to it . I once won a box of cigars . He 's talking rot , he 's a damn good shot . You know , I 'm half-inclined to believe ... that there 's some rational explanation to all this . Rotten ! Only knocked his hat off . Would you mind if I talked to you for a minute ? - What , now ? - Yes , forgive me but it 's very important . - Hang on to this , will you ? - All right . I think it 's safer along here . You come , too .
zone1	getting along now . - You ca n't ! You 'll be shot down . - I must take that risk . - Listen carefully . In case I 'm unlucky , I want you to take back a message to Mr Callender at the Foreign Office . - You are a spy . - That 's such a grim word . - What is the message ? - It 's a tune . - A tune ? - It contains , in code , the vital clause of a secret pact between two countries . I want you to memorise it . The first part goes like this . - # Da-da-da da , da-da de ... # Oh ! Perhaps I 'd better write it down . - got any paper ? It 's OK , I was brought up on music . - Very well . # Da-da-da da , da-da de ... # - The old girl 's off her rocker . - No wonder . Why do n't you face it ? They 'll kill the lot of us . For goodness ' sake ,
zone1	's right . Now we have two chances . You will remember it ? I wo n't stop whistling it . - This is my best way out . - Yes , just about . Even if you do get away , they 'll stop you at the frontier . - We ca n't let her go like this . - It 's a hell of a risk you are taking In this job , one must take risks . I 'm very grateful to you both for all you 've done . I hope pray no harm comes to you and that we shall meet again one day . I hope so , too . Good luck . Good Luck . - Will you help me out ? Now , you take the weight on top . Right you are . Goodbye . - Was she hit ? - I 'm not sure . Well , that 's the end of my 12 . Not much left here either . We 've only got one chance - get this train going . Try and get back to the main
zone1	n't do what you tell them . - We 'll bluff them . Who 's coming ? - count on Me . - Me , too . We ca n't all go . You carry on here . If we have any luck , we 'll stop at the points then you can switch them over . You idiots . You 're just inviting death . I 've had enough . Just because I 've the sense to try and avoid being murdered , I 'm accused of being a pacifist . All right . rather be called a rat than die like one . Think for a moment . If we give ourselves up , they 're bound to give us a trial . Stop it . Nobody 's listening to you . Very well , you go your way ... I 'll go mine . - Where are you off to ? - To do the sensible thing . Oh , let the fellow go . I do n't understand ... Oh , please ... Why are n't we going ? They said we were going , why
zone1	away . Only one left . I 'll keep that for a sitter . They 're moving away from car and coming towards us . Pity we have n't a few more rounds . It 's funny , I told my husband when I left him that I would n't see him again . Gilbert . Gilbert ! - We 're off ! - Gilbert came through ! Go on , keep going . - Do you know how to control this thing ? - I watched him start it . I know a bit about it . Once drove a miniature engine . Good . I 'll look out for the points . The blighters are chasing us . We ca n't have far to go . Time for my little job - changing the points . That will not be necessary . I am sorry but the points will not be changed over . Will you please be seated ? There they are , just ahead of us . Do you think you can stop it ? Hope so . Keep still until my friends arrive . -

Alrite Where 's Charters ? - Go ahead , she 's done it . It 's all right , it 's just my leg . Or as they say in English , " Jolly good luck to them . " I 'm glad all that 's over , are n't you ? Heaven knows what the government will say about this . - Nothing . They 'll hush it up . - What ? Hey , take your hand off it , I 've got to remember a tune . - Remember ... - Porter , sir ? - No , thanks . - Well , we 're home , Gilbert . Ca n't you stop humming that awful tune ? I 'm not taking any risks . - Charles be here to meet you ? - I expect so . Hm . - You 'll be busy before Thursday . -

( groans ) - Then you 're all ready to go ? - Yes . - Why did n't they go an hour ago ? - They might 've heard from them . - I knew something like this 'd happen . - Do n't worry , they 're excellent skiers .

Karen 'd be compromised , and I 'm engaged to her . Think of my position . I am thinking , and it is n't of your position . Get going . This might turn into a calamity any minute .

I 'll go to bed . - Good night . - Good night ! So you think it 's funny , huh ? You would n't have fun like this if you married ... someone else .

Nice little horse , ai n't he , Doc ? - Remember me ? - Where 's Mr . Garrett ? I sent him home . How ' bout you and me having a little talk ? I do n't believe in talk , unless the other fella holds all the cards . Sonny , that head of yours sure is screwed on tight . If it was n't , somebody would have knocked it off long ago . I guess that 's right . How did you know Pat was gon na hit you out there ? Well , it 's the first time a sheriff ever wanted to shake hands with me . - He heard you say " shake hands . " - Huh ? How do you do , Mr . Horse ? I 'm pleased to meet you . I 'll swear , I did

That 's all right , Doc . You 've got the right to choose your friends . Shucks . I do n't take kindly to that at all . He knows there 's no stage until tomorrow ... and he knows that I 'm afoot .

You sure ? - It 's too bad I did n't know . - What ? - He was your brother . - What 's that got to do with it ? Well , maybe I would n't have tried so hard to get the other girl .

Have you really got 20 notches in your gun ? Is it true you got 13 Indian scalps in your war bag ? Had to throw ' em away . The moths got to them . Tanning ' em the best way to keep them . - Is that a fact ? - That 's what my pa told me . - What are you doing with that ? - Trying get bark off to make a whistle . - Have you sucked it ? - I sucked it till it near dry .

Thanks . - Glad to help . - Anything I can do , let me know . - That 's a new one on me . - What ? Aiming before you draw . - I 've got to . - Why ? My hand seems to be a little quicker than my eye . Well , ai n't that too bad . - Where 'd you get the horse ? - I bought this one . - Looks all right . - He 'll do for the time being . Ham and eggs . Fry the eggs on both sides . I 'll take the same . Mine straight up . How ' bout a cold hand while we 're waiting ? How much ? - How 's that ? - Suits me . Before you get started

And I do n't like him any better than you do . Oh , Garrett , eh ? The name sounds familiar . - Figure on staying in town tonight ? - Why ? Everybody knows that Garrett told you to get out of town . Sooner or later you 're gon na have a little trouble with him . I thought I might give you a hand . That 's very kind of you , mister . Listen . I ai n't doing you no favor . It 'll be a pleasure . Now what I figure is when he 's arguing with you , he wo n't watch anyone else . So , it 'll be a cinch for me . Be careful you do n't knock me over with the same bullet . Do n't worry . I 'll stand at an angle .
zone1	is Garrett there . And if you 're standing about where you are ... why , I 'll be over here . Do you mind if I draw my gun so you can see the line of fire ? No , go right ahead . - It 's me , Billy . - Come on in , Doc . - What happened ? - He 's a pretty smart hombre . You know him ? He 's been hanging around trying to talk Garrett into making him a deputy . I guess he figured if he got Billy he 'd be a hero ... he could have the deputy job , or run for governor if he wanted it . - Better get out of here , son . - Why ? He pulled on me first . - Be hard to make Garrett believe that . - We 'll see . Where 's my dough ? Well , I guess I must 've picked it up . You 're foolish to stick around , son . I think I 'd be more foolish to pull out . Then Garrett
zone1	. Cut for deal . - You meant you want to play poker . - That 's right . You 're not worried about me if I tangle with Garrett , are you ? Fights pretty good . I know him better than you do . All right , if he 's so good ... then you 'll get your horse back , wo n't you ? Say , I never thought of that . What 's the matter ? Nothing . - Lend me a hundred . - I never lend money in a poker game . Spoils my luck . But I 'd be glad to have you put up the horse for a hundred . I guess you would . Hello , Pat . Care for a bite to eat , boys ? A little hand of poker ? No thanks , Doc . Were you in there when it happened ? No . But listen , Pat , he pulled on Billy first . - How do you know ? - His gun was on the floor . That do n't prove nothing . Pat ,

Doc , I 'm gon na give you a chance to stay out of this . - Thanks . - Your horse is outside . Get on him . - Good luck to you . - Same to you . What are you waitin ' for ? He 's waiting for those chickens of yours to hatch . Are you gon na put up a fight ? I 'll tell you one thing . I ai n't going to jail for no killing I was pushed into . - Thanks , Doc . - What are you trying to do ? I still think that fella pulled first on Billy . Are you throwing off on me again ? Then what do you call it ? Since I figure that this is a personal matter between you and Billy ... I do n't think you ought to bring in all this hired help . I only
zone1	... so I would n't have to kill him . Do you stuff birds too ? You 're making a big mistake ... turning on an old friend , all because of a little snip ... who 's never given anybody nothing except the back of his hand . Speaking of hands ... Come on . Let 's get out of here before this hothead makes us plug him . He ai n't gon na run me out of town . If you wan na hold the fort while I ride off on your little horse ... it 's all right with me . Well , since you put it that way . Go ahead , son . Take it easy , Pat . Doc , this finishes you and me for good and all . I 'm sorry . - Can you get up , son ? - I do n't know . - Can you make it to the horse ? - I think so . Did you see what that little horse did , pulling me out like that ? He 's a regular bird dog .
zone1	I 'm all right . Charlie , you better stay here and have a look around town . That kid 's got a bullet in him . He ai n't going far . Let 's go . Who 's that ? Quit that yelling . Get these horses out of sight . This is Billy the Kid . He got a bad one on the left side ... but the bullet did n't hit anything vital and it came out in the back . Do n't move him at all or the bleeding will start again . I guess you better cut his clothes off . Put a bandage on the wound and see that it 's always moist . Keep him warm and dry . If he gets a chill , he 's a goner . If he goes out of his head , tie him down . The neighbors hear him yelling , tell them your aunt has smallpox . That 'll keep them away . I guess that 's all . Now do your best for this boy . If I ca n't come back , I
zone1	bring you along . Shoo , shoo ! Face like a baby . He 's so hot . He 's no hotter than your brother Julio was . He 's soaking wet again . Get me some sheets , Aunt Guadalupe . Get them yourself . - What 's the matter with you ? - I would n't lift a finger for him . What 's the matter ? - Been lookin ' for him around here . - Well , ai n't that too bad . Chico , what 's the matter with you ? He smells the blood . He was just getting ready to peck his eyes out . You stay out of here . - Your name McDonald ? - What do you wan na know for ? Why do n't you wan na tell me ? - Yes , that 's my name . Why ? - Your father 's name is ... Woodruff . Charlie Woodruff . I used to work for him when he was Tom Motsacoro . Oh , yes . I guess I was a little girl then . - Charlie
zone1	- Very well . Thank you . You 're getting fat as a pig . - What are you doing up here ? - I 've been working with the sheriff . We 're looking for Billy the Kid . You get out of here ! - Come in and sit down . - Some other time . I 'll drop in the first chance I get . - What 's wrong with that bird ? - Nothing . I have a hen sitting under the bed and he likes to peck at her . - Want me to get him out of there ? - No . Everything 's all upset in there . We just got up . Good-bye . I 'm glad to have seen you . Same here . So long , Aunt Guadalupe . - I 'll walk down a ways with you . - No , you wo n't . Lunch is all ready . Good-bye . I 'll fix you . How 's Billy ? Looks like he 's having a chill . A chill ? Where are you ? Right here .

How can you stop a thing like this ? - You 're mad at me . - No . - Yes , you are . - No , I 'm not . - Why do you hide from me ? - I 'll be right back . - Where 's that bottle of whiskey ? - I finished it . The time I had that bad cough . I fired those hot stones for Julio , but it was just the same . He shook like a leaf till he died . You get out of here and shut the door . What ? Just get out of here . Have you gone crazy ? You can bring the minister tomorrow if it 'll make you feel better about it . Now get out . You 're not gon na die . I 'll get you warm .

I want to have a look around . What for ? I ca n't spend
zone1	I want to see if I can find my ring . Your ring ? Yeah . I had a ring on this finger and it 's gone . I 've been worried about it . You must n't be upset about a thing like that . You can get another one , ca n't you ? This one 's been kind of lucky for me . It belonged to a fellow who was supposed to have had a charmed life ... as long as he kept it on his finger . Then how did you get it ? Did you kill him ? No . Somebody else did that . Then the ring was n't so lucky for him after all , was it ? Well , nothing happened to him until he took it off to wash his hands . No , you better not get up till tomorrow . - You said that yesterday . - You 're not strong enough yet . Who says I 'm not ? Billy , you must n't . You 'll hurt yourself . Then why do n't you quit wrestling with

What if somebody should come by ... like that deputy sheriff friend of yours the other day ? Yes , that 's right . I 'll go tell Aunt Guadalupe . - Who is it ? - It 's me , Doc . Hurry up ! Open this door here . Coming . Hello , Doc . Glad to see you , Doc ! You 'd never know it . I thought I 'd have to break the door down . It 's the rain , Doc . I could n't hear a thing , Doc .

You made enough noise now to raise the dead . So that 's it ? All right , where is he ? He 's getting dressed . Maybe I better give him a hand . No , Doc ! Please let me talk to you first ! What got into you ? Were you drunk ? What happened to you ? I do n't know . He 's a devil . He did the same to me . He can charm a bird right out of a bush . - I never saw it to fail
zone1	you want me to say ... bless you , my children ? You might as well . Huh ? I 'm married to him . You 're what ? That 's the truth , Doc . Only please do n't tell him . Tell who ? Billy . - You mean he does n't know it ? - No . Then how could you be married to him ? He was out of his mind . I never would have done it , only I thought he was gon na die . And so he would have , if it had n't been for you . I do n't want his gratitude . Guess I should 've stayed out in the rain with the sheriff . - Make me a cup of coffee . - Sure . It 's a good thing you do n't want his gratitude . Why do you say that ? You know , when I come to think of it ... after what you done to me , I could n't wish you anything better ... than you hooking up with Billy . What do
zone1	for you . Hello , Doc . Is that all you got to say to me ? Now look here , Doc , I 'm sorry , but it 's your own fault . Oh , my fault , huh ? Who brought me here ? Now you want to switch the blame on me . First you take my horse , then my girl ... and both times it 's all my fault . That reminds me of something else . You ran away with Red , did n't you ? You think that 's any excuse ? It was good enough for me . - There 's only one trouble with it . - What 's that ? The horse was mine too . I was n't in much shape to argue that with you , was I ? No , I guess you were n't . But you did n't have use for that horse lying flat on your back , or did you ? All right , Doc , if that 's your way of looking at it . You just took the loan of him
zone1	? Yes , that 's what I 'd like to know . You borrow from me ... I borrow from you . What does that mean ? Let 's have a cup of java . We better be getting out of here . Not at those prices . All right , Doc , I 'll tell you what I 'll do . What 's that ? Well , just to show you my heart 's in the right place ... I 'll let you take your pick . Huh ? You mean you 'd trade me for a horse ? It 's up to Doc . After all , I 've got to think of the other fellow , you know . I appreciate that . I sure do . Billy , you do n't mean that . And after all she did for you . Say , you should have seen what that little horse did for me , huh , Doc ? That 's right . I hope you wo n't think too hard of me ... but under the circumstances ... I 'm going to take the
zone1	satisfied ? Listen , Doc , I like that little horse . What 'd I tell you , huh ? - I still ca n't believe it . - What are you talking about ? - Nothing . - What 's eating you ? Nothing ! Here . Fill these with fresh water . The creeks are muddy as all get out . How about grub ? Can you spare enough flour and bacon to get us to Fort Sumner ? Sure . Hey , it 's clearing up . We better be getting out of here . Lend me some dough , will you ? How much do you want ? About 50 bucks . Here 's 40 . Here . Buy yourself a horse and buggy . Do n't you think it 's too much ? You can give Aunt Guadalupe 20 if you want . If we get located in Fort Sumner , I 'll send for you . What for ? I ca n't stand ranch cooking . Here you are . - Thanks . Good-bye . - Bye , Doc . Bye , lollipop .
zone1	do the same . Fill these up for Doc . Hello , you old hay bag . Have ya missed me ? He 's thin as a rail . He 's been getting a little exercise . Where 'd you get that plug ? Wore out the black horse I had , so I traded him to sheep herder for this one . He 's all right . Little wild yet . Come on . Ai n't Red a sweetheart ? I 'm going to let you have a loan of him for a little while . - Until you get your strength back . - You 're not gon na do me any favors . - What 's the matter with you ? - I do n't wan na be obligated about Red . - Why not ? - I 'm not giving up on getting him back ... anymore than I 've given up getting on this ornery goat . Bye , Rio . - What 's the matter ? - Boy , am I tuckered . - What are you lookin ' for ? - A sink
zone1	you do n't cotton to ? - I guess I forgot . - Yeah , it 's a bad habit you got . - What ? - Forgettin ' what belongs to others . - You think I did it on purpose ? - Yes . - Listen , I do n't feel good as it is . - Neither do I . You wan na make something out of it ? - That 's a big advantage you 're taking . - I ca n't help it . I 'm so plumb beat out , I 'll be lucky if I can draw ' em clear . I do n't want to crowd a sick man . I 'm all right . Just give me 40 winks and I 'll take ya with both hands free . I guess this is as good a place as any to make camp . There 's no water . And you wo n't find any between here and Fort Sumner . That 's a long ways off . When we get there our friend , the sheriff , wo n't be far
zone1	it 's him ? I can tell him farther off than that . He would n't be coming after the two of us alone . Maybe he 's lost too many of his friends . How come you did n't knock him over ? Or did you try ? - Did I ? - That 's what I said . Did ya ? Did n't do nothin ' else . Who do you suppose put him on our trail ? Well , maybe somebody saw us pulling out or ... Or what ? Nothing . - Sure , she was the one . - Yeah , Rio . Why do you suppose she had to up and do a thing like that ? Well , women are funny . Go easy on that water . We 've only got two canteens to get us to Fort Sumner . What 's the matter ? Look ! Sweet spirited miter . The little darling put sand in it instead of water . That sure is one for the book . Well , no use hanging ' round here till morning . Let
zone1	think I 'll have another drink . What are you talking about ? You did n't have one in the first place . No , but I had the same notion about an hour ago . I know what you 're thinking , but it wo n't do you any good . - Take my advice . - What ? Killing a woman . - Why not ? - They 're all alike . There is n't anything they would n't do for you ... or to you . Hey , why did n't you wake me up ? We should 've gotten started long ago . Keep ' em up ! Hello , Pat . - Where 's Billy ? - Looks like he left ya . And on my horse , eh ? Try those on . You know me . Do I have to put these on ? I know ya . Put ' em on ! That was pretty smart , putting sand in those canteens . I had to give you something for your money , did n't I ? Oh , I see .
zone1	, huh ? No wonder he came alone . All he had to do was take his time and wait for the sun to finish us off . Then how did you get back ? It was pretty tough ... but the more I thought about seeing you , darling ... the easier it got . Then what are you waiting for ? Go ahead . Say , that sounds real nice . I like to hear you ask for it . Keep it up . Beg some more . What would you like me to say ? Well , you might say " please " very sweetly . Please . Will you keep your eyes open ? Yes . Will you look right at me while I do it ? What is it ? Everybody drinks but me . I 'm supposed to be a camel , huh ? You want a drink , you can climb down and get it . Say , did you hear something ? - What kind of a track is that ? - I do n't know . Too small for a man
zone1	Well , take a look at that . Yeah , it 's an old Indian trick soaking rawhide in water to make it shrink . Another hour , she 'd have been hanging by her wrists . Well , I 'll say one thing for Billy . He sure does pay off poetic . He put her right where she could see the water . He just left here less than half an hour ago . He went that way , toward those mountains . - Are you all right ? Sit . - Do n't worry about me . Go after him . - We ca n't catch him now . - Why not ? He 's got too much of a head start on us . Sit down . You know , I think he 's in love with you . What are you talking about ? The crazier a man is about a woman , the crazier he thinks and does . He 's only crazy about one thing : Himself . Say , that gives me a thought . Maybe we 'll get Mr . Billy
zone1	says . If he 's crazy enough to do you like this ... maybe he 's just crazy enough to come back to turn you loose . You 're the one that 's crazy . He does n't care anything about me . He 'd never come back . Maybe so , but it 's worth trying . Ai n't it , Doc ? If he 's fool enough to come back , he ought a get himself caught . I told you not to breathe so loud . All right , all right . Well , how do you like it ? I thought I tied it tighter than that . - You came back . - Not on your account , I didn't . - You did n't ? - You see Doc and the sheriff ? Here we are , Billy , right behind ya . Now put those hands where they belong . Say , why did n't you tip me off ? Hurry up with that grub . I wan na get to town before dark . - Well , I 've only got two
zone1	' em ? - I 'll use one on you in a minute . - I would n't put it past ya . Now 's your chance with me all trussed up like a chicken . Here we are together again . Same old happy family . Yeah , and I 'd have been halfway to Fort Sumner if it had n't been for you . - Me ? - Yeah , you . Give me a cigarette . - You mean her . - Rio ! Are you out of your mind ? - Come out and admit it like a man . - Admit what ? You did n't know Pat caught me until you got back to our camp , did ya ? - Then why come after us ? - Why not ? We 'd have been clear to Lincoln before you even got back here . Say , mister , what are you trying to make out ? I heard you say once you did n't like ranch cooking ... so I guess you figured you 'd better come back and get Rio . You
zone1	to get her . - You did . - I tell you I didn't . - Actions speak louder than words . - Do they ? I 'll show you how much I care about her . If you want her back , you can have her . Now what do you think about that ? I do n't want her . - Cattle do n't graze after sheep . - Sheep ? Sheep did you say ? I did n't say goats or monkeys . Why you . Ah , sit down . - What 's the matter with you ? - None of your business ! Careful , young fella . You want it now ? I 've just been waitin ' for an excuse like this . I 'll fix you up . Never mind fixing ' any more food . We 're leavin ' now . Come on . Let me get a drink first . All right , hurry up . Hey , Rio , come here and hold my hands so I wo n't fall in . Come out of there ! You 're
zone1	taking us back to Lincoln , ai n't ya ? Where did ya think I was takin ' ya ? - It 's over that way , ai n't it ? - Sure . What are you gettin ' at ? Take a look . Hey , Doc . Well , the Mescaleros are out early this year . They 're talkin ' about us , ai n't they ? Yeah . They 're tipping ' off another hunting party that must be out . Right over there . On both sides of us . I guess our best chance is to hightail it to Fort Sumner . Do n't figure on me doing much hightailing . - Why not ? - I ai n't no acrobat . I hope you fellas have sense enough to behave yourselves . Sure , Pat , certainly . Sure , Pat . No , ya do n't ! - That 's your horse over there . - Who says so ? I say so . Get on him and hurry up . Rio , you ride the paint . Thanks . Hey ,
zone1	but I 'm gon na ride him . I do n't like this . Looks like some of those Mescaleros are ahead of us too . No , you better not come over here , Rio . - Why not ? - They put the fire on them . Those Mescaleros sure do play for keeps . Say , what 's that ? It 's a good size party . We 'll be knee-deep in them in a minute . Look over there too . - Hey , what are ya doin ' ? - What do ya think ? I want my gun . Now wait a minute . You 're not gon na argue at a time like this . Are n't you gon na give us a chance ? He 'd like to see them put the fire on me . - I sure would . - What about her ? We ca n't talk about it now . I want to know one thing . Do I have your solemn promise that you 'll give them back when I ask ? - Sure . What do
zone1	it that he does ? Who 's gon na see to it that I do ? I 'll take your word for it . - Where are my cartridges ? - Here you are . Now what do we do ? Make a stand or run for it ? - Ca n't make a stand here . - I know something that might work . - What is it ? - Come on . Do exactly what I do . Cut him loose ! I know this place . We 're about 40 miles from Fort Sumner . Senor Garrett , what are you doing out this late ? Hello , Pablo . Can you put us up for the night ? Sure , glad to have you . Come right in . My house is yours . I 'll take care of the horses . Well , boys , I guess we 're out of the woods now , huh ? Yeah . Yeah , that 's right . I would n't be too sure of that , Pat . Oh , yes , he 's right , Pat
zone1	This is very important . I want you to ride to Fort Sumner ... and give this note to the town marshal . Did he say " town marshal " ? That 's what it sounded like to me . Thanks , Rio . It certainly is a beautiful night out . I think I 'll take a little stroll . And , gentlemen , just in case I should n't return before you retire ... I 'll say good night now . I think I 'll go with ya . Well , Billy , you 've been pretty good to my little horse . I guess the least I can do is let you say good-bye to him . That 's awfully nice of you , Doc . Oh , I always like to think of the other fella . So if you just stand right here in this doorway ... and do n't make no warlike moves ... then you can wave farewell to ' I'm as we ride off . In other words , you think you 're gon na leave . I 'm sorry , Pat
zone1	know how it is . - Listen , Doc . - You 're wasting your time , Pat . Have n't you forgotten something ? No , I do n't think so . Good night all . Say , Doc . Yes , what is it ? I 'm afraid you 'll have to listen to me for a minute . Why ? What if I do n't feel like waving good-bye to Red ? You still think you got something to say about that horse , eh ? Yes , I do . All right , go ahead and say it . That 's a pretty big advantage to give a man like you . Did n't you tell me that once ? How 's this ? You do n't have to go that far . Thanks . What about him ? Will he leave us alone ? Or do you think we ought to pull his teeth before we start ? Do n't worry about me . I would n't lift a finger , Doc , to keep you from killing him . You and me never had
zone1	out of it . All right , son , I 'm waiting . Put those plates down . You 're makin ' me nervous . - Billy , he 'll kill ya . - What do you care ? - But you can get another horse . - I want this one . Why ? I wan na see if I can teach him to make smoke come out of his ears . Say , I have n't got all night . Get back against that wall . - But Billy ... - Go on ! And count up to three . I wo n't . You 're outta your mind , both of ya . How about you , Pat ? Sure , I 'll be glad to . You 're too willing . I do n't trust you . I think I 'd rather have that cuckoo clock do the counting for me . Yeah , that 's good enough . It 's gon na strike in a minute . Should we pull on the last cuckoo ? All right . Well , Billy , I guess this
zone1	all . Have you ever seen two kids wrestling in the yard ? They push and tussle and maybe they look like they 're fighting ... but they 're not . They 're really friends ... and everything 's in fun . Then pretty soon , they play a little too rough ... one of ' em gets mad ... and in the end , somebody always gets hurt . So for you and me , this is where somebody gets hurt . But when it 's over ... and however it turns out , son ... no hard feelings . Why did n't you draw ? Why did you change your mind ? This some trick of yours ? No , I just do n't feel like it . Maybe I ate too much . Perhaps some other night you will feel like it , eh ? Who knows ? I never wanted it , but I 've waited and let you pick ... your own time and place . You 've done that tonight . You gon na draw , or do I have to make you ?
zone1	me to nick your ears ? Doc , have you gone loco ? What 's the matter with you , Billy ? I did n't think you 'd take this off anybody . Maybe I would n't , off anybody else . What do you mean by that ? Doc , do n't listen to that kind of talk . Have n't you ever seen cold feet before ? He never had cold feet in his life . What is it , Billy ? I guess the idea about the cuckoo clock was n't so good . Why ? Well , it gave me time to think and remember a few things . You 're the only partner I ever had . Gosh , do you really feel that way , son ? - I treated you worse than anyone . - Nah , it was all my fault . - Would n't want Red carrying both of us . - Oh , do n't worry . We can find a better way than that to divide ' I'm up . Say , you can ride ' I'm outta here
zone1	right , come to think of it . I ai n't worried about you and me ever fighting now , Billy ... because one thing is certain . If we did n't do it tonight , we never will . Come on . Let 's go . So long , Pat . Do n't take any wooden nickels . You 're not going with him . Look here , you ai n't gon na start something with the two of us , are ya ? I might 've known you 'd do this to me . Ever since you met him , you 've treated me like a dog . The very first day , you sided with him against me ... and made me the laughingstock of the town ! Take it easy . I gave you your guns so you 'd have a chance for your life . And now you tell me I got ta fight the two of you to get them back . You stand there , side by side ... with that little snip of a kid against me ... me , the oldest
zone1	would be if it was n't for him ! Say , mister , that 's about enough outta you for one night . Wait a minute . You let me handle this . Pat is a friend of mine . I do n't want to kill him , and I do n't want you to kill him . Clear ? Pat , you 're just getting yourself all steamed up . I 'll be seeing you one of these days , and we 'll have a good laugh about this . Now , so long . Be careful . You know you have n't got a chance against me . Good-bye . - Say . - No , son , please , do n't do that . Oh , Doc , lie down . Why not ? That 's one thing I 've always been afraid of . - What ? - Dying in bed . Why did n't you shoot ? You had me beat by a mile . You had me cold . Maybe I do n't like cold meat . Well , go ahead . Go ahead
zone1	over Doc ? I do n't know what to say . I never said anything over anybody I killed before . I think we ought a say something over Doc . You better do it . So long , Doc . I want you to know I 'm sorry . I honestly am . Last night I was ready to kill you ... but in the daylight , I can see things much better . You and Doc have been friends for years . If I had n't come between ya , none of this would 've happened . It sure is funny ... how two or three trails can cross ... and get all tangled up . Well , go ahead . After you . Say , you do n't think I 'd shoot you in the back , do you ? I do n't know , but I ai n't gon na tempt ya . I do n't think you 'd be fool enough to try to do it from the front . You never trust anybody , do you ? I apologize , Pat . Go ahead
zone1	- He 's still in the house . - What 's he doin ' ? - He 's not gon na try to stop you . - How do you know ? - He told me so . Say , Billy , can I see you for a minute ? What do you want ? If that 's the way ya feel about it , never mind . At least I 'm not afraid to turn my back on you . Here . Hold these a minute . I thought you might like to have Doc 's guns as a keepsake . Say , I sure would . Thanks , Pat . Thanks a whole lot . I never had an extra pair . Black holsters too . They 'd go nice with Sunday clothes , if I ever get any . Do you think they 'll suit ya ? If the barrels ai n't too long . No , they 're just the same . Be careful . They 're loaded . That 's right . I think they 're better balanced than mine . Then how about letting
zone1	If I had your guns ... I could say it was you out there in that grave , instead of Doc . You 'd pass Doc off as me ? Sure . Everybody would believe me once they saw your six-shooters . You could leave an end to your trail right here . Nobody 'd follow you up north . All your troubles would be buried ... past and present . You and Rio could go off with nothing to worry about . How come you 'd do a favor like that for me ? There you go again , Billy . Distrustin ' a person who 's tryin ' to be decent to you . Do n't you realize that 's your whole trouble ? Do n't you see that 's what 's gotten you into all your fights ? You got more enemies than anybody in this part of the country . How do you expect to get along with people ... when you think every man who holds his hand out to you ... has a knife behind his back ? Son , I ... I just
zone1	. Honest , I do n't . I did n't mean anything . I 'm sorry . That 's the spirit . That 's my boy . Now give me those guns and clear out of here , before it 's too late . What 's the matter ? Nothing . But I 've had these guns a long time . I sure hate to let go of ' em . I 've been pretty patient with you . Billy , my son ... it 's your duty to give them up . You owe it to yourself . You ought to start a new life today . Those guns are the badge of your shame . They represent everything you must leave behind you . Do n't you realize that ? Do n't you understand ... that if you 're going to start all over again ... your hands must be clean ? I guess you 're right , Pat . I never thought of it like that . Thanks , Pat . Billy , you do n't know what this means to me . You 'll never forget
zone1	say that ? Why should n't I ? Why should you ? You ai n't goin ' anywhere . I took the firing pins out of those guns . Why you ... Nothing would make me happier than for you to keep coming . Is that one of your own guns ? It sure looks like it . How did you get it ? You dirty little cheat . You switched those guns on me . Of all the dirty , rotten tricks ... I did n't mean to , Pat . Honest , I did n't . They must 've gotten mixed up while I was playin ' with ' em . Thanks . I left my guns right there . What for ? Do n't you have to show them to everybody to make them believe your story ? You see , I have an idea ... that you 'd rather give Doc the credit for doing you up like this . Because I think you 'd rather be dead than have people know ... that Billy the Kid did this to ya . Good-bye , Pat .
zone1	, do you ? - Did you fill ' em up for me ? - Yes .
zone1	6510398 Two times nine is 18 . Three times nine is 27 . Four times nine is 36 . Come in , please . Here we are , Mary . I have a most painful matter to discuss with you , Mary . Your sister . Have you heard from her lately ? No , Mrs . Lowood . She does n't write often . Have you any other relatives , Mary ? - No . Jacqueline brought me up . Somehow I never felt I needed other relatives . That makes it all the more difficult . Difficult ? Has anything happened to Jacqueline ? We do n't know , Mary . We 've been unable to get in touch with your sister . Sometimes she can be quite careless . Why do n't you try Mrs . Redi ? - I 've written repeatedly to Mrs . Redi . She vouchsafes no information whatsoever . It is six months , Mary , since your tuition has been paid . Naturally , it 's impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil . Of course . - Miss Gilcrist and I have talked the matter over
zone1	younger children as sort of an assistant teacher . But , Mrs . Lowood , I ca n't just stay on here without knowing what 's happened to my sister . Maybe if I went to New York , if I saw Mrs . Redi myself ... I doubt if you 'll get anything out of that woman . But if you 'd like to try I 'll advance the money to make the trip to New York . Of course , my dear , if you do n't find your sister you can always come back here . Thank you . Mary . Do n't come back . No matter if you never find your sister . No matter what happens to you . Do n't come back . My parents died when I was a pupil . I left as you are leaving . But I did n't have courage . One must have courage to really live in the world . I came back . Gilcrist . Agnes , John Quincy Adams did not follow John Adams as president . Build thee more stately mansions , O
zone1	low-vaulted past ! Let each new temple , Nobler than the last Shut thee from heaven With a dome more vast Till thou at length art free That 's enough . It seems all right , Joseph . You see , we do keep up the quality of La Sagesse products in spite of Jacqueline 's absence . But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister . I 'm afraid not . Your sister had many friends , but they were not my friends . I was only the manager of her plant . Mrs . Redi , there 's one thing . With Jacqueline gone , how do you carry on the business ? What do you do with the receipts ? How do you sign the checks ? Why , Mary , I 'm amazed . Did n't Jacqueline tell you ? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago . It 's my business now . - I did n't know that . Yes , and I must say I 've done quite well with it . Perhaps even
zone1	of ? Old letters ? Anything that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline ? Leave your address . If I find anything , I 'll be in touch . I 'm stopping at the Chatsworth . - Thank you , my dear . Why , Mary . Hello , Frances . - How are you , honey ? How 's Miss Jacqueline ? - I do n't know . That 's why I came to see Mrs . Redi . I 'm trying to find her . You mean she 's gone and you do n't know where she is ? Come here a minute . I do n't get this . Miss Jacqueline 's so crazy about you . She always talked about you , and she had your picture in her office . I know . For the first time I 'm beginning to feel frightened . I almost feel as if I 'd never known my sister . Nothing 's happened to her . It 's just I ca n't understand her not keeping in touch with you . I ca
zone1	n't worry about it . I saw Miss Jacqueline myself about a week ago . At a restaurant the boyfriend took me to . A little Italian place down in the Village called the Dante . The Dante ? - Yes , it 's on Perry Street . Why do n't you ask the people who own the place ? They 'll remember Jacqueline . Anybody who ever sees her never forgets her . I 'll try there . I 'm sorry to bother you . I want to ask you about my sister . - Yes ? I thought you might know her . She was seen here about a week ago . Her name is Jacqueline Gibson . I do n't know no Gibson . This is a restaurant . Many people come here . - She 's very beautiful . I wish I could tell you what she looks like . I 'm sure you 'd remember her . She 's tall , with dark hair . Once you 'd seen my sister , you 'd never forget her . Maybe . - Let me look at
zone1	. Yes , if she made that much impression on you , I 'm sure it was Jacqueline . She has n't been here for a long time . But she was here ? - Oh , yes , yes . One day a beautiful car comes here . This beautiful woman in furs gets out . There is a handsome man with her , and the chauffeur . The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms and the chauffeur changes the lock on the doors . Then the lady does not come back . Not to live anyhow . She came back three or four times . But always alone . Just to eat . You mean she just came here , rented the room locked it and left ? - Yes , and pays the rent every month . Could you let me see that room ? If it is hers there might be something there to help me find my sister . No , the rent is paid . The lady asked us to promise . I wo n't open the door . - Please . It
zone1	he always wanted to see the inside of this room anyway . I tell you , when a thing like this comes up you 've got to go to the police . What do you think people pay taxes for ? It ai n't just to keep us chasing after crooks and regulating traffic . We 're supposed to help everybody . Now , you 've got to go to the police about your sister , miss . I 've had some experience with the Bureau of Missing Persons ... Yeah . Well , Mr . Hoag lost persons are the concern of the Missing Persons Bureau . You stick to your poetry . You 're the poet , Jason . Well , in a way that makes everything my business , does n't it ? Were you going to make a suggestion ? - Yes . I was going to ask you to look into your own heart . Do you really want to find your sister ? Oh , my Jason . Always laughing , always joking to help others . He 's a good boy , miss
zone1	good boy , but no one listens to what I say . Now , you do what I tell you and go to the Missing Persons Bureau for your sister . If you 'll give me the address . - Certainly . She was only 16 . - Had she ever run away before ? What did he have on when last seen ? - He went out without his hat or his coat . It 's very cold for such an old man . Any identifying marks or characteristics ? Scars , amputation , tattoo marks , speech impediments ? No , none . Sign here . Any further details ? She sold her business about eight months ago to Mrs . Esther Redi . What relation are you to the missing person ? Sister . Sign here . Excuse me . I 'm Irving August . Private investigator . I think I can help you . Here 's my card . The name may not mean anything to you but say the word and I 'll have her in 48 hours . Can you ? - Look ,
zone1	and a half miles wide . I ai n't never been off it . I know it like ... Like you know your own back yard . Now you just get me a small retainer , say , 50 bucks and I get your sister . I guarantee it . - I have n't any money right now but I 'll get a job and ... - Lady , this kind of work costs money . I got ta cover all the hospitals , the morgue . That 's the first place you got ta go and it ai n't pleasant , the morgue . You know who I am , August ? - Sure , I do . Then you know if I give you a little advice , it 'll be good advice . Yeah , sure . - That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson . If I were you , I 'd forget it . Okay , Mr . Radeau . It 's forgot . Hey , Danny , get me the file on Jacqueline Gibson , will you ? Whom do you wish to see
zone1	what is it about , Miss Gibson ? - A personal matter . I was given Mr . Ward 's name . - May I ask who gave you his name ? The morgue . Do you feel all right ? I feel like an idiot , fainting in a stranger 's office . We 're not exactly strangers , Mary . Jacqueline spoke about you often . I suppose she told you about me . No . At the morgue , they told me a Mr . Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline . - At the morgue ? No wonder you fainted . I wish you 'd come to me first . - Then you know who Jacqueline is ? But I 'd give a great deal to know . Why ? I love your sister , Mary . I love her very much . It 's easy to understand now , is n't it ? A man would look for her anywhere , Mary . There 's something exciting and unforgettable about Jacqueline . Something you never quite get hold of . Something that keeps a
zone1	I thought I knew her . Today I found out such strange things . Frightening things . I saw a hangman 's noose that Jacqueline had hanging , waiting . Well , at least I can explain that . Your sister had a feeling about life that it was n't worth living unless one could end it . I helped her get that room . - Were n't you afraid ? Afraid she might commit suicide ? People who commit suicide do n't talk about it . No , that room made her happy in some strange way I could n't understand . She lived in a world of her own fancy . She did n't always tell the truth . In fact , I 'm afraid she did n't know what the truth was . It 's difficult to explain to a youngster . - I 'm not a youngster . I can understand . - Color 's returning to your cheeks . You look as if you were coming back to life . Sure you did n't faint because you were hungry ? You know , I did
zone1	6 . Time for dinner . Thank you . It was a lovely dinner . - Good . But I feel guilty . It does n't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone . Look , you ca n't make looking for Jacqueline your life 's work . You 've got to do other things . Live , get some enjoyment out of life . I hope you 'll let me help you . - Thank you . Good night . - Good night , Mary . Miss Gibson , I 've been waiting for you . I want you to know I decided to take your case . Mr . August , I 'm not at all ... - Look , do n't say a word . I 've taken an interest in you and I 'm willing to help you . I think I know where to find your sister . Where ? - Wait a minute . This has a lot of angles . You 've got ta take it easy . Tell me , do you know a Mrs . Redi ? Yes
zone1	's what she told you . I looked it up in the Hall of Records . Your sister deeded her the business as an outright gift . - Why would Mrs . Redi lie to me ? That 's what I tried to find out . I went to the La Sagesse used a phony health inspector 's badge . They let me go through the works . All but one room . That room was locked . I 'd like to see the inside of that room . - You think my sister is there ? Ca n't tell . - Can we go there now ? You ca n't just go breaking into places . They got a night watchman and locks on the door . If she 's in there , it wo n't make any difference about warrants . I want to go there . - I do n't know if if I wan na go with you or not . Which room is it ? It 's the last door at the end of this hall . You scared ? Yes . Let 's get
zone1	on , Mr . August . You could open the door . I 'd stay right here . It 's only a little way , Mr . August . We ca n't stand here all night . You could go and open the door . Mr . August , the night watchman . The night watchman , he 's in the salon . Mr . August , what is it ? What 's the matter ? Mr . August . Do you know where you 're going , lady ? You 've been to the end of the line and back again . I hope you enjoyed the ride . Please . Please . I want your help , please . Those men , do n't let them get out . What 's the matter now ? - One of them has been murdered . What men ? But they were there . Oh , yeah ? Extra ! Murder , read all about it ! Extra ! Murder , read all about it ! Extra ! Murder , read all about it ! Extra ! Murder , read all
zone1	murder . A woman on 52nd Street . But you do believe me . Well , the important thing is the police wo n't believe you . I saw him on the floor . He was cut here . The blood was running out . He was dead , I know it . And then on the subway I saw him . White . With the men holding him up between them . Yes , of course . But the police would say you 'd probably had a bad dream . He was a kind little man in his way . And I made him go down that hall into the darkness . I made him do it . Drink your milk . I do n't like to be ordered to do anything . Oh , I 'm sorry . I did n't intend to treat you like a child . But you have treated me that way . - I wo n't do it again . We 're friends . I promise I 'll never order you about again . However , I wo n't say that I 'll
zone1	take charge right now . I have a job for you . - A job ? Remember you told me you 're good with youngsters ? Well , today I bumped into an old friend of mine , Mrs . Wheeler . She runs a settlement house down in the Village . She 's looking for a kindergarten teacher . - I 'd like that . It 's not much money , but it 'd be enough to live on . You 'd move out of that hotel to a furnished room . Maybe the Romaris would have a room . They seem nice . The people at the restaurant ? - Yes . If you want , I have time to take you to see Mrs . Wheeler right now . Yes , sir . Mr . Ward will see you in just a few minutes . Wo n't you wait , Dr . Judd ? - Thank you . Dr . Judd ? Are you Dr . Louis Judd ? - Yes . I read your book in which you wrote about the cure for drinking . You
zone1	, it 's ... It 's my father . I wanted to talk to you . You wrote about cures . I 'm sorry , I do n't practice anymore . I find it easier to write about mental illness and leave the cure of it to others . Yes , sir . Mr . Ward is free now , doctor . There are other psychiatrists who can help your father . Dipsomania is rather sordid . Thank you . I 've come from Jacqueline . She needs money . I thought you did n't know where she was . I did n't . She came to me a few days ago . To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me . She thought you might lighten that burden . If she wants money from me , she can come to me herself . I 'm afraid she ca n't do that , Ward . It would endanger her . - This is nonsense . Unless I know where Jacqueline is and how she is I 'm not going to give you any money . You
zone1	her life in order to satisfy your own curiosity . It 's not just for myself I 'm asking . Her sister 's here . The kid 's half crazy with anxiety . As a man you distrust me . Perhaps you can believe me as a physician . Well , then I can tell you in addition to other dangers there 's a danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity . I would advise against you seeing her . - But why ? She 's been ill , erratic , but I 've never known of anything like that . You can believe me or not just as you choose . How much does she want ? - She can use a hundred dollars . I 'll give you a check . - She can only use cash . I have n't got that much in cash . - How much have you ? About 45 dollars . For the time being , I imagine that must do . Thank you . Tell me , how is Jacqueline ? - As beautiful as ever . Tell me ... - She
zone1	, see , Miss Gibson helped me . It 's a table . - Beautiful . We show it to Papa tonight . Did Michelle eat her soup today ? - She 's been an angel . Mommy , wait for me . - Angelo , wait . Well , Mary , are n't you the popular one . You 've a visitor again . Mr . Ward ? - No , not this time . It 's a gentleman called Judd . Dr . Judd . Dr . Judd ? - Yes , Miss Gibson . I 've come to take you to your sister . Do n't be so amazed , it 's a very ordinary matter . I 'm Jacqueline 's physician . Mr . Ward told me you were here . Jacqueline sent me to bring you to her . - Then you know where she is ? If I did n't know where she was , could I take you to her ? Get your hat and coat . We have n't much time . It 's amid marble splendors such as these that Jacqueline
zone1	the left , the sinister side . She 's not here . She 's gone . I do n't know why she left . She knows she should n't have . She 's left me to meet them alone . I ca n't . What makes you so nervous , Dr . Judd ? Who are they ? I ca n't stay here . I 'll have to leave you . Jacqueline . Is this her ? No . Where 's Jacqueline Gibson ? - I do n't know . She was just here . Where did she go ? - I tell you , I do n't know . You went out with her and do n't know where she went ? I do n't know . Why do you want Jacqueline ? What right have you to question me ? I have all the right in the world . I 'm Paul Radeau , a private investigator . I 've been hired to find your sister by her husband Gregory Ward . - Husband ? What are you thinking of , Bella ? Can I eat dry ?
zone1	. Look , Mary , just because I kept a secret from you does n't make a monster of me . Please , I ca n't go on explaining things like this to your right ear . Last night in this very restaurant , Mr . Jason Hoag paid a pretty compliment to my right ear . Who the devil is he ? - A poet . He 's sitting right over there . That 's his table , the one at the feet of Dante . Do you remember the first day you came to my office , frightened and broken up ? And I asked you if Jacqueline had ever spoken about me to you ? You said no . Then how could I tell you we were married ? And afterwards ... I did n't tell you afterwards because there were so many things coming up to make me worry . My beautiful one . Why do you bring me wine when you yourself are so intoxicating ? You 're my favorite audience , Bella . Why ca n't everyone be happy like we are ? Laugh
zone1	, so sad because she ca n't find her sister . And that man with her , he does n't make her laugh . Just sits and talks . We are happy , Mrs . Romari , because you have everything and I have nothing to lose . You should make her laugh , Jason . Come , make jokes for her . You could have told me you were Jacqueline 's husband . Things changed , Mary . The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed . I want to find her to settle things . What things ? Why ? Why you two are so sad ? Your food will not digest and your wine will sour . You must laugh to eat well . I 've brought Jason to make you laugh . Mr . Hoag , this is Mr . Ward . Sit down . I 'll get the rest of your dinner . I 'm under orders to make you laugh . In Mrs . Romari 's mind , poetry and humor have some strange affinity which they do n't have in fact . She wants me
zone1	Gibson , I feel as sad as you do . Well , then I 've spoiled your dinner . Your food wo n't digest and your wine will sour . You will have to make all the jokes , because I 'm going to be serious . I 'm going to find your sister . Shuffle the cards well , Natalie . This is a trick of telepathy , not card manipulation . Now pass the cards to me . Gladys , will you hand the cards to Louis while I answer the door ? Jason . How nice to see you . - I have brought some friends , Natalie . May we come to your party ? - Oh , of course , come in . Now , all of you must remember the cards that you 've selected . Mrs . Cortez , Mary Gibson and Mr . Ward . - So nice to meet you . The cards ca n't speak for themselves . It 's purely a matter of the mind . - You 'll have to excuse me . Mrs . Freeman , yours
zone1	diamonds . Yours , Mrs . Gosden , the queen of hearts . - How do you ever do it , Louis ? Hello , Jason . Where is Jacqueline Gibson ? What a peculiar question . - I saw you with her last week . I knew you 'd be here tonight . Where is she ? It 's neither your business to ask nor mine to tell . Wait . Look over there . Do you see that girl ? That 's Jacqueline 's sister . It 's because of her that I ask . Why come to me ? Because there was another girl years ago . A nice girl . She lived in Barrow Street . I saw her with you once . I saw her with you twice . Then I never saw her again . - She was my patient . What was she to you ? I do n't think you 'd understand if I told you . I think I understand without your telling me . I know something of your history , Jason . I know you have n't written for
zone1	that wonderful first book ? After all the adulation and good reviews ? I 'd have given anything to have written that book . You had all my admiration and respect once . There you are . Do you know any more card tricks ? Hello , Ward . My dear Miss Gibson . Gibson ? Are you Jacqueline 's sister ? Yes , do you .. ? - Know her ? My dear , we were intimate . The times we used to have together . I bet she never told you about that . You 're too young . I 'm afraid you do n't understand . Miss Gibson 's sister is missing . Missing ? Well , no wonder . When she took up with Louis Judd , she went out of circulation just like that . My dear , have I said something ? Too many people here . Perhaps Jacqueline is lonely for me . You see , Mary , I 'm not quite a fool . At least you knew about Dr . Judd . Yes . - And you knew he 'd be
zone1	you that I know that much , and can guess more will you trust me to look for Jacqueline ? I want you to look for Jacqueline . I 'm a terrible failure , Mary . A book clerk by day and a poet by night . Not a very good one . But if you 'll trust me , at this one thing I wo n't fail . I 'll find your sister . You have such lovely hands , Miss Gottschalk . So slim and capable . Mr . Hoag , I really should n't be doing this . It 's against the rules . Why did you say you wanted them ? I 'd like to see what books my friends read so I 'll know what to buy them . Nothing nicer than a book for a gift . Who was the first one ? Mrs . Redi ? P , Q , R ... Yes , here it is . And the other was Judd ? - Yes , Dr . Louis Judd . He 's here too . Would it be asking too much
zone1	not at all , Mr . Hoag . Why , Mr . Hoag , most of these books are on the closed shelf . You 'll have to get permission . I would n't want to take them out . I 'd like to look at them . Well , since you 're over 21 . Mimi . Come in . Well , what is it ? A parallelogram with a split triangle in its very center . I found out that Mrs . Redi reads the same books as Dr . Judd . I do n't think that 's so revealing . - But who is Judd ? A psychiatrist . It 's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies . But why should Mrs . Redi , a woman with a beauty parlor ? I do n't know . - That 's just it . And this figure , she traced it . The book I saw at the library had been marked " perfect " by the library inspector in March . Mrs . Redi had it out in April
zone1	This figure is the symbol of the Palladists . It 's all clear to me now . So clear . I thought so , but just to be sure I 'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of devil worshippers . - Devil worshippers ? But , look , I 'm serious . It 's a very real and earnest society . A dangerous society . I can imagine . Sometime before those nice white gloves are dry you 're going to go and find out a few things about this Mrs . Redi . Is Mrs . Redi nice to work for ? Oh , Redi 's all right . But there 's only one Miss Jacqueline . Mrs . Redi seems rather an odd woman to me . She 's really a pretty good sort . What does she do with herself after business hours ? It 's always seemed to me that she was sort of lonely and unhappy . Well , Mary , I guess most people are . There , that 's it . In the old days , this would 've been
zone1	, I like to do your hair . Thank you . Do you know what this is , Frances ? Why , I ought to . Mrs . Redi 's new trademark . Of course , I should 've known . This figure 's been puzzling me . Hello , Mary . It 's nice to see you . No news of Jacqueline ? - I 'm afraid not . Well , that 's too bad . What did she want ? Nothing . I just did her hair . What were you talking about ? Nothing . Nothing ? Why , that 's absurd . I heard you laughing and talking . She was asking questions . Oh , well , she was asking about you . Whether it was nice to work for you or not . And that was all ? Well , she asked about the trademark . What did she want to know ? - She showed me a drawing . Oh , you fool . Why , that symbol is us . Us . She was asking about us . Mary ? - Yes
zone1	, I 'll be out in a minute . That wo n't be necessary . I have n't much to say . If I were you , Mary , I 'd go back to school . I 'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline . I ca n't give up looking for her , Mrs . Redi . No matter what you 're hinting at . I have no intention whatsoever of hinting . Your sister , Mary , is a murderess . She killed Irving August . Stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding . I do n't believe you . I had to help get rid of the body . You saw it on the subway . And I warn you , Mary , go back . You do n't know what you 're doing or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister . You go back to school . I 'm sorry to be late , Natalie . We have n't begun tea yet . Hello , Frances . - Hello , Mrs . Redi .
zone1	Wo n't you pour ? I 'm sorry , I 'm nervous . This is very trying for me . - I know . You introduced Jacqueline to us . But how could you tell ? - I should 've known . She had no sincerity , no real belief . Miss Rowan , do you take cream ? Please , Natalie , would you mind pouring ? You should n't be nervous . There 's nothing personal or vengeful in what we are about to do . We have only to make a decision . But it can be such a horrible decision because we 're all pledged to nonviolence . Now , this ... - Our founder must have known when he wrote these seemingly contradictory rules . The rule of nonviolence and the law that whoever betrays us must die . He must have known . - But I do n't understand it . Some of us , Frances , must believe without understanding . Yes , I suppose so . I went back through the history last night . I read about Johann Rozenquartz . I
zone1	it fully , Mrs . Redi . " We will avoid violence . For once undertaken , violence can become its own master and lead to either good or evil . " - But he also wrote ... I can quote that too . " Those who go out into the marketplaces and speak of us and give knowledge of our being and our deeds whomsoever doeth this shall die . " I 'm puzzled . Since our order was founded six betrayals have been listed . And six deaths as punishment . And now there 's Jacqueline . - Oh , but ... But you ca n't do anything to her . You must n't hurt her . But she betrayed us , Frances . - She did n't betray us . She was only going to a doctor . A psychiatrist . She told him , Frances . She told him about us . I know this is difficult for you . I know that you love her . - But she did n't betray us . Even if I believed that , I would still consider her
zone1	Irving August 's death . Without consulting me , Mrs . Redi was ill-advised enough to have the body removed by Leo and Durk . This makes us all a party to the crime . What if there 's a trial ? What if Jacqueline is asked about the removal of the body ? Do you think , Frances , that she will keep silent ? It is a real danger and one which forces our decision . And Jacqueline 's sister ? - I 've taken care of Mary . I 've spoken to her , and she 's going back to school . Good . Then it is decided . Leo and Durk and I will complete our plans . Mary . This is wonderful , your coming here so unexpectedly . It 's almost like a wish come true . I want to show you my room . I want you to see all of it . But it 's a small room , Jason . It 's grown big with the years . And my window , through which I see the world . It 's
zone1	that 's not a searchlight . It 's a sword blade , cutting the blue cloak of a prince . Not stars ... - Jason . I 'm going back to Highcliffe . I 've come to say goodbye . But I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me ... Well , that it was your advent into my world . It turns out to be goodbye . Why ? Please do n't make me tell you , Jason . I thought I was your friend , Mary . Just goodbye is n't enough for a friend . I had begun to write again . That 's what I was doing when you came in . It 's because of Jacqueline . I ca n't go on looking for her . You went to see Mrs . Redi . She told you something . What was it ? Jacqueline 's a murderess . She killed a man . You believe that ? - I have to . It was Irving August . Everything Mrs . Redi said , it fits in with what I saw
zone1	on the subway . But if it 's true , then there 's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline . And Gregory , he loves her . He loves you , Mary . You 'll have to tell him . He 's Jacqueline 's husband . I ca n't . But you 've got to tell him , Mary . Even if only for the practical reason that he 's a lawyer and will know what to do . I 'm going to phone him . Well , she 's got to be found . That 's the first step . She 's got to be found so she can give herself up to the police . But we 've tried so long to find her . Judd could tell us , if he would . Do you think he knows about this ? - I do n't know . Well , he 's clever , and he 's cautious in his way . I think if he knew he 'd advise her to do what I want . Surrender herself to the police and stand trial
zone1	tell him . Could you find him ? - I suppose so . I guess I could pick him up somewhere . Jason I sometimes wonder . You 're so sweet to me . So kind and sympathetic . I do n't know how I can ever thank you . Thank me ? You do n't have to thank me . What 's that ? - Verse . Verse I wrote . Do n't bother going up . I can do this all night , Jason . Watch . Following me to find Jacqueline ? Well , it wo n't work . Love and understanding wo n't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet . Actually , there are two favors I want to ask . One as a poet , one as a detective . Sounds strange . I 'm going to be very wary . Some time ago , you spoke about my writing again . I want your help . I 'd like you to bring this to your publisher . This is curious , Jason . Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare
zone1	sudden humility . I should like people to read what I have written . I hope it 'll find as much favor as your other book . But somehow I doubt it . The time is out of tune . Why not let your publisher judge that ? Wait . There 's that other favor . I 'd forgotten . - Tell me where Jacqueline is . We 've got to find her . - You do n't expect me to do that , do you ? Yes , when I tell you . - Tell me what ? You 'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is when I tell you she 's a murderess . She killed a man . Tell me , why this sudden desire to publish ? To awaken like Byron and find yourself famous ? I think it 's time . - No other reason ? No woman ? Not the little Miss Gibson ? Perhaps . Wait a minute . I 'll call her . Jacqueline , this is Judd . Jacqueline . Who is it ? - Judd .
zone1	. Oh , Mary . Jacqueline . It 's all right . You 're safe . Nothing 's going to hurt you . Your husband seems very certain of that . - Yes . I 'm very certain there 's only one way to help you , Jacqueline to protect you . You 've got to come with us . Let me do all I can as a lawyer to straighten out Irving August 's death . You must come with us , darling . Let us help you . For me , this seems to be the end of a delightful relationship . Here . This will put some life into you . It 's like coming back to life . It would be much easier , Jacqueline , if you told me exactly what happened . I 'd know what to do for you . Please , Jacqueline . You know about the Palladists . You know who they are what they are . I was one of them . Jacqueline was always a sensationalist trying to seize onto something . Anything to bring her happiness . Through
zone1	. It appealed to her . I was n't happy with them . I wanted to break away . I was miserable . I went to Louis for help . They felt that I 'd betrayed them . They wanted me to die . Kill myself . They kept me locked up at La Sagesse . I was there such a long time . Imagine the effect of such imprisonment on Jacqueline . I was terrified . The darkness in the corners of the room all the little noises . Then one night the door opened . A man came in . Tiptoeing in . I had a scissors in my hand . I struck at him . Do n't . We know what happened . Do n't go on . Any court in the land would understand . We 'll wait a few days , let you rest , then we 'll go to the police . Why ca n't Jacqueline stay here with me for a few days ? You 'd like that , would n't you ? There 's my old friend . The searchlight ? Cyrano
zone1	call it . I like it . I 've always loved the story . A man knowing he could n't have the woman he loved and wooing her for his friend . We 're friends , are n't we , Gregory ? It 's been a hard evening for both of you . Perhaps you ought to take Jacqueline to your room , Mary . Good night , Jacqueline . Good night , Mary . - Good night . This is no time to play Cyrano . What was in your mind ? I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline . To let her know . - To let her know what ? That you love Mary . She 'll have to know sometime . Not from me . Not from Mary . Goodbye , darling . I 'll only be gone until 3 . Bye . - lf you get lonely go down and see Mrs . Romari . I told her you were staying with me . I wo n't be lonely . Yes , this is Mary . But she could n't have gone out .
zone1	went with , or Mr . Ward ? Two men ? No . I 'll get home as soon as I can , Mr . Romari . The acceptance of a secret is an obligation . In this case , the obligation carried the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret . You understand that , do n't you ? Yes . I understand it . Then you also understand that you must die . No . You 've spoken so often of ending it all . I ca n't understand why this should be so difficult for you . You have only to drink a little . - Yes , Jacqueline . You were always talking suicide , of ending your life when you wanted to . Yes . When I wanted to . - It does n't matter . You want to now . You should want to . It is your obligation , your duty . You have only to stretch out your hand , take up the glass and drink a little . It wo n't hurt . No , no , no . You
zone1	you have enough courage to hear what I 've kept from you all these years . That girl you loved that other patient of mine ... She did n't disappear . She 's in an asylum . A horrible , raving thing . I never wanted you to know . And all the while you 've been my friend . Please may I have a drink of water ? I 'm very thirsty . Drink . No . There will be no water , and there 'll be no rest . You may as well drink . No , no ! If you like , I 'll go with you to dinner . I 'd like that . - Jason . I ca n't find Gregory . I 've been trying to find him . What 's wrong , Mary ? Jacqueline . Mr . Romari phoned me . She went out this afternoon with two men he 'd never seen before . They may have been friends of hers . - No . She would n't go with anyone unless compelled . These months of hiding have made her
zone1	- What ? They may have found her . Would they hurt her ? I do n't know . You 'd better go up to your room and wait for us , Mary . Go ahead , Jacqueline . Go ahead . It is late . Drink it , Jacqueline . There 's nothing else for you to do . They say you 've got to die . Drink it , Jacqueline ! You 've got to ! I ca n't stand this ! No . No , I ca n't let you die ! The only time I was ever happy was when I was working with you . You were always so good to me . You may go now , Jacqueline . The decision was against violence , but there 'll be another decision . Today , tomorrow we 'll find you , but now you may go . I told you you could go . Please help me . There 's a man following me . I should n't wonder , babe . - I 'm serious . Help me . I 'll help you to
zone1	. Come along . Who are you ? I 'm Mimi . I 'm dying . - No . Yes . I 've been quiet . Oh , ever so quiet . I hardly move . And yet it keeps coming all the time , closer and closer . And I rest and I rest and still I 'm dying . And you do n't wan na die ? I 've always wanted to die . Always . - I 'm afraid . And I 'm tired of being afraid . Of waiting . Why wait ? - I 'm not going to wait . I 'm going out , and I 'm going to laugh and dance and do all the things I used to do . - And then ? I do n't know . You will die . Now that you 've hounded and worried her you do n't even know where she is . At least tell me , has she been here ? Yes . She left here an hour ago . She may even be home by now . Why do n't you try
zone1	. The lovers of evil . It 's a joke . Pathetic little joke . We have n't asked your opinion . I propose to give it to you anyway . You 're a poor , wretched group of people who have taken the wrong turning . Wrong ? Who knows what is wrong or right ? If I prefer to believe in satanic majesty and power , who can deny me ? What proof could you bring that good is superior to evil ? It 's hard to put into words , but you 're wrong . One proof . I 'll prove you wrong . This afternoon Jason and I were talking together and I remembered certain phrases from childhood . Simple half-forgotten words . It was the Lord 's Prayer . I 'm a physician yet not I nor any of my colleagues , no matter how learned have ever found a substitute for those words as a rule for human relationship . You might remember them . Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us . There 's a sentence for you

zone1	5243442 Mr . Grandison 's residence . Oh , hello there . Is my wandering husband home , by any chance ? No . I have n't seen Oliver since lunch . I 'm all alone here- Thursday , you know . Who ? No ... Oh , no ... No . Please ! Aaah ! Hello , Roslyn ? Hello , Roslyn ! Hello ? This is the operator . Your party 's hung up . Shall I try them again ? Did you get the house ? What ? Oh . Oh , no . No , there was n't any answer . Let 's get out of here . All right . Waiter ? What time is it ? About 9:30 . I mean , exactly . Exactly 9:37 . Waiter , if my husband does come , Tell him we 've gone on to the Pelican Club . Yes , ma'am . Come along , lover . " Tragedy strikes again . " What ? " Last week , Victor Grandison 's " attractive young secretary , Roslyn Wright , committed suicide at the Grandison Estate in Croton , New York . " The genial commentator
zone1	confesses that the tragedy has him completely baffled . " Mr . Grandison was doing his weekly mystery broadcast in the New York studio at the time of her death . " Was our show that bad ? Poor Roslyn . I liked her . I wonder why she did it . You 'd better watch your step . Oh , do n't worry about me . I shall die at The ripe old age of 90 . With my grandchildren at my bedside ... If I can find a grandfather for them . Stand by . On the nose . This is the United Motor Company ... Starring your genial host , The renowned writer , art collector , and teller of strange tales ... Victor Grandison . Good evening , ladies and gentlemen . Grandison speaking . Tonight , I bring you from the files . Of the nation 's unsolved crimes the story of one of the most brutal and yet the most cunningly conceived murders ever committed , a murder of rare delicacy and wondrous ease that was called ... suicide . Yes , suicide ,
zone1	us ... free . But is he really free ? Can he escape from the evil that he has done ? No . By day , it follows him like his shadow . At night , the cold hands of death awaken him from a thousand nightmares . And so , day and night , he is driven on , with the dead forever haunting him , pursuing him . Or perhaps he is n't running away , but is in hiding in some dark hole , listening with terror to the voice of his own conscience- a voice that tells him over and over that the hunter has become the hunted , that there 's no escape for one who has committed ... murder . They say that drowning men relive their lives in seconds . The guilty , too , relive their crimes a thousand times a day ... At every unexpected sound , at every glance that turns their way , and at a thousand fears that have no form . The guilty must go on and on , Hiding his evil behind a mask-The calm and
zone1	unsuspected is anywhere , everywhere ... So be on your guard . He might be the man who calls you " Friend , " who visits frequently at your home . He might even be someone who comes often to my own home . And while I pride myself on being an amateur detective , Even I might easily be fooled . And yet , his day of reckoning must come . He is tormented by fear ... That someday he will make one false move , one slip , That will betray him . And when he does , the lightning Of justice will strike ... the unsuspected . Victor 's the only man I know . That can turn my blood to ice water . Let 's have another drink . We could all be Murderers ! Check the glasses , Kent , and open up some more wine . Some more wine . Hello , Mary . Oh , professor ! Dr . Edelman , I 'm so glad you could come . It 's thrilling having a psychiatrist here . It 's very difficult to think
zone1	n't open up all our secret doors . What 's hidden behind yours , Althea ? Ghosts ? No , Mr . Donovan . There 's nothing a ghost could do for me . Let me know when Mr . Grandison gets here , will you , please ? Yes , miss . Uh , do n't drink too much . Oh , excuse me . Louder and gayer , Lover ! * I like your style * * Say , I think it 's marvelous * Good evening , sir . Good evening . Excuse me , madam . There 's a gentleman ... Oh , thank you . Pardon me , lover . It 's the most thrilling party ! Having fun ? Oh , yes ! Good evening . I'm-Yes , I know . You 're Victor Grandison 's niece , Mrs . Oliver Keane . Althea . My name is Howard- Steven Howard . I have some bags in the cab . Bags , sir ? But , uh - yes , sir . You brought luggage ? Do you plan to stay ? Obviously .
zone1	do you want to see Mr . Grandison about ? Quite a large party , is n't it ? Would you care to meet anyone ? No . Not very appetizing . It 's Victor 's birthday . Once a year , his friends crawl out of the woodwork . This year , it 's a surprise party . Will he be surprised to see you ? I like matches . You never have to refill them . And when you 're through with them , you simply throw them away ... Like people . Why has n't Victor asked you here before ? Probably because we 've never met . He 's not expecting you ? You 're a very curious woman , are n't you , Mrs . Keane ? You are going to tell me . Maybe . What will you trade ? A drink ? Brandy . Thank you . You glued to this spot ? Home is where the heart is . Very amusing . You 're drinking too much , as usual . How much , my love , is too much ? Regard
zone1	mind lose its razor edge ? Do I slur my words ? Do I forget anything ? Not a single , solitary thing of all the things I 'd give so much to forget . No , I 'm still conscious . Therefore , my sweet , far from having had too much , I 've not had enough yet . The least you could do is stay sober . While we have guests in the house . I 'd then be free to dwell on our sacred marriage vows , Which you , my love , hold in such light esteem . Oliver , you talk too much . I 'll be quiet . I 'll just sit and bask in cowardly splendor . " Thus , conscience doth make cowards of us all . " Here . Thank you . You seem interested . Fascinated . You know , it 's very much like Mateo in his middle period . Who painted it ? My husband , in his sober period ... Before he married me . It 's lovely . It 's so alive . She 's
zone1	was on the freighter that was burned at sea last month . And Victor 's secretary committed suicide last week . There 's no connection . I did n't say there was . She was beautiful . She drank too much milk and her seams were always straight . You did n't like her . Frankly , she bored me . She was sweet , shy , unforgettable . I can understand why you did n't like her . You knew Matilda ? I was married to her . Do n't drop that . Now you know what I 'm doing here ... And I 've earned this . Oh ... That 's impossible . Is it ? She was in love with-With your husband Oliver . She told me-that and other things ... That you married him just a few days before she was supposed to . I know quite a lot about you , Althea ... Quite a lot . Man : Quiet , everybody . Here he comes now . Surprise ! Who thought up this torture ? Oh , Victor , dear , you are surprised
zone1	we did remember your birthday . My dear , I 've been trying to Forget it for the last 20 years . Happy returns ! Oh , Victor ! Happy birthday , Victor . There 's the lord of the manor now . This will be quite A surprise party for Victor when he discovers you and Matilda were married . I 'll tell him myself ... Later . And deny me that pleasure ? I doubt if you deny Yourself many things . I generally get what I want . Good evening , miss Moynihan . Good evening . Oh , look at them . A cork pops for free , and they all swarm like locusts . We thought you were n't coming , Jane . Oh , I generally get places ... After driving Victor there and parking his car , and-Well , you see , I 'm all things to victor ... Except a woman . Why , Donovan , I 'm delighted to see you , and surprised . You look like a fish out of water . You were the bait . Yes .
zone1	Happy birthday , my darling ! My dear , this is all very lovely , But why a party at a time like this ? This is like dancing on their graves . Oh , I 'm sorry , Victor . I thought it might help you forget . Well , will you do something for me ? Take that pianist out and have him shot . All right . Happy birthday ! Now , what 's this ? Sweets , to coin a phrase , for the sweet . My dear , it 's a monstrosity . Why , it 's just a plain birthday cake-Not even a hidden sword . Come on , Make a wish . Yeah , Make a wish ! Thinking of stealing it ? Why not something more practical ? I , uh , I was curious about the chandelier . You 're not the first to be curious about that chandelier . It was Mr . Grandison 's secretary who was found hanging from it . And then the police evinced great interest when they cut her down . I read the papers
zone1	Grandison . More , I imagine , to the young woman . But then , of course , no smart girl would be found . Hanging around a Bachelor 's private study . I can get along without any humorous remarks . Will you please get out ? I beg your pardon ? I said , please get out . Surely . Hope to see you before your next birthday . No more birthdays . Grand party , Victor . Had a wonderful time . I had a good time myself , thank you . Oh , Jane , wo n't you stay the night ? I want to begin work early in the morning . Good night , Victor . Sleep in the country with the frogs chirping or whatever they do ? No , thanks , darling . I 'm going back to civilization . Goodbye . Good luck . Good night . Give my love to that small daughter of yours . Ok . Thank you . The nicest thing about guests is their departure . Arrivederci ! Oh , listen , you 're not going .
zone1	have it here , but are n't you tired ? Tired ? After a social evening , Nothing cheers me up as much as a nice , gory murder . Come on , let 's see what you got . Right in there . I 'm perfectly all right . Perfectly All right . Yes , sir . Put him to bed . To bed . Yes , madam . Be gentle with me , Kent . When I 'm in this condition , I tip over very easily . Very easily . Yes , sir . Hmm . Let 's go inside . Coming . Let me see ... This was a hatchet murder , was n't it ? That 's right . Tiny little thing , Is n't she ? Well , there 's only half of her there . Yeah . Who 's this ? That 's the murderer . This good-looking young boy ? Criminals do n't run true to type , Victor . You know that . The most dangerous of all is some charming young killer . That no one will ever suspect- "
zone1	Victor . Victor , there 's something I think you ought to know . Oh , I know . I saw Oliver . I can only suggest that you keep him away from any open flame . It is n't Oliver . Have you noticed a young man around here with very bad manners ? I think you 'll find him in your study . In my study ? Good evening , Mr . Grandison . Were you looking for me ? Hello , sir . Are you a late guest for the party . Or an early arrival for breakfast ? Neither . This is Mr . Howard , Victor . I 'm delighted to meet you , Mr . Howard . Now , if you do n't mind , Mr . Donovan and I have things to talk about . Victor , I think you ought to talk to Mr . Howard . He and Matilda were married . Married ? You and Matilda were married ? To each other . Really ? When ? 3 days before the accident . I see . Oh , please sit
zone1	, no , do n't go . I 'd rather you stayed . This is Mr . Donovan . We 've met . Casually . Do sit down . You have proof Of what you say ? Of course . You sound suspicious . Merely concerned . Matilda was very dear to us . And to me , too , but I hardly expected this kind of welcome . Well , I ... We ca n't help being curious . At this sudden appearance ... Just as Matilda 's estate is to be legally settled . So you think I want Matilda 's money . It 's a rather large sum-Runs into millions , as you undoubtedly know . That 's the one thing I did n't know . We met , and a few days later , we were married . I had to leave for Lisbon . Matilda was to follow by boat . When I learned the boat had gone down , I came back . You see , I thought I could find something here . That would make not having her ... A little more
zone1	It 's all I want . I 'm not interested in the money . I happen to have money of my own . Quite a bit of money . How lovely . I 'm afraid I 've been in error , sir . You shall have the picture ... And with it , our most heartfelt welcome . I loved Matilda , and anyone she loves would necessarily be very close to me . So you will stay with us tonight ? If I may . Of course you may . We 'll talk some more tomorrow . Will you make him comfortable , my dear ? Yes , I will . I 'll take him to the guesthouse . Fine . Good night . Good night . Good night , sir . I hope you like it . It 's decorated in Early American . Do you like Early American ? Extraordinary , most extraordinary ... But do you know I do n't believe a word he said ? Sounded too much like the truth to be true . Might be interesting to know a good deal more about
zone1	money . I 've discovered that everything worthwhile costs a little money . Good night , Victor . Good night . It 's been a very interesting evening . Mm-hmm . Yes , well ... Victor : " It is difficult now " to pierce the mists of time that obscure what Charles Woodward was thinking when he struck his light of love that fateful blow , but if we may conjecture , it is not too much to assume that his thoughts may have turned back to that lovely Spring day when first they met , " and their adolescent passion flared into its brief breing . " Being , being , being ! Silly word . Silly script . Turn it off , Jane . Want to hear it played back ? No , thank you . I 'll listen to it later . It 's much too nice a day for murder . What 's wrong , Victor ? You 've lost all your zip . You 're as limp as an old girdle . I do n't know what 's the matter with me . The
zone1	. As though something were going to happen-Something unpleasant . I had that feeling once , but I married him anyway . Here , run your pretty blue eyes over next week 's material . You know , it 's a sort of throbbing in the air ... A feeling of inevitability , like ... Like , uh ... Falling in love-a vibration . You probably would n't remember . I 'll have you know I 've vibrated in my time . Once , In Kansas City , I-Oh , well , no use living in the past ... But for 6 months , I vibrated like a musical saw . I beg your pardon , sir . Mr . Donovan , sir ... Huh ? He 's in the library , sir . Oh , good . That 'll be all , Jane . Hi , Donovan . I 'm delighted to see you . I 've been waiting impatiently for you . Will you sit down ? Of course . Jane ... I 'll go quietly , only this shoe is choking me . Well , what did
zone1	go on except his name . Steven Francis Howard . Born April 12 , 1913 . His father was Francis J . Howard . Does that suggest anything to you ? Oil . Yes , quite a lot of oil . Mr . Howard is well-equipped . With pin money , just as he said . 31/2 years in the army- He 's a captain-Wounded twice , discharged early in May at fort Dixon . Went straight to New York , where he stayed at the Sherry Central . Same time Matilda was there . A week later , he went to Lisbon . His story checks all along the line , Victor . Cablegram . I 'll take it . It 's for Mr . Grandison . I 'm Mr . Grandison . You want me to check on anything else , let me know . Thank you very much , and goodbye . Goodbye , Victor . I 'm sorry . I love it . Mercury on a bicycle just brought this . Oh . Hmm . " Are n't you going to open It ? " said
zone1	to-Oh , yeah . Yeah , I was thinking of something else . Uh ... Do you , uh , happen to know where Mr . Howard is ? No , but Althea usually keeps in touch with him , And the last I saw of her , she was headed to the guesthouse ... Vibrating . Does it always take you so long to make a move ? I like to be perfectly sure of what I 'm doing . Were you sure when you married Matilda ? I was . She was n't . Oh . How interesting . How long were you married ? I do n't suppose you could call it a marriage . There was a wedding ceremony . I had to leave the same day . That 's why you think you love her-You have n't been disillusioned . Speaking from experience ? You 've met Oliver . I beg your pardon . I hope I 'm not disturbing you . Oh , no , Victor . We 've been looking everyplace for you . Really ? You 've been playing chess , too
zone1	Steven 's an expert . Mm-hmm . Interesting situation . I 'm afraid you 're going to lose , my dear . We 'll see . Have a drink . No , thanks . I came down here because I have what I think will be very good news for you . You mean , no discrepancies . In your check-up on my story ? No discrepancies ... But you did n't finish your story . There 's an end to it ... Or , rather , a second beginning . What do you mean ? She 's alive . Who ? Matilda . I do n't believe it ! Alive and well and on her way home . I suppose she sent this to me . Because she did n't know where to reach you . Seems that our sorrow was a little premature . " Leaving Rio today . Arrive ... Tomorrow . " She arrives tomorrow . That 's right . We 'll all go down to meet her , banners flying , with a large , noisy band . That wo n't be necessary . I
zone1	That 's a familiar cue-Enter Matilda , exit Althea . I 'll buy that drink now , if you do n't mind . Help yourself . It is n't every day a man 's wife comes back from the grave . No . I believe you 're in considerable trouble . Check and mate In 3 . Good luck . Man , over loudspeaker : Flight number 7 from Rio De Janeiro . Landing at gate 3 . Man : Hey , what 's she doing taking a trip at a time like this , anyway ? Second man : What else would she do with all of her dough ? Well , she could give it to me . No sign of Grandison yet . You 'd think he 'd be here to cash in on that publicity . Let 's go ! There she is . Get a good shot of her , Joe . Do n't crowd her . How about a story , miss Frazier ? Do n't spare the details , miss Frazier . Give us the whole story . Was it a terrible experience
zone1	Must have been very exciting . What happened ? How does it feel to be dead ? Wo n't you please-Were you afraid when the ship caught fire ? We understand you were picked up by a fish trawler . Is that right ? Yes . It took us 3 weeks to get to brazil . Why did n't you send word you were still alive ? The boat that rescued us had no radio . Break it up . Ca n't you see ... Wait a minute ! We 've got a story here ! How about your plans for the future ? Victor let me come to meet you . When can we get a complete statement ? We 'll give you a statement later . Let 's get out of here . Feeling better ? Yes , thank you . But after all that 's happened , I ca n't understand why Grandy was n't there . He 's all right , is n't he ? He 's fine . He wanted to meet you , But he thought it would only complicate the publicity . You
zone1	and phone him later . Oh , good . You have n't changed . You 're as beautiful as ever . Well , that 's very kind of you . You know , I 'm afraid I did n't get your name . I 'm terribly sorry . I probably should have remembered , but I-Matilda , what is this ? You know who I am . I 've never seen you before in my life . Croton operator ? 48305 , please . A vermouth cassis for the lady . How do you know that ? That 's right , is n't it ? Brandy for me . Yes , sir , brandy . Hello ? Mr . Grandison , please . Is that Roslyn ? No , it 's Jane Moynihan . Hello , sir . This is Steve Howard . Yes , she 's here with me . Oh , Grandy , darling ! Of course I 'm well . I am happy . I 'm so anxious to see you . Tell Steven to bring you home . Mm-hmm . We 'll warm up a fatted
zone1	. There you are , sir . You 're pretty sold On Victor , are n't you ? He 's the kindest , most unselfish man I 've ever known . Yes , I know . I like him , too . I like him even more for what he means to you . Course , I ca n't say the same thing about Althea or Oliver , Although I think he regrets the way he treated you . I did n't know anyone knew about that . Why should n't I ? You know , it must 've been pretty horrible for you-The trouble with Oliver , the bitterness , the wedding , and after that , a shipwreck . I can understand why you 're so confused . About what ? In the car . Do n't you remember ? You told me you 'd never seen me before . I do n't anything hurt quite as much . I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to hurt you . Please forgive me . You handed me quite a scare . I realize we did n't see
zone1	it meant so little to you that you 'd completely forgotten me . Just your name . Is something wrong ? Yes . Something 's very definitely wrong . If you do n't remember my name . Howard . Steven Howard . Does n't that mean anything to you ? Afraid not . We must have met somewhere . You would n't be so sure . But I do n't quite remember . You do n't remember me At all ? I 'm sorry . All those weeks In brazil . Before you let anyone know you were alive ... Why ? What happened to you ? Why should you think something happened to me ? You were ill , were n't you ? Very ill . Well , yes . I was suffering from exposure and shock , if-Only that , or was there something more ? You had a nervous breakdown , did n't you ? Did n't you ? Yes . That explains it- amnesia and shock . I should have known when you told me about Oliver . I did n't tell you about Oliver .
zone1	this very table . This is where we met , Matilda . You 've forgotten . Why should I forget when there 's nothing to remember ? No ? Not even our marriage ? Marriage ? ! You 're my wife , Matilda . Well , that 's impossible . You 're Mrs . Steven Howard . Here 's our wedding certificate . It 's a forgery , and you 're lying . Why should I ? You know that better than I do . Perhaps because my father left me a fortune . So did mine . Shall we compare checkbooks ? No , it had nothing to do With your money . I married you Because I loved you . I know I was very ill , but They said it was hysteria . I remember everything that happened . The shipwreck , Oliver ... If I married you , why should I forget that and nothing else ? Probably because you wanted to . You were n't in love with me . I knew that when we were married . But I only-It is n't important .
zone1	n't marry you ! Waiter ... Yes , sir ? Thank you , sir . Did n't you like your Cassie , Mrs . Howard ? You bribed him to say that ! Well , there 's no use going on with this . If you do n't remember , or wo n't , that 's all there is to it . I 'll take you home , and that 's the last you 'll see of me . I do n't suppose you remember this , either . Should I ? We were on our way to be married . We took the next turnoff . Take it now . I 'd like to meet the man you say married us . How do you do ? Could you tell me If-My dear ! We read in the paper that you were safe . How very kind and thoughtful of you to come here , Mrs . Howard . But , you see , I 'm not Mrs . Howard . My wife would like to see Judge Maynard , if she may . Of course . Come right
zone1	judge is performing . A wedding service in the study , but of course you remember . You 've seen me before ? I never forget a bride , No matter how many I 've seen . Just a moment . I 'll tell the judge you 're here . But it 's a mistake ! It must be ! Well , we were married . There 's no mistake about that . But I 'm afraid I rushed you into it , and I should n't have . But I do n't understand ! Why ca n't I remember ? Oh , my ! Well , goodbye ! Thank you so much . Goodbye ! My dear , I 'm so happy you 're safe . But you could n't possibly know who-My wife 's been under a great strain , judge . She does n't remember . There seems to be some doubt in her mind . Whether our marriage was The right thing or not . I see . If there 's anything I can do ... Perhaps there is , sir . In a few days
zone1	get an annulment If you want to . Judge Maynard will help . Of course . I 'll do anything I can . You 're very kind . I 'm very grateful to you for being so patient with me . It 's all right , Matilda . I 'll take you home . Goodbye . You got to stop it , Mr . Grandison . I ca n't take any more ! I would n't entertain any awkward ideas about hastening my departure from the scheme of things if I were you , press . You got to leave me alone ! Will you please stop trying to convince yourself that you have enough courage to murder me ? And give me that ridiculous weapon . Give it to me , I say , before I lose my temper ... A thing I detest . I ca n't sleep , I ca n't eat . Not since that broadcast ... When you called me " The unsuspected . " How do you think I felt ? Well , if I were in your shoes , I should feel extremely
zone1	, I want you to hear something . Come along with me . For many years now , I 've been recording my programs . Before broadcasting them-Just for practice purposes-So that my listeners would have the benefit . Of every full , rich tone . Now , occasionally , this device has other uses , one of which I now commend to your attention . Press , on recording : I swear , Mr . Grandison , I did n't mean to kill her . I was only threatening her when she screamed . Victor , on recording : But you were overzealous , press . Why did n't you tell the police ? Press , on recording : I did n't dare . Victor , on recording : Why are you confessing to me ? Press , on recording : Because I ... Where did you Get that ? I made it ... On the occasion of your first visit . The microphone was hidden as you told me your story , So it turned out to be one of my best programs ... For which I 'm
zone1	so impetuous . Now , you do n't really imagine that I 'd be foolish enough to let you destroy the only copy , do you ? There are others . And if anything ever happens to me , the police will be listening to one of them . Why do n't you leave me alone ? I intend to . I work for my material . I have to call on many different kinds of people at many different times . What is it you want from me ? Nothing , actually . My interest in you is largely clinical . I am wondering , though , how long it will take the police to arrive at the same conclusions that led me to you . I could help them . I may have to . I could kill you ! What good would that do ? Here . And no more of that silly business . Goodbye . And do n't come here again . I 'll call you if I need you . You know , press , I rather enjoy playing God . That 's strange
zone1	get in out of the rain . Oh , please , not the front door . I do n't feel quite up to facing the others just yet . There 's an outside stairway leading up to my room . I can slip in without anyone knowing it . Please explain to Victor . Tell him I 'll talk to him in a little while . Althea : Well , darling ... You completely missed the welcome mat we put out for you . Why , Althea , I-I was just putting on a suitable face for your triumphal return . I did n't expect to find you here . Well , welcome home anyway , darling . You look as though you 'd been fished out of several oceans . I need a little time to pull myself together . I 'm afraid you 'll have a long pull . I took your room over Because ... Naturally , of course , we did n't think you were going to come back . I suppose you 'll want me to leave now . I really do n't care .
zone1	find all of your things in my room . Oh , tell me one thing , darling . No , not about the shipwreck . I read enough about that in the newspapers . What I want to know is , how did you ever manage to catch a man like Steve Howard ? We always thought of you as such a quiet little mouse , and here you go and fool us all by snaring a millionaire husband . He isn't-a millionaire ? Oh , yes . Trust Victor to check on his financial background . Is n't it rather unfair ... You , with all the money in the world , and you marry more . And look at Oliver and me . Nobody ever left us a fortune , Neither one of us with a penny of our own . All we 've got is each other . Why are you looking at me like that ? I 'm not looking at you . I 'm seeing you for the first time . You think I 'm jealous . Why should you be ? I would never
zone1	away from me . If you are going to leave , perhaps you 'd better go now . You 'll probably want a hot bath before dinner . Yes , I do want a bath ... But I 'll take it here , in my own room . But you just said-I 've changed my mind , Althea ... About many things . You can move your clothes out after dinner . May I suggest you take a very hot bath ? I thought it was amnesia at first . Now I 'm not so sure . Either Matilda ca n't or wo n't remember our marriage . You seem to be confronted with an awkward . And somewhat delicate situation . What do I do ? Divorce ? Annulment ? Do I stay or do I go ? I think the wisest thing to do is to stay . Perhaps , in time , she 'll remember . Meanwhile , as I understand it , your marriage was merely ... Legal . I would suggest , then , that you remain on with us for the time being ...
zone1	. Jane . You must be miss Moynihan . I am , but must I be ? I 'm Steve Howard . Will you join me in a cocktail , Mr . Howard ? I 'd much rather be together when I 'm drinking . You appeal to my Chivalry , miss Moynihan . I shall regard that as definite encouragement , Mr . Howard . After slaving all day over a hot typewriter , There 's nothing I like better than a swan dive into a bottle of bourbon . Why , Oliver ! Waiting for the bar to open ? No , I 'm just sitting here in the dark , counting my sins . Without an adding machine ? You must n't be unpleasant , Jane . It has absolutely no effect . She 's back , is n't she ? Matilda ? Is she happy ? Or do you mean , has she forgotten you ? I 'm selfish enough to hope she has n't . Oh , you men , you dogs in the manger . I 'm not thinking about myself . I 'm
zone1	hurt twice , And she 's no match for Althea . Mr . Howard , do you think you could manage to make yourself . A little less attractive to my wife ? Try being nasty . I have . Try harder . I don't-Oliver , if you ask me , Althea should be taken out regularly . And beaten like a rug . Who is it ? Oh , Grandy ! There , there , there ... Angel , you 're home , you 're safe , And we 're never going to let you get lost again . You 're crying ? Now , now , now , do n't cry . Do n't cry . I ca n't help it . I 'm so mixed up . But you always were mixed up , my dear , And we 've always straightened things out for you . I should 've stayed away . I should never have come back . Not come back here ? But this is your home . Your father 's house . I never forget it ... Though I 'm afraid Althea and
zone1	, Grandy , never . But Althea-Now , you must n't blame Althea for marrying Oliver . She was in love with him . Course , I know what a blow . It must have been to your pride . It was more than pride . I was in love with him . Mm-hmm . Well , I think you 'll feel . Very differently when you see him . He 's changed , my dear ... And not for the better . And , of course , now that you 're Mrs . Steven Howard-Grandy , what do you know about Steven Howard ? That was going to be my question . He tells me you do n't remember marrying him . In fact , he says you do n't remember him at all . But I do n't . I did n't marry him . I do n't think I did . I 'm sure I 'd remember . I 'm sure you would , too . Unless ... Grandy , it could n't have been amnesia . Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh .
zone1	covering up things we want to forget . And I think Mr . Howard 's a very clever young man . Who has gone to a great deal of trouble . To make you believe you 're married to him . But why should he ? When we know the answer to that , my dear , We 'll know how to deal with him . What can we do ? Nothing . Just play along with him ... For the present . We 'll keep this to ourselves , shall we ? Imagine what the newspapers would do with it . When the time comes , I 'll know how to cope with him . Now , are you going to get your hair fixed before coming down to dinner ? Grandy , would you mind terribly . If I did n't come down tonight ? I 'm so tired . Of course you are . You know , this house was lonely for you . It seemed so gray and depressing while you were gone . Now it 's bright . You 're alive again . So am
zone1	inquire where you 've been ? I 'm sorry , sir . I mean . I 'm sorry , sir . I did n't know you were up , sir . Mr . Howard asked me to drive him to the station . At this hour of the morning ? He wanted to catch The 7:15 . Only thieves and home-going Casanovas catch the 7:15 train in the morning . Well , he took it . Did he take any luggage with him ? No , sir . No luggage , sir . Did you want something , sir ? Breakfast , if it is n't asking too much . Asking too much . Yes , sir . I mean , no , sir . Kent : Yes , sir . Sorry I was late . I always have more face to put on in the morning . Drive on , please . Did Victor See you leave ? I do n't think so . What about your reporter friend ? Did he come through ? Yeah . He got these out of the file . Good . I 'll
zone1	You were right . I checked . You 've certainly been a big help , Jane . I 'll do all I can , Steve . We 're going through with it just as we planned . You 'll be at the house tonight ? Mm-hmm . Fine . If I do n't get back in time for dinner , I 'll phone Victor my apologies . Please be careful . I will . I 'm afraid he 's suspicious . Why ? I told him Matilda did n't recognize me . Naturally , he liked that . Of course . A husband to share his ward 's millions . Is the last thing he wants . Did you bring that letter Roslyn wrote you ? Yes . I put it in my bag this morning . Written the day before she died . Does n't sound much like a girl who was tired of living , does it ? Oh , you do n't have to sell me , Steve . I know as well as you do that Roslyn never committed suicide . Matilda . It 's nice
zone1	that all it means to you ? What did you expect ? Why , Matilda , what a lovely gown . Hello , Althea . Thank you . I bought it in Rio . Oh . Grandy ! If that 's a Brazilian gown , I 'll leave for Argentina tomorrow . Well , our sleeping beauty has awakened at last . You look radiant , my lamb , but then , you should , Having slept the clock round . I needed the rest to face tonight . I 'm sorry I was so silly , but ever since I knew I was coming home , I 've dreaded this moment . And what about now ? It 's the first time I 've felt at ease ... As though I belonged here . Of course you belong here . Cheers . Come along , my dear . We have a vermouth cassis for you . Hello , Nancy . Welcome home , miss . Good evening , Kent . It 's nice to have you back , miss Matilda . Why , thank you . We missed you
zone1	. Uh , uh , do n't ... move , my dear . Do you know you 've changed ? I have ? Oliver : No , Matilda has n't changed ... The painting has . It just died . Oh ... I have n't seen Roslyn yet . Oh , hello , Ro- Well , hello , Jane . Hello , darling . You look wonderful . Would a shipwreck do that for me ? Every girl should have one at least twice a year . I thought you were Roslyn . I 've been making a few changes in Victor 's script . Our writers have been shipwrecked for some time now . Thought I 'd finish it before dinner sets in . It 's good to see you . Where is Roslyn ? You have n't heard ? Heard ? What ? Roslyn 's dead . She was found hanging from that chandelier . Oh , no ! Oh , no ! Jane : Hello ? Yes , just a moment , please . Victor ... telephone . Here . Thank you . Hello ? Victor ?
zone1	to see you . My dear fellow , I 'm on the verge of dining . After dinner , then . I 'm afraid I must insist . I 'm sorry . It 's very important . Very well , if you 're going to be unpleasant about it . Come along at 9:00 . I 'll give you some poisoned coffee . Good . I 'll see you then . You want to keep her letter ? No . No , I think I have everything I need right here . Bring me the file on the Roslyn Wright suicide . Ok , chief . One of the newspapers took this picture . You were standing here , in front of the electric clock . Victor : I do n't understand . Look what time the clock says in the picture . 9:35 . What does that mean ? The way we figure it , there was a struggle . This lamp was knocked over . That caused a short circuit and blew out a fuse downstairs . That stopped the clock and gives us the exact time of
zone1	's important . Take these books . The murderer arranged them so that we 'd think . That Roslyn had used them to reach the chandelier . Mystery of the Headless Corpse . I read that . That 's not bad . Quite a good detective in it . Uh , go on . Hmm ? Oh , yes . Well , now we come to the point . The phone company keeps a record . Of all long-distance calls . At exactly 9:34 that night , A call was put through from New York to this phone . Roslyn answered it . That means she must have seen the murderer . Now , what we want to know is , Why have n't we heard from whoever put through that call ? And most important of all ... Who hung up this phone ? Of course . Roslyn could n't have done it . Right . Very extraordinary . Do you know , I think you 've discovered . Something terribly important . Why , it changes the entire complexion of the case . How did you manage to
zone1	our department is . Well , I certainly hope you run this down . Poor child . Whatever could have been the motive ? When we know that , we 'll know who killed her . Matilda . I did n't mean to frighten you . You think you can keep avoiding me forever ? Oh , Oliver , I 'm not avoiding you . There 's so much I want to say to you . I 've got to say to you . Look at me , Matilda . You know , once , I would n't have . Been able to look at you ... Without remembering . Now it does n't seem to matter . Victor is right . You have changed . And you , Oliver ? Are you the same ambitious young man who was going to change the course of history ? Or are you- a drunk ? Is that what you 're trying to say ? It is n't important now . It is to me . Tonight when I saw you , I realized what I 've been running away from all
zone1	. Does n't that mean anything to you ? I 'm sorry . Is it because you 're married ? Because you 're in love with Steve Howard ? Yes ... Maybe that is what I mean . Hello . Good evening . Do you mind if we have a look in the cellar ? I 'd like to check on the fuse system . You know the way . I do n't expect to find anything , But it wo n't hurt to look . Well , Victor , you finally have . A murder case in your own home . Yes . Murder ? ! What did he mean ? My dear ... Tell me , Grandy ! What is it ? Roslyn did n't Kill herself . She was murdered . Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . It 's right through here and down the stairs . I 'll get the light . Watch your step . Mm-hmm . Boy , look at all that vino . You watch your step . You know , when I was in Okinawa , We went
zone1	Yeah . Right over here . Living room ... Seems to work . Library ... But why ? What reason could anyone have ? I do n't suppose we 'll ever know , poor child . I 'm afraid this has n't been a very happy homecoming . Oh , make them stop ! Make them stop ! There , there ... Oh , it 's just coming home ... And now this . I know , my dear . It 's all been too much for you . Come along . Come along . Kent , do you ever cheat at solitaire ? Cheat ? Oh , no , miss . I do , and I hate myself for it . Oh ... There it goes again . I wonder what 's wrong with the lights ? Nothing . You 're going blind . Uh , blind-Blind ? Well , Victor ... Hmm ? Oh ... Yeah , you 've been down in the cellar , have n't you ? What did you find ? Nothing of any importance . Before we go , we 'd like to talk
zone1	. Howard . Modern marriage is beyond me . Well , ask her to drop in my office in the morning . There are one or two things I 'd like to talk to her about . Of course , yes . By the way , Victor , it 's purely routine , of course , But where were you the night of Roslyn 's murder ? Doing my broadcast- " The Morgan Affair . " Do n't you remember ? You gave me the-Now , do n't tell me that you were n't listening . That 's the one I missed . What train did you take that night . The 8:30 or the 9:00 ? My dear fellow , it 's very obvious that you 've missed . More than one of my broadcasts , Or you 'd know that I 'm not off the air until 8:30 . I always catch the later train . That does n't get here until 9:55 . 10 minutes from the station to here ... Means you got home At 10:05 . Very precise . Why is this so-Oh , I
zone1	do n't think you needed it very much , But it 's good to have things settled . Mr . Donovan , do you mind driving me in ? I 'm afraid to go home alone . You 'll be quite safe with us . That 's what I was afraid of . Good night , Victor . Good night . Jane : I 'm always missing that train , but I do meet interesting people hitchhiking this way . It 's not very flattering . Been looking at your watch all evening . Sorry . You know , you implied a great deal . When you asked me to come out here . What 's the matter ? Have you changed your mind ? No , I have n't changed my mind . You 're a funny guy , Steve . Am I ? Been a long time since I met anyone . That interested me half as much as you do , And that 's a gross understatement . You need a drink . No , Oliver . Let me take care of this . You go back
zone1	. Do as I say . Oh , come on , Steve . Come on and sit down beside me . I 'm lonely-terribly lonely . Bored , maybe . Bored and lonely . You think because I live in this house , Basking in Victor 's glory and Matilda 's money , that I like it . I hate it ! I like to break things . Glass breaking is the most wonderful sound in the whole world . Why do n't you like Matilda ? She 's been very kind to you . Kind ? She can afford to be . Her father left her millions . My father died without a cent . Victor had to take me in . His penniless niece . He was glad to take her in-very glad . " The Little Heiress . " It 's all I 've heard from the time I was 10 years old . Do n't you think you 've had enough ? I suppose so . I usually do n't drink this much . So I 'll know what I 'm saying-The proper questions , the
zone1	going to be careless ... And talk too much . You do n't know what it is to have to say thank you to somebody you do n't like for everything you get-day after day , year after year ! I never had anything of my own . Until I thought she was dead . Then Victor gave me everything I ever wanted . And now she 's back , and all I 've got is ... Oliver . But Victor could continue to do things for you . How ? Victor has very expensive tastes . Takes every cent he makes to live the way he does-More than every cent . Oh , why did she have to come back ? Now I have had too much to drink . I was just beginning to get interested . Interested or curious ? Both . I keep wondering . About the girl who was murdered-Victor 's secretary . Roslyn ? She was n't murdered . She killed herself . She was murdered . The police have evidence . How do you know ? I gave it to them . You
zone1	. I can take care of myself . Easy , Althea . All right ... I do know something . I talked to Roslyn that night . I heard her scream . Victor , I 've made up my mind . I 'm going away . What about your wife ? My wife ? I have no claims on Althea . She belongs to mankind . I think you 've made a very wise decision . You 've been very patient with Althea ... Entirely too patient . Going away , if only for a few days , will teach her a much needed lesson . Just exactly what lesson is Althea to be taught ? The lesson of humility , my dear . You see , Oliver is leaving you . Did you have anything to do with this ? Sounds like one of your clever little plots . No , it was my own idea . Really ? An idea of your own ? You see , Oliver has become aware of your-What shall I call it ? - Your attachment to Mr . Howard , And ,
zone1	it hurting Matilda . Oh . The knight to the rescue . Are you carrying her on your white charger ? No . From now on , I ride alone . Who 's going to pry you loose from the bar ? I think you 'd better excuse me . I detest scenes not of my own making . You know , the more I see of marriage , The more thankful I am to be the last . Of a long line of bachelors . What 's gotten into you , Oliver ? I 'd rather not have a quarrel , if you do n't mind . I 'm not going to swoon at the idea of losing you , But I am entitled to an explanation . All right , I 'll give you one-Carefully selected 4- letter words . You 're not fooling anyone . I 've been watching you ever since . You knew Matilda was coming home . You 're still in love with her , are n't you ? Are n't you ? ! As a matter of fact , I am . Well
zone1	do you think I married you ? Because of your charm ? I only married you for one reason , and that was to get you away from Matilda . And I 'll do the very same thing with Steve . You 're going to leave him alone . Do you hear me ? You 're not going to cause her any more unhappiness , or-I do n't like to be threatened . I can threaten , too . It will give me a great deal of pleasure . To break up our dear little Matilda 's marriage . I 'll kill you first . Really ? You plan to shoot me , stab me , or , uh ... String me up like poor Roslyn ? Oh , I 'm fed up with your cheap heroics ! Go on , get out of here ! Please , please . Althea , Oliver ... You have no idea how your voices carry . I can hear you from the other end of the house . Well , then get him out of here . We 'll discuss that later .
zone1	. Oliver , be smart . Pack your bag , enough things for a few days , And go right away from here . All right , Victor . You know best . Ah ... Ca n't we postpone this lecture till some other time ? This room gives me the creeps . I like it . The outside world is so far away in here . I ca n't hear it ... it ca n't hear me . That 's why I had the room soundproofed ... So I can be completely alone . Completely undisturbed . What is it you wanted to speak to me about ? A phone call , my dear . The phone call you put through to this house . The night that Roslyn was murdered . The phone call that Mr . Donovan has succeeded in tracing . The one with which you aroused . Mr . Howard 's interest a few minutes ago . I did n't say anything to him . Oh , dear . I 've tried so hard to teach you the value of truth . You see ,
zone1	eavesdroppers never hear any good of themselves , But I thought it was rather unfriendly of you . To accuse me of having murdered Roslyn . You ca n't frighten me . You would n't dare do anything to me ! I want the truth , Althea . Did you or did you not tell Mr . Howard . That I murdered Roslyn ? Yes . I said I thought so . And why did n't you share your suspicion . With the police , or at least tell them of the phone call ? I was afraid of what would happen to you . Always thinking of your dear uncle . That 's right . Sit down . You and I were enjoying Matilda 's money , were n't we ? Now that she 's come back , What do you suppose is going to happen to you ? You 'll take care Of me , Victor . You must have money hidden away- money Matilda could never trace . You and Roslyn had one trait in common : You were both much too inquisitive . Oh ... So
zone1	's a pity , is n't it ? You were always my favorite . You know that , do n't you ? So charmingly unscrupulous ... But so greedy . It 's too bad . Oh , no ! No , do n't ! Do n't shoot ! Do n't ! Victor ? Victor ? Oliver . Victor , I wanted to tell you that I 'm leaving . If I could call a cab-You 'll do nothing of the kind . With a garage full of cars ? Here 's the key to the coupe . You use my hotel room in town for a couple of days . I 'll call the clerk and tell them to expect you . Tomorrow , you and Althea are going to feel very differently about this . I 'll get your coat for you . Here you go , Oliver . Thanks , Victor . Thanks for everything . Not at all . Good luck . And do n't forget you 've been drinking , Oliver . Drive carefully . I will . Matilda , I ... I saw your light
zone1	n't keep running away from me . You-you might have phoned . Anyway , I have nothing to say to you . Is that perfectly clear ? Perfectly . But you 're going to listen to me , just the same . You 're in a great deal of danger . You 've got to get out of this house . Are n't you being a little bit theatrical ? Maybe I am ... But your life wo n't be worth much if Victor finds out what Althea 's been telling me . What are you talking about ? Oliver did n't break your engagement because he wanted to . It was all arranged by Victor . That 's not true . And if Roslyn had been warned as I 'm warning you , she 'd be alive today . Roslyn ? Do n't you realize it 's because I want to help you ? Because I . Do n't want anything to happen to you . You 've got to trust me , Matilda . Oh , Steve , I want to . I 'd like to believe you
zone1	n't believe Grandy would do anything to hurt me . Althea , on recording : You 're not fooling anyone . I 've been watching you ever since you knew Matilda was coming home . You 're still in love with her , are n't you ? Are n't you ? ! Oliver , on recording : As a matter of fact , I am . Well , it wo n't do you any good . Why do you think I married you ? Because of your charm ? I only married you for one reason , And that was to get you away from Matilda . Matilda ! Matilda , it 's Oliver and Althea . They 've been drinking . I 've never seen a man in such a blind rage . You 're the only one he 'll listen to . Why , Howard . I had no idea ... Come along , Matilda . Break up our dear little Matilda 's marriage . I 'll kill you first . Really ? Oh , no ! No , do n't ! Do n't shoot ! Do n't
zone1	. Oh , this is awful ! No sign of him . He must have gotten away . Operator ... Get me police headquarters , please . Code number 99 . Hard-top , light gray coupe . New York , 4h23022 . Probably using Sawmill River Highway . Caution-Man is armed . Repeating . Code number ... Rifling checks on the bullets . The bullet that killed Althea was fired from this gun . Well , I suppose that makes it official . You can add , Steve . Two plus two equals-Oliver . My addition does n't come out the same . Ca n't argue with mathematics . I 'm sorry . As far as this department is concerned , The case is closed . Thanks anyway , Donovan . Goodbye . Goodbye . Two cups ? Yes , I like to drink with two hands . I 'm sorry , Jane . The train was late . That 's all right . Lemon , please . Lemon . You 're just in time to keep me from drinking something that would do me no harm . Why did
zone1	. I just thought you might like to get away from that house for a while . It 's been awful . The police questioning , the funeral ... Was n't very cheerful . How could it be ? I mean , it 's so big that even the closets have an echo . Why , there 's Steve ! Fancy finding you here . Small world , is n't it ? Yes . Come on over and sit down . If you do n't mind . Hello , Matilda . Hello , Steve . Oh , my goodness , I just remembered . I forgot an appointment . I 've got to go downtown and match a goldfish . Goodbye . Is everything all right , Mrs . Howard ? My dear , sweet man , will you do me a favor-A very big favor ? Yes , ma'am . Get lost . Yes , ma'am . Is there anything Else , sir ? No , that will be All , thank you . Thank you , sir . Very conscientious waiter . He wants to give me My
zone1	, I bribed him . To call any woman he saw me with " Mrs . Howard . " Then we 're not married . No . You see , I had to get into Grandison 's house , And the only way I could do it was to pretend we were . I had to find out why Roslyn died . Steve , did you know Roslyn ? Yes . We grew up together . It was sort of taken for granted we 'd be married someday . I suppose we would 've if it had n't been for the war . I 'm sorry . I had n't seen her for over 3 years . When I came back from overseas , she was dead . Her aunt and uncle never believed , and neither did I , That she 'd committed suicide . Her uncle had seen her only the day before she died . He was the man who was supposed to have married us-Judge Maynard . Naturally , he was interested . In finding out what really happened to his niece . I , uh
zone1	, Matilda . You were a very convincing liar . The words were lies . The emotions were honest . And I want to be sure that nothing happens to you . Nothing can . Oliver 's dead . Oliver did n't kill anybody . The same thing happened to him . That happened to Althea and Roslyn . He was murdered by your kind , generous guardian , Victor Grandison . Look , Steve , I do n't know why you hate Grandy so much , but I will not listen to you saying such things about him . Listen to me ! For the last two days , I 've been running down all the scattered clues . Victor 's very clever , but I think I know how he managed . For us to hear the argument between Oliver and Althea . He had an alibi the night Roslyn died . He said he was at the broadcast . And could n't have caught that early train . I listened to a record of that broadcast , and timed it . He left early that night .
zone1	Maybe he had , but that does n't prove he did . I 'll never believe it . Oh , Steve , I wish it did n't have to be like this . If you only knew how much I liked you , You would n't try to make me believe that Grandy-Do n't you see it ? I do n't want to talk about it ! Matilda ! Just leave me alone ! Do n't go back there , Matilda ! Anything wrong , Mrs . Howard ? So he finally admitted that you were n't married , after all . Very interesting ... Not married , never have been . I suppose I should hate him . And do you ? Of course you do n't . In spite of what he 's done and said about me , I think you 're in love with him , are n't you ? Are n't you ? Yes , I guess I am in love with him . And I feel like such a traitor to you . But why should you ? This has been a dreadful misunderstanding
zone1	and Steven are going to live happily ever after . Then you do n't object ? My dear , I can be philosophical about everything ... Including love , which seems to me to be a curiously unhappy blend of tears and laughter . But if that 's what you want , You have my blessing . Oh , Grandy ! If he only knew you as I do . If he only knew you as you really are ! Perhaps he does , my dear . Perhaps he does . Well , this is n't ... Getting on with my radio script for tonight . I , uh ... I do n't know what happened to Jane . She should be here . She knows I have to dictate these gruesome things . I could help you , Grandy . I used to . Remember ? Oh , of course you did . Yes . Come on over here . Not as efficiently as Jane , but if you 'll go slowly-Oh , yes . I 'll go slowly . Now , uh , now this is uh ...
zone1	. No , no , do n't ... do n't put that down . I 'm just explaining the story . Mary Phillips has just seen her parents ... brutally murdered , and feels that she can no longer live without them . Now , her farewell note must be simple , yet convincing . Now , let me ... See . Uh ... " Having lost two who Were most dear to me , " I find life empty , Bitter ... " and too lonely . " Got that ? " May those who are my friends try to forgive me " for taking this way out ... " Of a cruel and uncompromising world . " There 's Your Steven Howard . He 's on his way down to the garage . Now we 'll ... Wipe all the shadows away . Why , your eyes are shining , but in such a woebegone little face . Now , you ... You run along and change it , and fix yourself , because this is going to be a moment you 'll always remember . And I
zone1	all alone with my memories , darling , of your sweetness and your tender affection for me . Grandy , do n't talk like that . Even if I did marry Steve , I would n't be leaving you forever . Besides , I do n't know how he feels about me . We 'll find that out . Just leave it to me . Oh , and , uh , Remember ... Look your prettiest . Yeah ? I know who it is . I need you . Yes . Will you come along as soon as you can , please ? I 'll be waiting for you in the garage . Thank you . Press . You made good time . Hello , Kent . I thought This was your night off . It is , sir , but the others had left , and I thought-Oh , nonsense . Of course you can go . Here . Take a couple of tickets for my broadcast tonight . Thank you , sir , but your program frightens me . I do n't like it . Do you like
zone1	not fooling anyone . I 've been watching you ever since you knew Matilda was coming home . You 're still in love with her , are n't you ? Are n't you ? ! Althea , on recording : Oh , no ! No , do n't ! Do n't shoot ! Do n't ! Get me police headquarters . Donovan , homicide . Donovan , this is Steve Howard . I-Hello ? Operator , there seems to be some trouble on this line . Can you clear it ? Thank you . Hello ? If you 'll call me back at Croton 48305 . That 's right . Hello , Mr . Grandison . Hello , Mr . Howard . Just why are you here ? To pick up my belongings . I trust you have everything you came for . Almost . Are n't you forgetting ... Matilda ? No , I have n't forgotten Matilda . I 've been very patient with you , young man ... Extremely patient . You enter my house-Matilda 's house . You enter this house under false pretenses . You
zone1	belongings . You delude us all into believing in this fantastic marriage . Did it ever occur to you that I could have you arrested as an impostor ? Yes , it did ... but an arrest and trial with the evidence it would bring out ? You have a great deal of courage , Mr . Grandison , But not that much . I do n't know what 's going on in the back of your mind , But whatever it is , I shall be very interested to see what happens to you . I hope you wo n't be disappointed , Mr . Grandison . I was just leaving . I want to talk to you . Yes , I talked to Victor . Come to the guesthouse right away . I 'll be down in just a minute . Use the outside stairway . Hurry , darling . Steve ? Steve ! Oh , hello , Press . Hello , miss . Grandy ! Grandy ... Now what ? Where have you been ? What were you doing Out there ? Steve called me from the
zone1	, and his car is n't in the garage . I saw Press . Oh , I should 've asked Press about Steve . Perhaps He can tell me-You stay here . Have you taken leave of your senses-Running about out there , chasing this man , screaming with hysteria ? But , Grandy , Steve might-Steve ? Steve ? Is that all you can think about ? Is that all you can talk about ? If you do n't get hold of yourself , your mind will crack . I 'm sorry , my dear . I 'm afraid I 've behaved rather badly . You did n't believe a word I said , did you ? It 's just that I ... Well , today , I seem to have reached the breaking point . My nerves are ragged , what with Jane not showing up . To help me with the broadcast , And Steve 's abrupt appearance ... Oh , that reminds me . I could have spared us both this disagreeable scene . Steve had some trouble with his car . He took the car
zone1	tell you that he 'd be right back . But why did n't you tell me before ? Oh , that 's easily explained . We 've all been a little upset . It would be a miracle if we were n't . But are you going to forgive your crusty old Grandy ? What we need is something for our nerves . We 'll have a little wine , and we 'll talk this thing over calmly and logically . Come along , Matilda . Come on . This will bring the sparkle back to your eyes . Well , do n't you want to drink with me ? No , thank you , Grandy . You do n't want Steven to come back and find you looking like a ghost , do you ? To please me . You know I do n't like drinking alone . I wonder if that's-I 'll take it . Hello ? It 's 10 minutes . I 'm Calling , like you said . Hello , Steve . Well , I 'm certainly glad you called . We were worried about you
zone1	uh ... She 's right here . In 20 minutes ? Let me talk to him . Yes , I 'll tell her , Steve . What ? Let me talk to him . Just a minute , Steve . She wants to talk to you . Hello , Steve . Hello ? Hello ? Oh ... He must have hung up . Do you think he 'll call back ? Why should he ? He said he 'd be here in 20 minutes , As soon as the car is . I 'm going to be late for my rehearsal . Here . Here 's to you both . Is n't this wine a little bitter ? " Dry " is the word , dear-dry . Let me fill it up for you . That will be enough , thank you . I feel much better . Good . It 's my best vintage- ' 28 . Oh , it 's wonderful . Oh , I feel so relaxed . That 's how I want you to feel . Finish it , my dear . Finish it . I
zone1	far away , Grandy . So far away ... Can you hear me , Matilda ? Can you hear me ? So far away ... I 've never been closer to you . You must n't say that , Steve . Grandy 's always been kind to me-always . Oh ... I 'll miss you ... Steve ... Steve ... " Having lost two who were most dear to me , " I find life empty , bitter , and too lonely . May those who are my friends try to forgive me for taking this way out . " Of a cruel and uncompromising world . " Steve ! Steve ! Steve ... Steve ? Steve ! Careful . Wake up , Matilda . Open your eyes . You 're doing fine . Wake up , Matilda ! You better keep on walking her , chief . On your feet . That 's right . No , come on . Walk . Walk . That 's it . Get me some coffee . Tried to kill me . He would have if Steve had n't phoned me . Here
zone1	at ... General description . Blue body , red wheels . Feeling all right ? License-2h470j . That 's it - Press ' truck . Hmm ? I remember I saw it parked in front of the garage . Press . This is Donovan calling headquarters on that 48 you just broadcast . Make that a general two-state alarm . Notify all bridges , tunnels , and ferries . I 'm headed for the riverfront . It 's Donovan again . We just passed Willow Street . All right , give it to me . That 's it . Keep on it . I think we 've got him now . Hold it ! Hold it ! Stop that crate ! Drop the-Lower the trunk ! Once again , the United Motors Company , makers of fine automobiles for nearly half a century , present your genial host , the renowned writer , art collector , and teller of strange tales , Victor Grandison . Good evening , ladies and gentlemen . Grandison speaking . I have another story to bring you-An amusing and delightfully stirring saga of assorted mayhem
zone1	on a winter 's evening 40 years or more ago . I give you , " The Tragedy of The Missing Head . " It is not difficult to imagine the feelings of-of the-uh , the feelings of Henry Roberts , for that is the name of our murderer ... Um ... Hmm ? When he came downstairs that cold Christmas eve and found his dear wife lying before the fireplace , dead ... at the base of the Christmas tree , its-At the base of the Christmas tree , its ornaments tinkling , an elfin counterpoint to the caroling outside . Ladies and ... gentlemen , you 're about to experience something unprecedented in the history of our program ... or , for that matter , of radio itself . And you who have followed my adventures . In the half-world of Crime for so many years now ... you are listening to my last broadcast . Shall I cut him off ? No . He started this . Let him finish it his own way . For a time , the unsuspected wore his mask safely . Not
zone1	necessary to commit two murders more-A young woman who shared His ominous secret ... And her husband ... Who begin to see how enmeshed he became in his own incredible folly . Would you like to know who the unsuspected really is ? It is I . I am the unsuspected ... Your genial host ... Victor Grandison . Good night .
zone1	5883516 This is the story of a squad of marines , a rifle squad . I 'm Corporal Robert Dunne , a member of that squad . We were at Guadalcanal , and when it was secure we were pulled out for rest , refitting , replacements and retraining . The Marine Corps is long on training and retraining ... Let that go . After the canal , we were sent to Camp Paekakariki in New Zealand . Here we received our replacements , marines from Stateside , a long way from Stateside , 8,000 miles . I can see you 're a man who knows how to live . - Solid comfort . - Solid malaria . - Malaria , huh ? Contagious ? - No , not this week . You can stay . Nice place you got here . Regazzi 's my name , Benny Regazzi . Bob Dunne . I 'm duty NCO today . Great . Meet my friends . This big guy is " Handsome " Dan Shipley . - Hi . - What a physique ! The girls see him and faint . He comes through this , I 'll make him a
zone1	's Eddie and that 's Frank . - Hi , Eddie . - Hello , Bob . They do n't drink . I got their beer ration . - And Georgie Hellenopolis , an Irishman . - Hello , sport . - Where did you get those cards ? - Off your sack on the ship . Why ? - They 're mine , that 's why . - I 've seen lots in those bags that aren't . - Come on , give me . - " Semper fi " , Mac . - Hey ! - Leave them . It happens 20 times a day . You know where those guys come from ? Philadelphia , the city of brotherly love . - By the way , who 's the squad leader ? - Sergeant Stryker . - What 's he like ? - You 'll find out . I 've been in New Zealand two hours and already they 're clamming up on me . - I hope he knows his stuff . - Maybe we 'll get liberty . - We ai n't replacements any more
zone1	? He 's here . - Well , what do you know ? Stryker . - Hello , Thomas . - Thought you were in the First . - I was . Sit down . Just sit down , Thomas , anywhere . My name is Stryker , Sergeant John M Stryker . You 're gon na be my squad , a rifle squad . Three of us have seen action : Corporal Dunne , Charlie Bass and myself . You 'll learn from us . In boot camp you learned out of a book . Here you got ta remember the book and learn things that have n't been printed . You got ta learn right and fast . Any man that does n't want to cooperate , I 'll make him wish he had n't been born . Before I 'm through with you , you 're gon na move and think like one man . If you do n't , you 'll be dead . You guys have had a nice easy day . I hope you enjoyed it because it 's the last one you 'll
zone1	to fight and you 'll get your chance . I 'll show you how . If I ca n't teach you one way , I 'll teach you another . But I 'll get the job done . The skipper of this outfit is Captain Joyce . Platoon leader is Lieutenant Baker . Platoon sergeant is Sergeant Wright . Any questions ? That 's all . 10,000 sergeants in this corps and I draw Stryker ! You knew this guy before ? Yeah . We were stationed together in China . Twice he kept me from promotion . Turned me in once . 30 days I got . He was a sergeant major then . Must have done something to get busted to three stripes . What did he turn you in for ? For ... That 's not important ! What 's important is that he turned me in ! Maybe he did n't write the manual , but you can bet he can recite it backwards ! - It 's probably tattooed on his chest . - Front and back , Mac . - Say , is n't
zone1	n't you a fighter ? - Just in the Marines . - Runner-up in the heavyweight division . - Tell him who you were runner-up to . Stryker . Lucky punch . Meet your new manager . Tell him why you lost your stripes . My natural dislike for you is gradually developing into a great hate . Do n't let this guy do your thinking . You 'll get a square deal from Stryker . You bet . Square deal . I 'm looking forward to the first time he and I come head to head off duty . Hey , take it easy with that hand , champ ! Saddle up ! - All right , take a break . - Take a break . - How does your squad look ? - See me in about six months . Conway ! I was checking the records . Your father was Colonel Sam Conway . - What if he was ? - I was with him ten months ago . He was my CO before he got killed . One of the best officers and finest men I
zone1	- Thanks . I 'll keep it in mind . - For that , you sleep with your rifle . - It was an accident . - Nobody in this outfit drops their rifle . - Fall in ! All right , saddle up . Pick it up . Sometimes I do n't know which I hate worse , him or the Nips . - Your father was a good marine . - Until ten months ago . - You shipped in when he was killed . - I shipped in because I was expected to . In war the men of my family join the Marines . I 'm the last Conway , so here I am . He 'd be proud that you 're carrying on the tradition . Not my father . He 'd have expected me to find some soft duty somewhere . - In fact , he told me so . - I do n't get it . I embarrassed my father . I was n't tough enough for him . Too soft . " No guts " was the phrase he used . He
zone1	man I ever served under . " I bet they got along just fine . Both with ramrods strapped on their backs . I 'm a civilian , not a marine . They 're not going to strap one on mine . I 'm in here strictly for tradition . - That the only reason ? - Yeah . Why ? Nothing ... Stryker knows his business . So did Jack the Ripper . Knock off the skylarking . You 're in the wrong column . Left foot close in there . Look alive ! Choynski , you 're all left feet ! Choynski ! What do you think you 're doing ? - Running the bayonet course , sir . - Not in this league . Yes , sir . Your men are pretty ragged , Stryker . Yes , sir . That ought to take some starch out of Stryker . His boys did n't do so well . Hanging him up between those poles , we 'd do a lot better . Choynski ! OK , so I 'm left-handed . - On guard . Give me
zone1	n't learn the easy way , you 'll learn the hard way . Make a thrust . - Without a scabbard ? - You heard me . - You mean this way ? - Yeah , like this ! You get the idea ? Corpsman ! All right , saddle up . We 'll do it again . Pick it up . You 're the only unkissable guy in camp . This thing hurts . It ai n't funny . No dame 's going to come near a mouth like this . Do n't worry , I got the scoop . No liberty for three months . You got time . - Three months ? How did you get that ? - I got spies everywhere . They ought to throw the book at Stryker for doing this . They wo n't . They 'll give him a citation for teaching us to be good marines . Choynski ! They tell me you 're going to live . You were lucky today . Someone had been instructing you that did n't like you , you might not have been .
zone1	course . Somebody who did n't like me ? I wonder what he does to the guys he hates . 365 days in a year and I got ta pick this one to nick myself ! You need a blow torch on your stubble . Look who 's putting out the scuttlebutt . No liberty , he says ! Somebody made a mistake . You got no kick coming . You have , so do n't go turning your back . Will we take Hollywood with them physiques ! - First Platoon ! - That 's for me ! - Here , Wright , any mail for Stryker ? - No . It 's going to be rugged again tonight . He wo n't solve his problems with whiskey . What would you do if your wife left with your kid ? - After five years I 'd forget it . - Stryker 's not much on forgetting . - Sorry , no letter for you . - I know it . You know ten-year-olds . There could be a thousand reasons why he did n't write . - A
zone1	out ? - Brushing me . The kid 's all right . - Maybe Mary influenced him not to . - That she would n't do . Of course not . Stryker , you 're a very unusual character . - Can this be love ? - You know what I mean . A lot of guys would n't see that a woman needs a husband who 's not always away . A woman wants a home and a guy to come in and out on time every day . - You can tell me to shut up . - If you ca n't talk to me , who can ? - Do n't do it , just for once , do n't do it . - Do what ? Do n't start out to get blind , staggering , stinking , falling down drunk . Nobody starts out to get blind , staggering , stinking , falling down drunk . Some do . Why not leave half your dough with me ? You got an old maid 's failings . You worry . Do n't try to follow me
zone1	head of yours . - Ready ? - Just a minute . - What 's up ? - Nothing . Benny did n't strip his M1 fast enough for Stryker , so he turned him in . They cancelled his liberty . Perhaps our sergeant has n't got a heart of gold after all , but he certainly is ... You talk too much . You think I restricted Flynn for my own amusement ? The punishment 's unreasonable , to cancel his liberty for a minor mistake . I 'm gon na tell you something , Conway . I 'm gon na tell all of you . I 'm gon na make it simple so you 'll all understand it . They handed me you guys as a present , a regular Easter basket . They told me to get you into shape so you can handle a piece of this war . That 's what I 'm gon na do and that means I 'm gon na tell you what to do every day , how to button your buttons and when to blow your noses . If
zone1	na jump and when I land it 'll hurt . I 'll ride you until you ca n't stand up . When you do , you 'll be marines . Flynn stays here . Extra-hard product of a hard school . Tough luck , Flynn . - If my brother does n't go , I 'm not going . - Shut up ! - Who are you telling to shut up ? - You ! Let 's go before we all lose our liberty . I wan na see those Wellington babes . - How do you feel , boy ? - Like a little bird with feathers on it . - Do n't fly away , little bird . - I ca n't . I 'm still in the egg . Beautiful , beautiful ! I wan na dance . You 're gon na sit down . Yes , ma'am , Tennessee , that 's where I come from . The greatest state in the Union . They call it the volunteer state . Right there is where I 'm from . Smithville , Tennessee , what a town
zone1	side and these are on my papa 's side . We got the best tobacco there is , too . More fertiliser comes from Tennessee than any other place in the world . Listen to that band ! Zombies ! They 're all dead . - Maybe they like music that way here . - Or do n't know any other kind . - I 'm talking these boys into a session . - Maybe they do n't have it in them . After I 'm through , they will . They 're breaking my heart . Beautiful , beautiful , beautiful ! - There is a happy man . - Wait until tomorrow . - Do n't be a killjoy , dance . I 'll watch him . - I 'm not much on dancing . - You might try just this once . - No , thanks . - Pete 's my name , Pete Conway . - Allison . - Hello , Allison . - Hello , Pete . - You 're warm . Want to sit down ? - No . I do n't want to
zone1	, Mac . What would you say if I suggested we get some air ? I 'd say I 'm not supposed to leave the club with servicemen , but to you I 'd say yes . Now what ? We know all about each other . - You 'll be missing your train . - I 'll float back on thin air . Do n't do that . You might catch cold . Funny , I 've just met you and I feel I 've known you all my life . I feel that way , too . - Ten thousand miles away . - Not now . I wan na see you again , every time I get liberty . I 'll be here . - Allison ... - Yes ? I 'm glad I met you tonight . - The train ... - I know . I 'll walk you to the station . I can get a taxi from there . - No , I 'll walk you home . - No . You might miss your train . I might not see you again for
zone1	she says , just call her up . Man , what a barmaid ! - I 'll finish the war right here . - Drink any more and you probably will ! New Zealand ai n't got rats because they killed them all with that whiskey ! We 'll drink worse before we get through . They may bury me at sea tomorrow , but tonight I got that nice , warm feeling . I got a great future for the next two hours . You 're bleeding ! Lipstick ! - Hey , fellas , look what I found ! - Hey , sports ... look . - Boy , he 's really carrying a load ! - Gyrene ! Hey , Mac , you 're a little off your course . - Well , what do you know ! Stryker . - He 's sure a mess . Now I know what happened to those stripes . Come on . Shore Patrol . - That 's what it is . Give me a hand . - You 're going to help him ? If he cut my mother
zone1	them get him . What a break ! He 's all set to drop two stripes and Shore Patrol shows up . - But look what he done to me ! - Do n't tell me he kissed you . That 's a great one ! Did I tell you about the guy on a train and the funniest thing happened ... - I do n't know why you 're helping him . - I 'll take care of it . - Where did you come from ? - Never mind . He do n't need you guys . - How do you like that ? - He must follow Stryker like a little dog . What do you care ? At least he took him off our hands . A day after our leave , we drew a 22-mile hike over terrain carefully selected . All uphill , and it was a weary bunch of marines who pitched tents that night and gratefully folded themselves inside . Do you believe in love at first sight ? All kinds . I never did before but I sure do now .
zone1	- Because I 'm thinking about it now . - I 'm gon na marry that girl . - What girl ? - The girl I met last night . - You 'll feel better in the morning . I could n't feel any better than I do right now . I 've been thinking , why do men get married during a war ? - Do n't know . - It 's the worst time . I fooled around but I never thought about marriage . I know a lot of girls back in the States but ... I think it 's because when you get out here you 're close to things . You realise way down inside , no matter how much you try not to think about it , that maybe something 's got your number on ... and you want to leave a bit of yourself behind . Does n't matter if it 's a boy or a girl , just so long as you wo n't be forgotten . There 'll be someone who 'd never have lived if it had n't been for
zone1	right . - Hey , Conway , got a pass ? - I have . All right , hop in . I 'll give you a lift . - I hear you got a girl in town . - What if I have ? - They say she 's a very nice girl . - They talk too much . Are you serious about her ? With things the way they are , this is no time to start getting serious with a girl . Do n't know how long you 're gon na be here or when you 'll be back again . Do n't even know how long you 'll live . If it 's in the line of duty , you can tell me to do something and I 'll do it . As for my personal life , keep your hands off . - Your father would 've said it . - I would n't have listened . - You never did . - How do you know ? - He told me . - What did he say ? I 'll tell you . He
zone1	I would n't be able to stand up for myself , right ? - You 're doing the talking . - No , my father is . Every time you open your mouth , he 's talking . Every thought you think is his . It 's as though he 's at my shoulder . But he did n't always say or think the right thing . You 're gon na find that out when the time comes . Until then leave me alone . - You want a lift or not ? - Yeah , sure . - What 's the matter ? - Nothing . Why ? - You 've hardly said a word . - You 're right . I 've been thinking . - About us ? - Myself . That 's selfish . Honey , do you think I 'm a brave man ? - What a funny question to ask . - Well , do you ? I do n't know . Why ? - I 've got to prove something to someone . - Who ? You do n't know him . He
zone1	you 're brave . That helps . You do n't know how much that helps . Let 's not talk about it any more . We should have been talking about ourselves all this time , what 's going to happen to us . - What do you want to happen ? - I want to marry you . I want that , too . Funny , we barely know each other . We see each other for what seems only moments . And yet ... I know what you mean . - Choynski , not going to the wedding ? - No . I 'd better get a transfer . I ca n't learn this bayonet business . I 'm all thumbs . - On guard . - No , Sarge , not again ! - I 'm not well from the last time . - On guard ! - Play that thing again . You lead . - What ? You lead ! Shift your weight . Left , left ! There . Keep it up . You 'll get the knack of it . Practise that about
zone1	! I got it ! I have n't been in church since I was 14 . - Kissing the bride 's a great invention . - Sure makes me homesick . - What 's the matter ? - He looks the same . - How do you expect him to look ? - Married , wrinkled , worried , like me . - 44 hours and 34 minutes left . Go ! - Excuse me , sports . Here 's your wedding present from the gang . You 've all been wonderful . - Are you sure you 've got the right guy ? - I 'm sure . Come on , get going ! - " Sempre felice " , Mac ! - Keep the situation well in hand , Pete ! We got 44 hours and 33 minutes . What are we gon na do ? Al , if I was a girl , I 'd marry you . Knock it off ! I 've had a hard day . What am I doing ? 44 hours and 32 minutes . That is n't very long , is
zone1	wonder how many other people have had 44 hours and 32 minutes . Lots I guess . - We 'll make it seem a long time . - Years . - Shall I open it ? - Sure , go ahead . They 're in a hurry ! Others were in a hurry . The order said move out and the Marines moved out . 11 days at sea . Destination ? Only the top brass knew . Though , of course , scuttlebutt knew the answer , a hundred answers , all wrong . Boat Squad ... halt , one , two ! Dismissed ! Too bad you could n't see her again . You did n't get long . We knew it might happen . I 'll be back . I 've got to believe that . - Sure . We 'll all be back . - Gangway ! That 's no way to carry a flag , Regazzi . I 've got to teach you everything . Now watch this ... What are you gon na do with this , Benny ? I 'm gon na put
zone1	Times Square . - There is n't any Times Square in Tokyo . - There will be when I get there . Now that 's the way to fold a flag , with the blue field showing . What do you know ! - You got my shirt ! - It 's my shirt ! - I 'm telling you , it 's my shirt ! - It 's my shirt ! Here , fellas . You 'd better quit fighting so much . If you do n't , one of you 's apt to get hurt . Corpsman ! Corpsman ! - What 's that ? - Relax . It 's the Navy clearing its throat . Sure do n't sound like no squirrel gun . I hope they practise real good . What island do you think we 're aiming at ? We 'll get word . - Here it is . - It looks like a pork chop . - What 's its name ? - Tarawa . Never heard of it . It 's the wrong place . It 's part of an atoll called Tarawa
zone1	n't ask me how you spell it . You 'll have to stick your faces into it but you do n't have to spell it . - This is Red Beach Three . That 's us . - What have they got there ? Everything . This island 's held by a special naval landing force . That means Japanese marines . They 're dug in and they 're mean . They 'd just as soon die as stick a nickel in a jukebox , but that 's all right . Let the other guy die for his country . You 'll live for yours . - What 's the matter ? - Nothing . - Get over there . - I can hear him . Get over there . I do n't want anybody hurt because you did n't listen . - Schoolteacher , do me some homework . - What 's your problem , son ? Put down 5,000 . Scuttlebutt says that 's how many Nips are on that rock . - The Navy fired 1,000 tons of shells . - Do n't forget the fly-fly boys
zone1	Now add the tons of explosives , divide it by the Nips and get the answer . - Maybe we 'll be back for noon chow . - Do n't figure that way . The Navy and the fly-fly boys unloaded plenty on the canal before we went in . When we got ashore there were still a lot of those lemon-coloured guys waiting . Only way that island was taken was by putting marines on the beach . You 've heard the naval foray 's a waste of time and metal . Stryker knows better . - Who cut you in on this conversation ? - You say when I can and ca n't talk ? - Just when you ca n't talk to me . - Knock it off , Conway . I 've had enough of your " hardbitten sergeant " attitude . You 're so big everybody 's been afraid to take a punch at you . I 'm not ! Cool off ! Forget that pencil and paper routine and worry about staying alive on that beach . - Do n't expect any soft touch
zone1	report to your debarking stations ! All right , men , sound off when your name 's called . Now hear this , there 'll be no movies tonight ! The place is opened up for business . - Missed ! - Maybe they 're firing blanks . - Maybe a two-headed kid 's aiming . - Maybe this is just manoeuvres . Get out now . We 're crossing the line of departure . Lock and load ! - Good luck , Sarge ! - Charlie , give me a hand here ! Lieutenant , hit the deck ! How is it ? I got hit ! Corpsman ! You 'll be all right . They got us pinned down ! We ca n't get over these logs ! - I 'm going while I can ! - Stay here , kid ! We 're gon na be killed here . I 'd like to get at them ! Why rush ? This is a nice place . - They got the lieutenant ! - They 'll get all of us if we do n't move . We are
zone1	we train to take it lying down ? - Sarge , do something about it ! Stay where you are until I tell you . You got ta get us out of here ! If you 're nervous count your toes . I 'll do the masterminding around here . - Where 's Lieutenant Baker ? - Machine-gunned . - Is your squad all right ? - All but one . What 's holding us down ? That bunker , an old power plant . All these bombs and they 're still killing us . - Smoke , sir ? - Thanks . I 've sent for flame-throwers to assist . Your squad will support . Follow me ! You heard ! Move out and stay down ! We 've got ta silence that bunker ! Request naval gunfire be lifted on target areas , coordinates ... **28;4018;TOOLONG . Over . Roger and out . Flame-throwers out ! Demolition in ! Demolition out ! Shipley ! Give me a hand with this pack . Throw it ! Move out ! Get him out of there ! - There goes one
zone1	Better late than never . Come on ! Corpsman ! Corpsman ! This way ! Do n't wait . They 'll find me . Keep going . Hit ' em for me . Find Stryker . Stick with him . He 's good people . Tell him I ... I 'd like to know where the rest of the squad went . - What 's this place ? - Whatever it is it ai n't healthy ! Let 's go ! That was close . Next time do n't be in such a hurry . - You 're across , ai n't you ? - Across what ? To where ? - I 'm running low on ammo . - I am too . Forgot about that . We got ta get some more . - I 'll go . - Wait ! Pick a number from one to six . - Two . - Five . You 're both wrong . That guy kills me . Thomas better hurry ! - How about some bandoliers , Mac ? - Help yourself . - How are things going up front
zone1	- Good luck . - Is that coffee ? - It sure is . Do you want some ? Do I want some , he says ! I have n't had any joe since we left the ship . You mortarmen sure live the life of Riley here . Here you are . Beautiful ! - Where 's Thomas ? - Probably dead . No , not that guy . Let 's get out of here ! - Can I have some for my buddies ? - Sure . Break out your canteen . Tell me , how 's everything been going ? Could n't be better , Mac . Oh , this is the life ! Come and get it , you guys ! Ammo and fresh hot joe ! Hellenopolis ! Bass ! Hey , Greek ! Hey , Greek ! - What kepts you , Thomas ? - Where 's Bass ? Gutted . No ammo . What kept you , sports ? Major Crowe , sir . - Jim ? How you doing ? - " It 's tough going , Dave " . I 've
zone1	. Good . I 've been getting reports all day that the Nips are slipping in to your front . If it 's " banzai " tonight , target area 2-41 is a hot spot . What outfit have you got there ? Joyce and Stryker . Pass the word they got ta dig in and stay put . No noise or movement . Do n't risk anybody unless you have to . Hold on until we get more men there . Yes , sir . Major Crowe says the Nips have been filtering into these tank traps . Disperse your squad along this section . Tell your men there 's to be no smoking , no moving or unnecessary talking . If they find out how thin we are , they can get to the beach . That 's a platoon area . All I got 's a beat-up squad , short three men . - Could n't you ... ? - Can I give you three men ? The battalion ca n't give the whole company three replacements . Your squad is covering the hottest spot in the
zone1	strike you first . They want to know our disposition . I repeat , your men are not to move . - Aye , aye , sir . - Stryker , we 're going to hold this line . - Aye , aye , sir . - Good luck . All right , saddle up . Follow me . Everybody go ! Drop off at intervals , two-man foxholes . We 're gon na be spread out thin tonight . Do n't give away your position or strength . You Flynns stay here , and no quarrels . Dunne and Smith , drop out here . No gab tonight ! You and Harris here ! Come on , Conway . Corpsman ! Listen . - Corpsman ! - That 's a marine . Corpsman ! - Stryker ! - Get down and stay down ! - You had your orders ! - Somebody 's wounded ! - Quiet . - Let 's get him ! Stay down ! It may be an old Jap trick . They pulled it on the canal . - It does n't sound like a
zone1	You 'll tip our position . Stryker ! It 's Bass ! How many Japs know your name ? - You know his voice . - Shut up . Are n't you human at all ? A friend of yours may be dying ! Knock it off ! This is what my father taught you . Be a great marine , be tough . Sit here if you want . I 'm getting him . The only way you 'll stop me is to kill me . That 's just what I 'll do ! Stryker ! Stryker ! Sarge ! Stryker ! Please , Sarge ! Tarawa was officially declared secure at 13.30 on the fourth day of battle . The replacements came ashore , our wounded were cared for and the assault troops were relieved . - How am I doing , Chaplain ? - God has been good to you . You 're going home . Per istam Sanctam Unctionem , et suam piisimam , indulgeat tibi Dominus " quidquid deliquisti . Amen " . Somebody beat me to it . Skipper gave out some news .
zone1	bad . - They found Hellenopolis . He 's dead . - He was a good Greek . Choynski , Soames and Bass are on a hospital ship Stateside-bound . - I wish I was with them . - Let 's get cleaned up . Wash out those dungarees and let 's look like marines . You too , Thomas . - Dunne . - Yeah ? I got a couple of bottles of sake in my gear . Give it to the squad . - Right . - Tell them you got it off a dead Nip . Why do n't you break down a little ? You got it off a dead Nip . Aye , aye . - What 's eating you ? - Know what Stryker plans tomorrow ? Another squad problem and I 'm so tired of problems ! I 'm tired of Stryker ! I 'm also tired of beautiful Hawaii . Me , too . Hey , champ , what do you think of beautiful Hawaii ? - I do n't want to talk about it . - Clamming up again , ever
zone1	it off ! - Hi ! You got room for me ? - What do you know ! - You got time off for good behaviour ? - Yeah . - Where were you ? Pearl Harbor ? - Yeah , nice place . Pretty nurses . I 'll give somebody $5 to shoot me in the foot . - I 'll do it for $2.50 . - You 're too willing ! Some replacements out here assigned to our squad . We build up the joint and they come and live in it . This is Stein and Fowler and McHugh . He 's Fowler . Mike McHugh , from Cedar Rapids to see this war 's over in a hurry . - How old are you ? - Nineteen . - How old ? - Well , eighteen ... going on eighteen . We heard that the squad leader 's tough . - There are rumours to that effect . - Tough sergeants roll off my knife ! You 're gon na find your first few days with Sergeant Stryker very interesting . You new men come with
zone1	you ? - Certified fit for duty , so the medics say . - Good . The replacements came up with me . They get younger all the time . - Or we 're getting older . - Or both . - I can stand having you back . - I can stand being back . What happened to the squad , besides the Greek , Shipley and Thomas ? Choynski ... Thomas ? He never got a scratch . - I was sure he got it . - Why ? When we got stuck in a trench he went back to get ammo . Never came back . How long between the time he went back and you got overrun ? About 40 minutes . 40 minutes ? Stay here . Thomas ! - Yeah ? - Outside . - What 's that about ? - Do n't ask me . I have n't any spies . - That 's far enough . - What 's this about ? Just that I hate your guts ! Get up . You doped off and got one of my men killed
zone1	had enough . Get up ! - Stryker ... Attention ! All right , break it up . - What 's your name ? - Sergeant Stryker . Able Company , sir . And you ? Pfc Thomas . Able Company , sir . This may take some explaining before a court martial . Help that man up . - You 'll need medical attention . - I 'll be OK , sir . That 's debatable . You know it 's not permissible for an NCO to strike a man ? - Yes , sir . - Who struck the first blow ? Colonel , there was n't any first blow struck exactly . A simultaneous explosion perhaps ? Judo , sir . The sergeant was showing me how to break a judo hold . No more judo exhibitions . Understand , Sergeant ? Aye , aye , sir . At least you 're no stool pigeon . Wait a minute , Stryker . I 'm wrong , dead wrong . I know it . I doped off for some coffee , but I did n't think a few
zone1	that now , but I did n't then . It 's killing me . I ca n't sleep . A hundred times I wanted to tell you , tell somebody . I ... I liked that Greek ... I 'd do anything for him . If I could I 'd change him for me right now . I think you would . Guys make mistakes but every one we make , a stack of chips goes with it . We make a mistake and some guy do n't walk away ! For evermore he do n't walk away . I guess all we can do is just take it ... and hope we do n't make the same mistake again . I wo n't . Let 's get back . Mail call ! First Platoon . A letter from my wife after 18 months . Know where she is ? In England , entertaining troops . Entertaining troops ? Why is n't she here entertaining me ? I 'm a troop . " They 're all such nice boys . There 's a lieutenant here ... " A lieutenant !
zone1	a month ! I put on muscle lately ! Darling , this is a funny way for a man to find out he 's a father , but you are . It happened the day before yesterday , just in time for breakfast . He 's a boy and looks beautiful like me and intelligent like you . I should have told you it was going to happen , but I did n't want to worry you . I do n't know what to call him . We never discussed that . - I 'm a father ! Hey , I 'm a father ! - Let 's see ! - I 'm a father ! - All right , let 's fall in ! Come on ! Finally we got our leave . Ten days in Honolulu . All of us were out on the town . All except Stryker . He was still the same . - Lonesome ? - Drift . - Whiskey . - Two ? - Please . - OK . Thanks . A drink 'll be good . I 'm tired . It 's
zone1	'm sorry , Sergeant . - Right . - Thanks . 65 cents for a drink . It 's too much . They cheat servicemen . We could drink cheaper at my house . Do n't throw your arm out of joint . Thanks for the drink . I did n't mean to make too much buzzing in your ear . It 's all right , finish your drink . - I did n't mean to sound so tough . - I know . You 're just unhappy . Me , too . My name 's Mary . The long arm of coincidence , or something . Her name , too . That invitation still hold ? Make yourself comfortable . I 'll fix us a drink . Oh , dear ! Well , I can get us some more in a jiffy . I see . Will a sawbuck do it ? Go on , take it . It 's only paper . Well , I 'll be right back . - I hope this is your brand . - Any brand is mine . - She says she
zone1	the Marines . Mummy 's fixing you something . Her boy 'll be quiet while she has company . Knock it off ... Where 's his father ? Gone . Well , I guess into each life a little rain must fall . There are a lot tougher ways of making a living than going to war . You know about babies . Yeah , I know about babies . So long , Mac . - Wait ! - I ca n't spend it on a coral reef . - You 're a very good man . - You 'll get odds on that in the Marines . So long . So long , Sergeant . I 'll pray for you . Let 's not get religion . - I 'll pray for you , Sergeant ! - Good luck . You got a lot of bloodhound in you , Charlie , but you can call off the dogs . I 'm smarter than I was 30 minutes ago . Catch me feeling sorry for myself again and you got my permission to belt me in the nose ! -
zone1	boy ! - Thanks ! - Two bourbon and ice . - A baby 's a big event . - Conway ! - Treating the boys ? - Crack open the hatch ! That 's great . A fellow always gets more kick out of a boy , I guess . I got a kid . Sam , I named him ... after your old man . Wait till he gets to be ten and does n't write . You 'll be mad enough to hit him . No , I wo n't , Stryker , because he wo n't have to write . I 'll be where he is . And I wo n't insist that he be tough . I 'll try to make him intelligent . And I wo n't insist that he read the Marine Corps manual . I 'll get him Shakespeare . I do n't want him to be a Colonel Conway or Sergeant Stryker . I want him to be intelligent , considerate , cultured and a gentleman . - You 're out of line , kid . - Let him be .
zone1	and I intend to exercise that right . - I do n't like you , Stryker . - Let 's talk sense for a minute , Conway . I ca n't have friction in the squad . I 've tried every approach to you that I know . Got nowhere . You 're intelligent ... Do n't patronise me . Your opinion of my IQ does n't interest me in the least . Let 's get this straight . On duty I jump when you holler . Off duty I exercise my God-given rights under a democracy and dislike whom I please . Do we understand each other ? - Beat it . - Come on , you guys , let 's go . I do n't understand why you do n't belt him . - Mellow in my old age , I guess . - Too bad . " Screaming Sam " could n't be proud of him . He could . There 's something inside a guy , always proud of a kid . - Two more ? - Not for me . - I 'll sail again
zone1	steer me home ? - Charge ! Pull pins ! Prepare to throw ! Throw ! - All right , fifth relay ! - What an arm ! Pick it up ! Right in the groove ! - Look , boy , this is a live grenade . - Gee ! - You know what they can do ? - Yes , sir . Right hand . Wait for the order to pull pin and pitch grenade . - Got it ? - Yes , sir . Ready ? Pull pin ! Prepare to throw ! Throw ! Grenade ! Hit the deck ! When will you wake up ? You wan na see her again , keep your mind on your work ! - What happened here ? - Little accident , sir . You 're wounded . Corpsman ! - Yes , sir . - Take care of the sergeant . Come right over here , Sergeant . You may not know it , but you just got your life saved . You 'll get a medal . Again the word came and the Marines moved out .
zone1	This time we were a sound fighting unit , blooded and trained . Tarawa had blooded us . Stryker had trained us . - Now , I 'll show you something . - What you got there ? - What does it look like ? - A flag . - What are you gon na do with it ? - Occupy this island in the USA 's name . - You think we 'll have an easy time ? - You got me with you . - Maybe we need two of you . - One was enough in Tarawa . Stick with me . I 'm a battle-hardened veteran . Know how many Japs I knocked off in Tarawa ? 32 . Did I get anything for it ? I got enemies in Washington . If the Marines did n't have me , they 'd never have made it . Now , this is how you fold a flag ! Do you believe in intuition ? Yeah ... in women . Why ? It 's hard to explain . I 've a feeling I 'm not coming out of
zone1	I ca n't help it . It 's the way I feel . - Why ? I do n't know . It 's like a voice in my ear . I ca n't shake the feeling off . Take my advice , shake it off . No dice . When things like that get in you , it 's no use trying to fight them . If a marine waits long enough he gets the word . Our sealed orders came aboard after five days at sea . This island is volcanic and sandy . It 's five and a half miles long and two and a half miles wide . This mountain here is a dead volcano . It 's called Suribachi . There 's nothing on the island except three airfields and about 20,000 Japs . The Army Air Corps B-24s have been bombing this place for 62 days . - Maybe it 'll be an easy operation then . - We ca n't be sure . Every yard is covered by some kind of fire . There are two possible landing beaches , one on the east
zone1	the coastline is cliffs . They 'll try and keep us off the beaches . If they do n't , they 'll try and catch us at this first airfield , between the heights of Suribachi and these high rocky ridges in the north . They 'll shell us from both sides . Nobody knows what they 've got on this island . But they 've had 40 years to put it there . Saipan was our last stop . The men who were going to hit the beach first transferred to LS Ts . A few more days at sea and the time for landing came . Saddle up ! Skip along and into the amtracs . Anyway , it 's a good day for it . - It 's cold . - Stick around , it 'll get warm . Yeah , that 's what I 'm afraid of . Hey , look ! - Driver , you the joker that wrote that ? - " Semper fi " , Mac ! We should take you in along with us . Hey , McHugh 's going in with
zone1	got ! So ? The kid 's a reader . That should n't worry a dope like you . When we 're through with this operation , I 'm gon na break both your legs ! - I feel sick . - I know . I felt the same way at Tarawa . Hey , Stein , " Shalom aleychem " . Aleychem shalom . - Sarge , I 'm scared . - So am I . - Not you ! - Fowler , I 'm always scared . Line of departure ! Get down ! Lock and load ! Drop those lifebelts when we hit the beach ! All right , hit the beach ! It ai n't Brooklyn ! If this place was a blanket I 'd pull it over my head ! This is the poorest soil I ever saw . What does anyone want an island like this for ? - That 's war . - What 's war ? Trading real estate for men . When God made the world , he must have put all the rubbish left over here . Corpsman ! Corpsman
zone1	same place they got me before ! Getting shot for this ! They 're sure pouring it into Suribachi . Not enough . Those Nips are shooting right down our throats . - Stryker ! - Yo ! - Lieutenant Shrier wants to see you . - Lieutenant Shrier ? Stand fast . - Stryker reporting , sir . - I know . Your platoon 's been hit hard . What 's left has been assigned to me . - Yes , sir . - Naval gunfire lifts at 1100 . Stand by . Aye , aye . Move out ! Keep your distance ! - Go on , go on ! - Corpsman ! Corpsman ! Corpsman ! Spread out ! Dig in ! - Dunne , where 's my brother ? - Back there . He 's hit . Flynn ! That 's enough ! I told you you 'd need this bad some day . Thanks , Marine . Flynn ! Get down ! - You ai n't got the sense of a rabbit ! - You can still be a hero crawling ! - Corpsman !
zone1	get him back ! Harris ! Well , I 'll get a good night 's sleep tonight . Corpsman ! He wo n't need him . - Pillbox too big to handle with these . - A bazooka ? - If we had one . - I got nothing to do . I 'll go pick one up . Regazzi did n't make it . You never know what 's happening . Listen . - It 's a tank . - Yeah , but whose ? Ours ! It 's Regazzi . Pillbox at 2 o'clock . OK , give ' em a hot foot ! Thanks , Mac . - I could n't find a bazooka . - You did all right . Saddle up ! No one had ever seen anything like it . No one would have believed it possible . That smoking , miserable , bloody island . After three days and three nights , and at the end of that time , we 'd barely reached the foot of Suribachi , where we were the first day . - We 'll sack here for the
zone1	one man awake at all times . Keep alert . Let 's go . It 'll start getting rough tomorrow against Suribachi . It started getting rough when you put on that uniform . You wan na see a good-looking kid ? Husky little boot . What 's his name ? We 're gon na name him Sam , Sam Conway . A name that 's been awarded the Navy Cross is good enough for any kid . There 's something I 've been trying to say but ... I ca n't find the words . Two universities and you ca n't find the words to say you were out of line ? - OK , I 'm out of line . - No , you were . There 's a difference . We 'd better get some sack time . Wan na sleep first or watch ? - I 'll watch . - OK . Everybody gets out of line once in a while . Thanks , gyrene . Where 's Sergeant Stryker ? - Stryker ? - Right there . - What do you want ? - Lieutenant
zone1	. - Yes , sir . I 'm taking a patrol up Suribachi . Get your men squared away and be ready at 0700 . - The rendezvous is that Nip tank there . - Aye , aye , sir , 0700 . That little voice whispering in your ear again ? Do n't worry . I 've known a million guys that have heard it . Most of them make it . A few do n't . The percentage is on your side . - Did you ever hear it ? - No . - Do n't you ever worry about it ? - What good would it do ? - You 're indestructible . - Stick close . It might rub off ! I 'll do that . Banner Three , this is Easy Five . Patrol is ready to move . Request supporting fire . Ow ! Sh'ma Yisrael , Adonai elohenu ... Adonai echad . Amen . Radio ! Banner Three , this is Easy Five . Over . This is Easy Five . Cease fire , we 're preparing to move over the top .
zone1	sir . Colonel 's ordered that we put up this flag when the top 's secure . Get it there . Aye , aye , sir . What is this ? Put yours away . This is the one we 're gon na use . First squad . Find something we can use as a standard and we 'll put this up . - Conway , you made it . - I guess that little voice was wrong . - I feel better . - I feel better , too . I never felt so good in my life . How about a cigarette ? - Is he ... ? - Yeah . If he had to get it it 's the way he 'd have wanted . It 's a letter to his kid . " Dear son , I guess none of my letters have reached you . " " I thought I 'd try again as I 'm feeling " " that this may be the last time I can write you . " " For a long time I 've wanted to tell you many things
zone1	, I will . " " If we 'd been together even for a while , " " I could 've explained many things much better than writing them . " " You 've got ta take care of your mother , and love her and make her happy . " " Never hurt her or anyone as I did . " " Always do what your heart tells you is right . " " Maybe someone will write you some day and tell you about me . " " I want you to be like me in some things , but not like me in others . " " When you grow older and get to know more about me , you 'll see I 've failed ... " " ... in many ways . " " This is n't what I wanted but things just turned out that way . " " If there was only more time I ... " Guess he never finished it . I 'll finish it for him . There she goes . All right , saddle up ! Let 's get back
zone1	4671350 Conductor did n't want to play . How 's this guy ? Nice and willing . Stop the train and let us off . When we tell you . Ed , Cotton , when we get the train on the spur , start hopping . Go . Zuckie , you know what to do ? Sure . I throw the switch , and then I beat it back ... All right , just do it . Stop the gabbing . All right . This is where we want off . Stop it right here . Get away from those controls . What 's this ? A holdup ? No . You 're seven minutes late . We 're just changing engineers . A lot fancier than my old coal burner on the C and O . Shut up . Open up and you wo n't get hurt . Sounds bad , Cody . Why do n't you give my address , too ? Only the treasury stuff ! Hurry up . You wo n't get away with it , Cody . Cody , huh ? Go get the car started . You 've got a good memory for names
zone1	, let 's get out of here . A week has passed since bandits jumped a mail train ... coming out of the High Sierra Tunnel ... and fled with $300,000 in federal currency , leaving four dead . Treasury authorities now believe the gang has escaped to Arizona ... where today a bank was raided and two tellers killed ... with the same cold-bloodedness that characterized ... Now we 're supposed to be in Arizona . Any place would be better than this . We got to blow out of here . Cody calls charging roadblocks unscientific . It ai n't safe having a crackpot giving orders . - It 's about time somebody took over . - Who ? A very good friend of mine : Me . Where do you want the body sent ? Been golfing , Ed ? We got a sack full of dough and we 're holed up like a bunch of gophers . When we moving out ? Maybe tomorrow . Maybe in the spring . I 'll give it a lot of thought . All right ? It smells good ,
zone1	do with some help , son . Verna . Help Ma with the groceries . Well , if it ai n't the sleeping beauty . What else does a girl do around this bear trap ? There 's plenty you can do without wearing out the mattress . It 's the only place I do n't freeze . I 've been cold for a week . Not even a fire . Who 's gon na see a little bit of smoke 100 miles from nowhere ? Help Ma with the grub . He 's getting worse . He needs a doc . When the time comes . - Want some coffee , Ed ? - Thanks , Verna . Let him get it himself . My wife do n't wait on nobody . You know something , Verna ... if I turn my back long enough for Big Ed to put a hole in it ... there 'd be a hole in it . Big Ed . Great Big Ed . You know why they call him that ? Because his ideas are big . Someday he 's gon na
zone1	be his last . That 's the second one he 's had in a month . He 's nuts , just like his old man . It 's these mountains , Cody . It 's not good for you , cold all the time . Ca n't breathe the air . Let 's get out , son . It 's going . - It 's going ? - Yeah . - Are you sure ? - Yeah . It 's like having a red-hot buzz saw inside my head . No , not yet , son . Do n't let them see you like that . Might give some of them ideas . Always thinking about your Cody , are n't you ? That 's right . Top of the world , son . Do n't know what I 'd do without you , Ma . - Better ? - Yeah . Now go on out . Show them you 're all right . What are you all gaping at ? And I thought I told you to help Ma with the groceries . Cody , there 's a storm
zone1	the guy said . - What guy ? - On the radio . - How long did he give it ? - Tonight . That 's just what I 've been waiting for . Is everything packed ? We been packed for a week . You sure it 's safe , Cody ? A storm keeps everybody busy . Clean up this place , and clean it up right . And do n't leave any calling cards . I told you to keep away from that radio . If that battery is dead , it 'll have company . It 's your suitcase , Cody . Why do n't you keep it all ? You 're cute . Come here . Why do n't you ? We could travel , buy things . That 's what money 's for . I look good in a mink coat , honey . You 'd look good in a shower curtain . We 're pals , Cotton . You 'll see that I get away all right , see that I get to a doc ? Sure , Zuckie . We 're all
zone1	on the train , huh ? - Pretty good for my first job , huh ? - Yeah , you were great . You wo n't leave me here . You 'll take me with you . We ca n't take chances of being picked up with you in the car . We 'll send a doc back right away . You 're gon na let me die . Cotton , do n't leave me . Suppose they find him ? You know how Zuckie talks . He wo n't talk . Cotton . You meant what you said about sending a doc ? Yeah , sure . A specialist . You . Here . If you 're such a pal of his . Go back and make it easy for him . Rest easy , Ma . We 're 300 miles from the tunnel . What have they got ? A corpse without a record . Nothing to tie him in with the tunnel job or us . Do n't make a sound . It 's me , Cotton . Look , I 'll try to come back .
zone1	, we 'll separate . Go east until you hit the highway , and double back over the bridge . Stay on dirt roads all the way . You hear ? TAHOE COUNTY MORGUE Hope I did n't get you up here on a wild goose chase , Mr . Evans . Geese we 're looking for are pretty wild . A couple of hunters found him frozen up in the mountains . We started wondering : Stranger , bullet hole in the roof of the cabin ... particularly the condition of his face . Tell him , Doc . Despite the third-degree burn ... the eyebrows and hairline were n't even singed . That means either boiling water or steam . So , we thought of a steam engine . Good hunch . Get me his clothes . Ernie , get his fingerprints . Take a mask of his face . Here you are , Mr . Evans . Nothing in the pockets but this pack of cigarettes . U.S.TREASURY DEPARTMENT So like you told me , Mr . Evans , I made the rounds for a month .
zone1	know , just dropping a word in the right ear ... that I 'm interested in picking up a few odd dollars . Not a buck from the tunnel job showed up . They have n't buried it in tin cans , Willie . Keep looking . Okay . I 'll go out the back way , if you do n't mind . Any of the boys spotted me coming up here , I 'd be in a real jam . - Did you get anything out of Willie ? - A blank . This will cheer you up , Phil . Spectrograph of dirt from the tunnel . Spectrograph of dust deposits taken from the dead man 's clothes . There 's no doubt about it . They 're identical . It all adds up ... and places our friend in the morgue right smack at the scene of the crime . Looks like we 're in business . From Washington . " Have no fingerprint record dead man . " That 's one I never expected . Dead man , dead end . " But prints on cellophane
zone1	Valenti ... " known member , Jarrett gang . " And I thought you were never gon na talk , baby . - Where 's Ma ? - She went to the market . - Which one ? - She do n't tell me those details . What difference does it make ? I 'll tell you what difference it makes . They 've got Zuckie in a morgue upstate . The T-men tied him in with us on the tunnel job . - What ? - Yeah . We 're all as hot as pistols . I do n't know how they did it . Somebody must have tipped them . It 's always " somebody tipped them , " never " the cops are smart . " We had enough food for the week . Why did she go out ? You like strawberries , do n't you ? Well , she just had to get some for her boy . Evans speaking . Her car is parked outside pointing west . Good . I 'll be down there right away . There 'll be a marker on
zone1	Mr . Evans . Where Ma goes , Cody goes . We 'll use the A-B-C method . I 'm B . I 'll keep first position behind suspect on Arango Blvd . 227 , you 're A . You drive parallel on Lattimer . Okay . 323 , you 're C . The same on Fairchild . - Got that ? - Okay . Suspect proceeding dead ahead on Arango Blvd . Approaching Bakeman . Suspect turned north on Bakeman . C , pick her up at Fairchild . A will take your position . Got her . Traveling dead ahead on Bakeman , 20 miles an hour . Suspect turning west on Calhoun . C , proceed dead ahead . Take position on the right . Right . A , pick her up on Calhoun . Roger . Got her . Going due west about 30 miles per hour . Hold the phone . She 's turning left on Cling . Let her go . C , cut over fast to Arango . - Cover her on the left . - Okay . A , proceed dead ahead
zone1	. Get around it . A , C , cut into Fairchild . I 've lost her . Down there . - Come in , C . - That 's a dead spot . It would be . Turn around . We 'll go back . Hold it . Come in , A . Come in , C . - Beat it up the hill and call the others . - You 're not tackling him alone . I 'll just keep an eye on him . Hurry . What 's the use of having money if you got ta run ... every time somebody sees a shadow ? It 's just a feeling I had . I could have been wrong . Your hunches are never wrong , Ma . We 'll leave the sedan , the car they 're looking for . You bring the bags and I 'll get the coupe . You 're not going anywhere , Jarrett . Put your hands up where I can see them . Get those bags in , and get in fast ! Down the highway , Ernie . Happens
zone1	. Kill that . This is great . Where do we go after the second feature ? You 're staying put . I 'm the only one going anyplace . - Where , Cody ? - Gon na give myself up . What are you talking about ? You have n't a chance . Four dead . It 's the gas chamber for sure . You think I 'm dumb enough to give myself up to the T-men ? What 's the difference ? You walk into the cops and they turn you over . Remember a guy named Scratch Morton ? Yeah . The guy on the lam from Illinois . You had a talk with him one night . - That 's the one . - I remember . Knocked over a hotel payroll in Springfield ? The night we pulled the tunnel job . Handy ? Talk plain , son . I pulled that Springfield heist , not Scratch Morton . I 'm going to Illinois and take a state rap . I 'll get two years at the most . They 'll still be waiting for
zone1	While those hoodlums were killing innocent people on the train ... I was pushing in a hotel in Springfield . Could n't be in both places at once , could I ? Little thing I cooked up before the tunnel job . You 're the smartest there is . Sure , it 's smart , but what about me ? What do I do for the next two years ? The same as you did before he married you . You better not , baby . I 'll be back . I 'll be waiting for you , honey . You can trust me . If the T-men pick you up , you do n't know a thing . You have n't seen me in months . Ma , you do all the talking . - I can handle them . - Verna , you cry a little , like you 're sad . How are you going to make it to Illinois ? Private plane . Do n't worry . Goodbye . Be kind of a break to get rid of me for a while , wo n't it
zone1	you , I was just trying to cheer up Verna . She 's been lonesome all this time , missing Cody so much . So I went to the market to buy her things for a real spread . Thought it 'd make her feel better . That so , Verna ? Yet as soon as you returned to the auto court , you left again . Why ? ' Cause we decided to go to a movie instead . - What theater ? - San Val Drive In . - What picture ? - Task Force . Exciting . Verna liked it a lot . - Cody like it ? - How could he ? I told you . Cody has n't been in California for months . I suppose he shot me all the way from another state . What makes you think he shot you ? Lots of people have guns . I was as close to him as I am to you . Anybody else see him ? Just you . And his wife . Of course , being an old woman , I would n't
zone1	got to have witnesses to make anything stand up in court . You see Cody last night , Verna ? Makes you the only one , Mr . Evans , does n't it ? Seems to . If Cody 's been out of California for months ... I suppose he could n't have engineered that train robbery six weeks ago . I 'm not going to sit here and hear you accuse my boy without proof . Besides , I know my rights . You ca n't keep us here . You got nothing on us . All right , Mrs . Jarrett , that 'll be all now . That 's better . Come on , Verna . Stop crying . Nobody 's going to hurt you . Mr . Fallon just arrived from the airport . Send him right in . Hello , Phil . How 's the arm ? I 'll live . Hey , you 're looking good . It 's that prison diet . Great chef in San Quentin . I hated to leave . You did a whale of a job . Most talkative
zone1	syndicate comes up for trial in a few weeks . Now , what 's that ? You put it on a pole , wind a spool of silk thread around it ... and you hold the pole over the water . Then you sit under a nice , shady tree and relax . After a while , a hungry fish comes along , nips at your hook , and you 've got dinner . For the next two weeks , I wo n't think about anything ... except the eternal struggle between man and the fish . I 've been promised a vacation . You remember ? Sorry , Hank , that 's out . Phil , look at me . College degree , lovable personality ... and I spend most of my time in prison . An undercover specialist . Eight sentences in five years . Dannemora , Sing Sing , Leavenworth ... I joined the department to put criminals behind bars ... and here I am , stir crazy . Read this . Who checks confessions in Springfield ? Every rookie knows Scratch Morton went underground after that
zone1	with a two-bit prison stretch ? - Maybe ? - Maybe ? A hoodlum turns himself in on a phony rap ... and beats the gas chamber . I 'll bet you he 's thumbing his nose at Uncle Sam now and loving it . Jarrett outsmarted you . That 's just what we want him to think . We 're working with the Springfield police . We arranged for the confession to check . So , what happens ? Jarrett does a stretch in the penitentiary . In case he 's lonely , wants to talk to someone ... we 'll let one of our boys do a stretch right in the same cell . Still going fishing , Hank ? Yeah . In what prison ? You 'll enjoy the food there . Wonderful chef . - Arrested him myself . - Okay , what 's the pitch ? You 'll be committed to the penitentiary in Illinois . You 'll be one of Jarrett 's cellmates . Stick with him until you find out ... where he unloaded $300,000 in federal currency ... without a single bill
zone1	of the very special fence ... that engineered this deal . How does he operate ? Buys stolen money here , 30c , 40c on the dollar . Peddles it on the European black market for who knows how much . No questions asked . Sweet racket . In step with the times . That 's your assignment . I would n't ask you to do another undercover job ... if we were n't up against it . Hello , Hank . Prison records from Illinois . Your new buddies . Busy little place , is n't it ? 2,700 of the roughest and toughest . A few who might recognize you . Let 's go to work . - Find another old client ? - Yeah . Red Draper . Questioned him in ' 46 about a warehouse job . That makes two for transfer . Better run through the arrest once more . I 'll be picked up at a joint known as Tom 's Hideaway . Bill 's Hideaway . On what seems like an ordinary hood roundup . I 'm spotted as a lamister . I
zone1	off the floor , I 'm meek as a baby . - How do I get information out to you ? - Visiting days . Mother again ? Wife this time . One thing though . This time , get me somebody with a good memory . I had a lot of trouble with my " mother " in San Quentin . This time , we 'll get you a girl in the bureau who 's a memory expert . I 'm partial to blondes . Well , who is n't ? As soon as I pick her , I 'll send you a picture . - We move this guy . - Who is he ? Bo Creel . Arrested him two years ago . Wait a minute . We do n't have to worry about him . Finishes his stretch Saturday . He 'll be out before you 're sentenced . Good . Bo Creel would know me in the dark . This job is n't going to be like any of the others , Hank . You see , there 's insanity in the Jarretts . Some
zone1	in an institution . I 've had a few strange cellmates in my time ... but this sounds like the jackpot . When he was a kid , he used to fake headaches ... to get his mother 's attention away from the rest of the family . It worked . As he grew up , the fancied headaches became real ... until now they tear him to pieces . Any minute , he 's apt to crack open at the seams . There goes our case . So you 'll be working against time . Suits me . Quicker the better . Except that Cody 's not easy to get close to in a hurry . The only person he 's ever cared about or trusted is his mother . No one else has ever made a dent , not even his wife . His mother 's been the prop that 's held him up . He 's got a fierce psychopathic devotion for her . All his life , whenever he got in a spot ... he just put out his hand , and there was Ma Jarrett
zone1	his old man . You mean I 'm supposed to take mama 's place ? Never can tell . He might need someone . I 'll practice up on my lullabies . Nothing else here . Good . Let 's run through your background again . Born Detroit , March 23 , 1919 . State reform school , 1934 , vandalism . Arrested : Suspicion , grand larceny , Portland , 1939 . Good . The State of Illinois v . Arthur Cody Jarrett . Arthur Cody Jarrett , on your own admission ... you have been convicted of the robbery of the Palace Hotel on October 12 . It is now my duty to pronounce sentence . For the crime of grand larceny , you are hereby sentenced to serve ... not less than one and not more than three years ... in the state penitentiary . The State of Illinois v . Victor Pardo . How is he ? Tough ? With Big Ed giving the orders now , there 'll be all kinds of fireworks . He 's got plans that 'll make the old Jarrett mob
zone1	. Parker moves his lips pretty good . It 's about Big Ed . What 'd he say ? He 's the number one boy now , Parker says . In more ways than one . - What was that crack ? - I could n't read him , Cody . - Was that about my wife ? - Honest , he had his mouth covered . Maybe a kick in his skull would do him some good . They got rules in this chicken coop . You start anything , you 'll wind up in a hole . Did I ask you for any advice ? Look , Pardo , I 've been watching you ... and up till now , you have n't done anything I can put my finger on . Maybe that 's what bothers me . I do n't know you , and what I do n't know , I do n't trust . To me , you 're a face and a number , and let 's keep it that way . When I want your help , I 'll ask for it .
zone1	. The following new men report to the dispensary for shots . Abbott , Jordan , Bacon , Pardo , Butler ... Jenkins , Jarrett , Williams , Phillips . Hughes , Russell . Keep it moving , boys . No talking . Well , if it ai n't Bo Creel . Boys in L.A . Had a coming-out party . It was planned for you a month ago . I 'm packing , and bang , flat on my back with pneumonia . The doc 's checking me out today . See you in eight years . Hyde , Frank . - Keep moving , boys . No talking . - Jacoby , George . All right , move up . Jarrett , Arthur Cody . I 'm leaving tomorrow , Cody . - Anything I can do for you on the coast ? - Yeah , look up Big Ed . - Tell him I was asking for him . - Johnson , Bate . Holden , John . Get the lead out . Coon , Fred . Scared , sonny ? Break it up over there .
zone1	. He 's nuts . A couple months in solitary will cool you off , bugger . Fisher . Maddox . Pardo . I 'm awfully sorry , my good man . But Mr . Pardo is still on vacation . His month 's up today . It is , huh ? That 's cozy . Look at what they left out of this one . It must have been a lulu before the warden got it . - Hey , Herbert . - Yeah . Any chance you get , read Pardo , will you ? - Why ? - Read him . Maybe on visiting days . That 's when they loosen up . What do you have against him , Cody ? Pardo 's all right . Did n't I check his record up at the dispensary ? That 's only a record . What else do we know about him ? Maybe that envelope will tell us something . Think you ought to ? That 's U.S . Mail . I 'm a U.S . Citizen , ai n't I ? Not lately . Wife .
zone1	, you do n't get a chance to . Nice . We 'll put it right over here where we can see it . He 'll know we 've been in his mail . All right . So he 'll know . Be a nice surprise when he gets out of solitary . Hi , kid . Let me shake the hand that slugged Roy Parker . Why did you do it , Pardo ? You know they got rules in this joint , do n't you ? Yeah . Maybe I did n't want to get my shots . I guess his eyes ai n't so good after solitary . All right , what 's the gag ? What 's she done to herself ? Had the best-looking blonde I ever saw . When my back 's turned , she 's a brunette . Do n't even look like her anymore . Maybe she 's hot . Whenever I changed my hair , so did my missis . She better be a blonde when I get out of here . Yeah . Too bad your little trick did n't
zone1	your shots anyway . Yeah , Benny . Parker 's shooting his mouth off again . Told Benny your boys pulled a caper . - How much did they get ? - $57,000 . - Are you in for any of it ? - Full share . No kidding ? What 's being in here got to do with it ? They 're his boys . What they get , he gets . Yeah . Ma sees to that . Get one thing clear , all of you . Anything we get ... Cody 's in for his full share . That 's how it is . Anyone thinks different ... say so now ... or would you rather wait till Cody gets out ? Well , any argument ? Het ? Cotton ? Happy ? Ed ? How come , Big Ed ? You 're the one I expected to give trouble . Fair is fair . We are n't gon na forget Cody after all he did for us . Cody 'll be real grateful to you . Where do you think you 're going ? To pick
zone1	It 's getting late . Het , tell Verna I want her back in here . - What 's eating you , sugar ? - You and your big ideas . That 's all they are . Ideas . " You and me belong together , sugar . Just leave it to Big Ed . " I 'm sick of waiting for you to make your move . You 're as scared of Cody as any of them . He 's still Mr . Big , in prison or out . - What makes you think so ? - You . Fair is fair , is it ? That 's quite a beef you put up about Cody being in on the cut . See , a guy who thinks his pals are taking care of him ... he gets kind of careless . What does that mean ? Alive , Cody gets out in one , two years , maybe . Dead , he gets out sooner . Dead ? Right now , he 's a sitting duck up there in that pen . He 's rubbing elbows with
zone1	Ed ? When I say so . Where 's Pardo ? You know all about radios . Maybe you can fix the warden's . - I 'll fix it so it blows up in his face . - Suits me . Come on . Back to your places . Go ahead . Get on back there . Are you hurt , Jarrett ? No . Things were getting kind of dull around here , anyway . Back to your work . You , too , Pardo . - The lever slipped . - You can tell that to the warden later . I saw that just in time . What do you want ? A medal ? You would have looked like that barrel . You almost walked into it yourself . Why should you care if a guy named Cody Jarrett gets his ... if you do n't want something ? Okay . Keep your medal . Come on , break it up . Get going , Jarrett . Sorry , Cody . Forget it , Parker . Accidents will happen . Attention . The following men have visitors
zone1	, Phillips , Jordan . Hello , Ma . Cody . You been hurt . - Oh , it 's nothing . Just an accident . - You sure ? What kind of question is that ? Why are you nervous ? Anything wrong ? - Plenty . - Like what ? That 's why I come . I 'm the one to tell you . It 's Big Ed and Verna . They run out . It 's my fault , Cody . I let you down . I said I 'd take care of things and I let you down . I saw it coming , but I did n't think he 'd have the guts . Forget it , Ma . It was in the cards for Big Ed to make his try . Do n't you care ? Sure . What 's mine is mine , but I ai n't gon na let it make me sick . I 'll take care of them when I get out . That 's what I told myself . I 'll help you , Cody , like always .
zone1	the world . When you 're around , Ma , nothing can stop me . That 's right . Only you got to be careful about Big Ed . If I know Big Ed , right now he 's doing enough worrying for the both of us . Maybe not . Ca n't expect me to come looking for him . That 's what I 'm getting at . When you get out ... he knows his life is n't worth a plugged nickel . When a tinhorn like that thinks he 's big enough to take your place ... he 's got to feel pretty safe . Now , all of a sudden , he makes his move ... like he was sure you 'd never get out of here ... except in a box . I see what you mean . You said it was an accident ? For a minute , I thought it was . How 'd it happen ? A pal of Big Ed 's dropped something . You see , Cody ? I was right . He was figuring you 'd be dead .
zone1	n't I ? If he tried it once , he 'll try it again . I 'll still walk out of this joint , and then I 'll take care of Big Ed . And let him live that long ? No , Cody . I 'll take care of Big Ed . No , Ma . You wo n't have a chance . Any time I ca n't handle his kind , I 'll know I 'm getting old . No one does what he 's done to you , son , and gets away with it . No , Ma . Look , listen to me . You wo n't have a chance . I 'm going after him to keep him from having you knocked off here . - I 'm telling you , do n't do it . - Goodbye , Cody . Ma ! Keep your hands off that wire . What 's the matter , Parker ? I ai n't going to do anything . Not now . I 'm going to let you stay awake nights ... sweat it out . Then when
zone1	pay you back . I 'll take care of Big Ed . I 'll take care of him , Cody . What 's the matter , Cody ? My head . Cover for me . Watch it . Fingers are kind of thick today . No doctors . It 's all right now . He 's gone . - Where 's the pain ? - It 's right here . Do n't let it beat you . You are a top man , are n't you ? Since I was a kid , I 've been reading about you . Always hoping I could join up with you . You do n't want to let those two-bit mugs see Cody Jarrett on his knees . Come on . - You all right , Cody ? - Yeah . - Just ca n't sleep , that 's all . - That headache gone ? - Yeah . - Then why ca n't you sleep ? It 's Ma . She 's walking into trouble . - Anything I can do ? - No . Yeah . Maybe there is , kid
zone1	out this penny-ante stretch ... would be a kind of vacation ... take the heat off me for another job . Sometimes you make plans , sometimes they do n't work out . Then you got to get doing and fast , you understand ? - I got business on the outside . - Going to crash out ? Yeah . Want to come along ? Maybe I do . Did you tell anybody else ? Figured on cutting in Tommy Ryley . Then you 'll have to cut in 10 more . Why do you want Ryley ? He 's got a gun stashed . Do n't need a gun . They 're not gon na open the gates for us . You think you 're the only guy in this paw that wants out ? What do you think I 've been dreaming about nights ? I got a way to get a mile from here before anybody knows what hit them . Without artillery , it ca n't be done . No ? Listen , I 'm a pretty handy fella with electricity , you remember ?
zone1	. You know what that means ? I have a slight idea . The generators control everything : Searchlights , gun turret , main gate . Who needs artillery ? Only we got to do it alone . We 're going to need a car . My wife 's coming tomorrow . We 'll set it all up . All right , kid . It 's a deal ... and if it works , I 'll pay you back . Maybe you 'll give me that medal . Solid gold . Good news for you , Herbert . You 've had good news for the last 12 years . I 'm working on a plan to get your case reviewed . - Hello , Margaret . - You 're looking well , Vic . We 're being watched . Say anything you like and make it good . Listen to me carefully . Divorce ? Vic , you ca n't mean that . Why ? What have I done ? That 's fine . Jarrett 's getting out of here and I 'm going with him . I know how
zone1	anything that 'll break my heart . It might be better for you . It 's my life . Let me decide what to do with it . Just the two of us . Tell Evans we 'll break out Thursday night . Tell him to plant a getaway car with an oscillator . Can you remember that ? With an oscillator . I 'll remember , darling . - Everything clear ? - Perfectly clear . You wo n't be sorry , Vic . When you get out , we 'll be happy . I 'll see to that . Nice . Where 'd you learn all that ? Soap opera ? How did you know ? This time I 'm going right to the top to get you out . - Herbert , are you listening ? - Sure , Jerry . But if that fails , you 'll have to serve the rest of your term . Jerry , you could n't get me out of here if I was pardoned . All right , this is the prison . We place the getaway car in these
zone1	hooked up to the battery . Our cars will be parked here , a mile or so away , one here and the other here . We assume that Jarrett and Hank come out here somewhere . They pile into the getaway car , and they 're off . - You ready , Ernie ? - Ready . The transmitter wavelength is 47.1 . 47.1 . All right . Switch it on . Our receivers pick up that sound from the oscillator ... which enables us to cross-plot their exact position . For example ... suppose the impulse received here ... has a bearing of 210 degrees . This one here reads 45 degrees . We plot them like so . Where the lines cross , that 's where they are . It does n't matter how far they travel . As long as our cars are within receiving distance ... we can tell where they are . Switch it off . How far is receiving distance ? We had a dry run on a car yesterday . Kept tabs on him for 20 miles . That little thing ?
zone1	I 'll show you how . When you 've got a week to spare , Ernie 'll tell you all about electronics . We 'll meet at the airport in 40 minutes . Be in Springfield late this afternoon . Tonight . Is n't that Lefeld down there ? Nat Lefeld ? From the coast mob . Came in today . They checked him in today ? Ask him how my mother is . Ask about Cody 's mother . She 's dead . Dead ? I want to get out of here ! Get me out ! Special for Jarrett . - Hiya , Doc . - Hi , Ryley . Hi , Cody . Brought you some grub . Hot soup made special . How are you , Vic ? Glad to see you , kid . You 're a good boy , Vic . It 's me , Tommy Ryley . That 's right , Vic . Play it smart . Play it smart . That 's the only way it 'll work . Here , get some of this into you . Next time you come
zone1	go about it , Vic . Bring the gun . You sure you wo n't try some of this delicious soup ? I 'll get it if you take me along , Cody . I do n't want any of that slop . Try it on the warden . It 's a deal . If you do n't want it , I guess you do n't want it . But you got ta keep up your strength , fella . If the warden do n't want it , try it on the governor . Guess he ai n't hungry . Dr . Simpson speaking . Yes , Warden . I 've just finished my report on Jarrett . Violent , homicidal . He 'll probably have recurrent periods of normal behavior , but ... Yes , sir . Our psychiatrists are coming tonight . They 'll commit him to the institution . Yes , Warden . I suggest you prepare the release for him . Thank you , Warden . - Oscillator all ready ? - Ready to sing , Phil . Put the car in the trees . We
zone1	Telephone , Mr . Evans . - All right . Hold it , boys . Evans speaking . Hello , Warden . That is bad news . Not altogether a surprise . Thanks for your cooperation anyway , Warden . Say , by the way , tomorrow there 'll be a pardon coming through ... for one of your inmates , Vic Pardo . Rush it through , will you ? Thanks . No dice , boys . The party 's off . Jarrett 's a raving maniac . They 've got him in a straitjacket . It 's a good thing for Hank it happened inside instead of out . It 's the only good thing about it . Take the oscillator off the car . I 'll get the plane tickets for 10:00 tonight . You have a car to take us to the Springfield airport ? It 'll be there , Mr . Evans . Sorry , boys . They ca n't all work out . How would you like a little change of scenery , Cody ? Someplace where we might be able to cure your
zone1	would you ? No . Might do me some good . - Doctor . - Not now , Ryley . I want something to eat . - You 've sent away two meals already . - That 's why I 'm hungry now . Hunger 's always a hopeful sign . Nobody feeds Cody Jarrett . What am I , a kid ? Is it all right to remove the straitjacket , Doctor ? I 'll do it . They got you tied up good . The examination 's over . All right , turn around . Now , keep them quiet . Doctor , you 're with me . I want you to make a little phone call for me . And no slip-ups , or you 're gon na need a doctor . You 're taking a little walk , boys . Doc wants you in the dispensary . Wait here . - Come on , Parker . - Where to ? Dispensary . Special invitation to the doctor . Here . Tie and gag him . Drop that stick . Now . Get in the cell .
zone1	the tuxedo with you . Reader , cover the outside door . We 'll not make it this way . We 'll never get to the gate . - Who says so ? - Why me ? What do you want with me ? You 're my pal . I 'm taking you with me . Come on . - Look ... - Get . You got me wrong . I got nothing against you . It was Big Ed . He told me to do it . You would n't kill me in cold blood , would you ? I 'll let you warm up a little . There 's the fingerprint that nailed me . Psycho , put that zoot suit on him . - Me ? - Yeah , you . Cody , my way , there would n't be no shooting . Ai n't gon na be any my way either . We 're going out of here in a car like gentlemen on a picnic . They want me to take a little trip . We 're gon na take a trip . Only it
zone1	. Get . Pick up those hats . Everybody down . Ryley , get those keys . You get in the trunk . Come on , get it open . Get in . Ryley , you get in the front . Reader , get in the back and make like you 're loony . And you , you drive . You know how jittery I am . Any minute I 'm liable to explode . Now if we do n't make it , I 've got six slugs in this gun . One for each of us . - Dr . Harris . - Good night , Doc . Hello . Yeah , speaking . What ? All right . Right away . Turn back . Jarrett 's busted out . Black sedan . Probably headed southwest . Following are the names of the men who escaped with Cody Jarrett . Thomas Ryley , Roy Parker , Michael Curtin , Vic Pardo . Do not shoot unless absolutely necessary . Hostages in car . Do not shoot ... - One break for our boy . - What 's Hank 's
zone1	gets what he 's after . I like your tailor . How do you like mine ? Tommy , rustle up some grub . You , in there . Vic , what 's taking you so long ? Trying to find some more artillery . - Let it ring . - Someone might get suspicious . Come on . How you doing , Parker ? It 's stuffy in here . I need some air . Stuffy , huh ? I 'll give you a little air . No clue to their movements has been reported ... since their assault last night on a service station ... north of Gallup , New Mexico . It is assumed now by federal law enforcement agencies ... that Jarrett and the other escaped convicts are heading for California . This concludes the nightly news summary from KFKL , San Bernardino . Did you check the windows ? - I said , " Did you check the windows ? " - Ed , let 's get out of here . Take it easy , baby . We 're ready for him when he comes
zone1	Listening , going crazy . It ai n't like waiting for some human being who wants to kill you . Cody ai n't human . Fill him full of lead , and he 'll still come at you . Plug him and he drops , same as anybody else . The boys did n't think so . Why did they beat it down to San Berdoo ? ' Cause they know this is between me and Cody . - They 'll be back when it 's over . - You 'll be dead . Maybe so . But the time comes when a man 's got ta stop running away and face things . Or else go on running for good . All right , throw your life away . Stay here and shoot it out . Me ? I 'm going . I want to live . Cody might have ideas about that . I 'll go someplace he 'll never find me . The world ai n't big enough , sugar . Not when he finds out what you did to his ma . - You 'd tell
zone1	- Why not ? - But I only did it for you , Ed . She had you covered . Cody still ai n't going to like to hear that she got it in the back . Feel more like staying now ? I said I 'd be back . Now tell me you 're glad to see me . Only say it low , so nobody can hear . Cody , I 'm so glad to see you . I 've been praying you 'd come back . I could n't stand it any longer . I was running away . - From Big Ed ? - Yeah . - What 's the matter ? Do n't you like him ? - No . Maybe you should n't have teamed up with him . I could n't help it , Cody . He said if I did n't go away with him , he 'd have you killed . All I wanted was for you to come back . That 's the truth . I love you , Cody . - You let Ma die ? - No .
zone1	. You just stood there and watched Big Ed kill her . I tell you , you got it wrong , Cody . Maybe you thought it was funny , an old woman taking on a guy like that . No . I tried to warn her ... but he caught me and beat me . Then when Ma came , he was waiting for her , and he ... - I ca n't tell you . - Tell me . He got her in the back . - Is he in there now ? - Yeah . But you got ta be careful , Cody . He 's got the house rigged up like a trap . You ca n't get in unless I tell you how . - Ed . - Stay where you are . - What was that bell downstairs ? - It was me , Ed . What were you doing down there ? I could n't go through with it . I tried , but I could n't . Talk sense . I was going to take the car and beat it . I
zone1	anymore . You 're my honey . Still got nerves ? Please , Ed . I feel like a drink . - Fix me one , too . - Here . Catch . Listen , Cody . Ed said this joint is a cinch . - Good for $50,000 . - Who ? - Big Ed . - Never heard of him . Go on . The way we had it figured , Cody , we pile out of the cars here ... we slug the guards , and we grab the payroll here . Blast our way out . It 'll all take 50 seconds . They got cars . They 'd follow you . That 's where we use the gas truck . I 'll stall it right in the gates . And when we beat it in the getaway cars , I got the truck keys in my pocket . And where do you get the gas truck ? We got one stashed behind a barn . Bought it with our own dough . $12,000 . - You bought a gas truck ? - Yeah . What
zone1	? Maybe it ai n't so bad , Cody . $12,000 gets you $50,000 . Fence $50,000 , and you get $20,000 . Then what are you going to do with that ? Buy two more gas trucks ? That joint has got the serial number of every bill . Any guy who says he can fence $50,000 is crazy . - The Trader ai n't crazy . - The Trader ? - Who 's he ? - My manager , kid . Come on . Let 's get a look at that $12,000 doll . Cody . My radio ai n't working again . Oh , no . What do you want it for , unemployment insurance ? Ca n't I go down to San Berdoo and get it fixed ? Nobody leaves unless I say so . Now , you ... What 's the matter , baby ? I 'm not gon na hurt you . Go and read your comic books . Good girl . This fellow you call the Trader ... can you trust him ? Why ? I would n't like to see my share
zone1	. - Suspicious , ai n't you ? - Just careful . You do n't have to worry about the Trader . He pays off on the spot in nice , clean bills . Where does he get rid of this stuff ? - Ships to Europe . Collects both ends . - Smart operator . Did n't see any of that dope from that tunnel job pop up , did you ? I like him better now . Not bad . Maybe the $12,000 do n't go down the drain after all . - Hey , Het . - Yeah . You 're pretty good with a blowtorch . You suppose you could cut a hole in here into the tank ? Yeah , sure . We 're back in business , boys . We 're back in business . And not Big Ed 's way either , and not for $50,000 . But first , a question . Supposing you want to push in a place like Fort Knox ... and grab yourselves a couple of tons of gold ... what 's the toughest thing about a job
zone1	dollar for the gentleman on the balcony . Right on the button . Getting in . Which brings me to a story Ma used to tell me when I was a kid . A story about a horse . Way back , there was a whole army trying to knock over a place called Troy ... and getting nowhere fast . Could n't even put a dent in the walls . One morning , the people of Troy wake up , look over the walls ... and the attacking army disappeared . Men , boats , the works . Taking a powder . But they left one thing after them ... a great , big wooden horse . And according to Ma ... Hello , there . I was wondering if I could use your telephone ? There ai n't a phone here for five miles . I 'm sorry to hear that . - Good morning . - Hello . Lost your way , mister ? No . I wanted to call my office ... but these gentlemen say you do n't have a phone here . They would
zone1	I 'll show you where it is . Thank you very much . There 's a call that 's gon na cost more than a nickel . Looks like Big Ed 's gon na have company . And we got a new station wagon . - How 's fishing ? - Fine , Cody . - Good catch . - You like the truck idea ? It 's admirable . We might all profit by a closer study of classical literature . Chemical plant . I guess that 's Long Beach way . That 's close enough for now . You know the way I work . I must ask that you do n't insist on knowing the exact location ... until you 've reached the rendezvous . That 's all right . The only thing that matters is ... how much dough this joint has in the kitty . $426,000 will be placed in their safe before closing time tomorrow ... to be distributed to deserving employees the following morning ... provided there 's no unforeseen accident , of course . - Like me and my boys ? -
zone1	they found they went to school together . Maybe they 're buddies after all . Something funny 's going on there . I 've had my eye on this place for several months . Now , these checking gates , that means a pass for the driver ... identity cards and stuff . We 're all hot . Your truck will be driven past these checkers ... by an ex-convict of my acquaintance . He 's now leading a scrupulously honest life ... as a truck driver for this very firm . Smooth . Sorry to bust in . We 're finished out there . Wan na check ? I 'll be right out . - You having much luck , mister ? - I have n't started yet ... I 'm just on my way . - Done much fishing up here ? - Every year . - What are you trying for ? - Bass . - This guy 's a phony , Cody . - I beg your pardon ? This is trout country . There ai n't bass for 100 miles . What 's so funny
zone1	Bass . He got you , did n't he ? Trader , this is the kid I 've been telling you about . Meet Vic Pardo . - Hello . - Glad to know you , Mr ... Forgive me , I ... You can forget that . Vic 's my partner , 50-50 . Cody Jarrett going 50-50 ? - I split even with Ma , did n't I ? - I see . My name 's Daniel Winston . San Diego . Securities . Glad to know you , Mr . Winston . Sit down . Hold it . Where you going , Pardo ? - What 's doing , kid ? - I do n't like being pushed around . My orders was nobody was to leave . That might go for hoods like him . When I got a reason to leave , I leave . Nobody has any reasons I do n't know about . - He jumped me , Cody . - Get back on the job . That was pretty fancy wrestling , kid . Where 'd you learn it ? - In
zone1	do n't take cons in the army . When the war broke out , I did n't have any record except kid stuff . What were you doing just now , soldier ? Going over the hill ? No . I figured maybe I 'd run in to L.A . Be back before anyone knew . - What 's doing in L.A . ? - My wife . She do n't know where I am . When we crashed out , I did n't leave no forwarding address . - It 's the truth , Cody . - Why did n't you ask me ? I figured you might get sore . So you took off on your own . I have n't seen her in a long time . I 'm human , you know , like everyone else . All right , kid . You 're just lonesome . Lonesome like me . You ? - What about ... - You mean Verna ? All I ever had was Ma . Now ... Your mother alive ? No , she died before I even knew her . I
zone1	- That sounds funny to you ? - No . Some might think so . My old lady never had anything . Always on the run , always on the move . Some life . First , it was my old man , died kicking and screaming in a nut house ... then my brother , and after that , it was taking care of me . Always trying to put me on top . " Top of the world , " she used to say . And then , times when I 'd be losing my grip ... there she 'd be , right behind me ... pushing me back up again . And now ... Anyway , she quit running , Cody . Yeah . Quit running . That was a good feeling out there , talking to her . Just me and Ma . A good feeling . I liked it . Maybe I am nuts . Let 's go in and have a drink . Tell you what , Vic . I 've got an idea . We 'll pick up your wife after the job
zone1	Just the four of us . No kidding , Cody . That sounds great . You mean that , honey ? We could have fun . Live big . Money 's just paper if you do n't spend it . - That 's an idea . - It 's a good idea . Europe , maybe . Paris . Rubbing shoulders with the best of them . How do you do , Countess ? Sable coats , jewels just dripping from my fingers . I 'd knock their eyes out , Cody . You 'd be real proud of me . Do n't go flipping your lid . He ai n't thought of a vacation in years , Vic . Do n't let him forget it . Here 's to us , top of the world . How 's the radio coming , Verna ? - A crystal set would play better . - Yeah ? Maybe I could fix it for you . I wish you would , Vic . I 'm dead without music . We 'll get a new one . I do n't mind fixing it
zone1	sleep anyhow . Anything you say , kid . - I was just gon na throw it away . - I 'm not making any promises . We better hit the hay , Duchess . We got a heavy day tomorrow . - See you in the morning . - Right . Grab the brass ring . What are you doing ? We 're on our way . You 've got to have a chain on the ground , get rid of electricity . That 's only when you got gasoline or chemicals inside . You want to have some traffic cop think you got a load of something else ? That 's using your head , kid . All right , snap it up . You all know what you 're to do ... and you know where the rendezvous is . We 're to pick up our driver there at 5:00 ... and we 'll be at the plant right after the day shift has checked off . Now , Vic and Tommy , we go in the truck . The rest of you go with Verna in
zone1	for speeding . But get them there . Do n't worry , honey . I 'll get them there . $12,000 and she 's getting ready to blow up in your face . Might be a cracked radiator . We 'd better stop somewhere . There 's a gas station down the hill , Cody . Pull in and watch yourself . Fill her up ? - With water , bub . Check that radiator . - Okay . - You got a washroom , mister ? - Yeah . Cleanest in the West . Dry as a bone . Go get Vic . Hurry up . - Cody says to hurry up . - All right . I thought you said cleanest in the West . You ever see a cleaner one , mister ? - The mirror 's so dirty you can see double . - What ? Wise guys . Did n't even buy gas . Into the wooden horse , boys . Where do we go , Trader ? You should be back in about three hours . - I 'll wait . - We 'll
zone1	having a cup of coffee . He 'll be right out . Bo . I heard you wanted to straighten out . Driving a truck for a living . - Tonight , I hand in my resignation . - You better get going , Cody . Good luck . Got it ? When you get to the plant , park across the street . If there 's any trouble , give us the horn hard . How is it in there ? Ca n't breathe good . Otherwise , fine . Stop breathing . There 's a button up in the cab . Press it once if trouble shows , and three times for all clear . Okay . Somebody 's ribbing you , Russ . Take a slant at the mirror in your washroom . " Radio Signal Fallon . " You know what that means , sir ? You bet I know what it means . It 's Hank . Call the FCC .

They must have stopped . 198th and Figueroa . - Check . 198th and Figueroa . -
zone1	cars proceed to 198th and Figueroa . Drop the gun . Now turn around . - Cody , that guy 's a copper . - What ? He 's a T-man . I know him . His name is Fallon . He pinched me four years ago . Do n't go for your guns . A copper . A copper . How do you like that , boys ? A copper and his name is Fallon . And we went for it . I went for it . Treated him like a kid brother . And I was going to split 50-50 with a copper . Maybe they 're waiting to pin a medal on him . Solid gold . Come on . Get up . Get your hands up . Yeah , that 's it . A nice gold medal for the copper . Only maybe he 's gon na get it sooner than he thinks . Cody , the joint 's crawling with cops . - Let him have it . - Oh , no . And lose our ace in the hole ? He 's going to
zone1	copper ? Get up . It wo n't work . They 'll shoot just the same . - They wo n't shoot one of their own . - They wo n't make any deals . You better pray that they do . Jarrett , you and your men might as well give up . Come out with your hands up . We 've got your boy Fallon in here , and he 'll be all right if you do as I say . She says she can get Jarrett to come out . If I can , mister , will you go easy on me ? I 'll tell him you 'll let him get away because you do n't want your guy hurt . He 'll believe me . Then , when he comes out , you can do what you want with him . No deal . Lock her up . Cheap copper ! Jarrett , you have n't got a chance . Come out with your hands up . " Come out with your hands up , " the man says . How do you like that
zone1	... Fan out ! Give them tear gas from both sides . That was Cody Jarrett talking ! Out this way , Cody . Through that door . Here 's yours , copper . Wait a minute . It 's Fallon . - You all right , Hank ? - Yeah , sure . Quick ... get a car out to Charlie 's Roadhouse , Highway 60 , near Colton . Pick up Daniel Winston . He 's the fence you 're looking for . - What 's out here , Bo ? - An alley . Happy , try it . Come on . Get going . We 've got Bo Creel . They 're heading up . Got them on the ground heading for the Horton Sphere area . Send men out to that section . Pass the word along . Do n't fire unless you 've got a perfect target . That place is a stack of dynamite . Have that area surrounded . Get some searchlights . They think they 've got Cody Jarrett . They have n't got Cody Jarrett , you hear ? They
zone1	show you they have n't got him . Come on . Come with me . Do n't shoot . It 's me , Ryley . I 'm coming out . You might as well come down , Jarrett . There 's no one left but you . Come and get me . Get the gun , Hank . What 's holding him up ? Made it , Ma ! Top of the world ! Cody Jarrett . He finally got to the top of the world . And it blew right up in his face .
zone1	6017201 BIG BEN CHIMES Excuse me , could you tell me the way to Nutbourne College ? You must be the new English master ! Yes . Richard Tassell . My name 's Billings . I teach Maths . The carriage should be without . Hello , Rainbow , old scout ! Aye , aye , sir . How was Mon Repos , Southsea ? Middling , sir . This is mr . Tassell , the new English master . Pleased to meet you . Keep on the right side of Rainbow . He runs the school and knows the country . Black-market whisky , butter , eggs , anything at a price , right , Rainbow ? Times are difficult , sir . Is this your first appointment ? Yes . Ex-service ? Army . Pond interviewed you , I suppose . What did you make of him ? He seemed quite pleasant . He 's bats . You 're going to loathe it here . That 's a fine way of introducing me to it ( ! ) Oh , I see you 've been putting in a spot of work on the garden for a change ,
zone1	He 's been on at me and Edwin all the week . " Clean this up . Paint that . " Has n't given us a moment . Must be expecting a gaggle of parents . There are six cottages in the village , a pub and a post office . We are now entering the main hall of the noble pile . According to history , it goes back to Henry VIII . According to the bank , it goes back to THEM , unless Pond keeps up with his payments . Fine old staircase ... Mmm . ... but you have to climb it 20 times a day . And this is the common room . Haven from howling kids and the back parlour of our domestic life . You 'll find your evenings here rollicking ( ! ) Matthews - he 's the second master - plays a good hand of ecarte . Joue here suffers from insomnia . JOUE SNORES Takes French and he plays backgammon ... when he 's awake . I 'll introduce you to him later . What about you ? What do
zone1	bob . It 's led me astray ever since . HORN PLAYS A TUNE - What 's that ? - Hyde-Brown . Known to the natives as Whizzo . He 's the sports master . He 's the only chap who is n't really affected by this place . Oh , I 'm sorry if I 'm painting a gloomy picture . Oh , hello , Ramsden . This is Tassell , the new English master . - How do you do ? - How do you do ? He 's the science master . We call him the Ghost of Nutbourne . Ha ! How are you , Billings , you jaundiced swine ? Oh , had the devil of a journey . Thought I 'd never make it . Nearly ran out of juice . Must get old Rainbow to get me some more petrol coupons . Hello ? Hello . That you , Joan , dear ? Look , get me Ashfield 69 . I 'm not going to pay what he asked last term - seven bob a gallon . This is Tassell , the new
zone1	, old boy ? ... Hello ? Hello ? That you , Alf ? Vic here . Look , what won the 4.30 ? ... Oh . What was second and third ? ... Oh . Did ... Winter Cottage run ? Oh , thanks . ... Just my luck . I say , Tassell , you can have this cupboard . What 's that ass Pond been up to ? This place has n't had a coat of paint since they took photographs for the prospectus . I say , you chaps , take a butcher 's at these . This is a little job I ran across in a joint in Montmartre . She comes from Birkenhead actually . The one with the advanced ideas - that 's Jeanne . Wo n't you ever grow up ? I certainly hope not . That 's Yvette . What a scorcher . It 's I'amour , old man . You 'll gather Brownie is interested in a wide variety of sports ( ! ) There you are , Billings . I expected you earlier . You 're not going to
zone1	sort ? What is it ? I put a notice on the board . Mr Tassell , I take it ? How do you do ? How do you do ? I 'm Matthews , the second master . You 'll find us a very happy family here . Since when ? ! What is it on the board , Matty . Really , it 's only three yards . Mr . Pond wants to go to tea today . Tea ? ! That 's the first time . What 's the idea ? I have n't the remotest notion . It 's about 5.30 and I saw mrs . Hampstead going in with the tea about two minutes ago . We have no alternative but to investigate this strange phenomenon . Let 's go . Oh , do you want ... wary Willy ? Oh , dear , oh , dear , oh , dear ! And before term 's started . Monsieur Joue . Wake up , Monsieur Joue . Wake up ! J'aurai , tu auras , il aura ... He has n't had Rainbow and Edwin
zone1	free bun fight , ... there 's something brewing apart from tea . Maybe he 's getting married and wants to impress the lady . The day Pond exchanges a smile with a woman , ... I 'll dance the hornpipe naked on the village green . And as for anything in this dump impressing anyone ... HE KNOCKS Come in , gentlemen , please . POND LAUGHS Excuse me . Tea is served . POND CHUCKLES Mr Tassell . Welcome to Nutbourne . Delighted to have you join us . My colleagues , I 'm sure , will tell you all you need to know about the school . Right , Billings ? Sit down , gentlemen , sit down . Lend me a hand with the tea , will you , Billings , please ? Well , I hope you all enjoyed your vacations . Come in Matthews , Joue . Here we are all once again back in harness . And I , for one , can say that I 'm ... I 'm not sorry . Sit down , Ramsden . Yes , it 's 15
zone1	forget the sugar , Billings . 15 years since I came here . And I must say it 's 15 years that I shall look back on with a very deepest affection . There 'll be many more to look back upon before you and Nutbourne part company , sir . I appreciate that sentiment , Matthews . But I 'm afraid it 's a ... a pleasure that may not be granted to me . Oh , come , sir ! Ha-ha , yes ! Are these crumpets ? I do n't know ( ! ) As a matter of fact , that is why I 've asked you all to come here . There is a distinct possibility that I may be translated to a higher sphere . Not your heart again , sir ? My heart is perfectly all right , Billings . No , I 've been urged to consider an appointment elsewhere . No , sir ! Yes , the headmastership of Harlingham . But that 's a decent school . One of the majors . This is a shock . I hardly dare think
zone1	would be a tremendous wrench for me , too , Matthews . Oh ! Crumpets it is . Plates , Billings . But , Matthews , that the call of duty comes before even that of affection . And the call of duty would be stronger at Harlingham , sir ? I have always felt that the highest aim of a teacher is to sow the seeds of knowledge of ever wider , more fertile fields . We 're a comparatively small school here , and judging from recent examination results , not abundantly fertile . Give Joue his tea , will you , Billings , please ? Which brings me to my second point . The governors of Harlingham will shortly be visiting here to study my methods . Then you have n't cornered the job yet , sir ? ! The problem is a mutual one , Billings . Will Harlingham suit me ? Will I be equal to Harlingham ? Mmm , crumpets are nice , sir . Thank you , Matthews . I 'm sure with your co-operation and perhaps a little a little extra effort
zone1	our school is every bit as good as ... Ramsden . Will you please sit down ? Oh , and bearing this in mind , Mr Joue , do you think you might contrive to spend a little more of the day with us ? Thank you , Joue . And you , Billings ... Billings , do you think you could devote a little more of your time to obtaining class results and a little less to trying to forecast the football variety , hmm ? ! Good . And talking of football , Hyde-Brown , I seem to recall that last year , our first XV lost 11 out of the 12 matches . POND CHUCKLES Might I suggest in your case a little more of the coach , ... a little less of the Coach and Horses ? Oh , I say , that 's a bit of a reflection , is n't it , sir ? Come , come , come ! You must n't think , gentlemen , that I make these comments in a spirit of carping criticism . DOOR OPENS On the contrary
zone1	you mind telling me how many new boys there is this term ? Rainbow , you know better than to interrupt my conferences ! I gave you a note this morning . We 're expecting TWO . You may be expecting two , sir . You 're going to get 102 ! See mr . Matthews about it later and go away now , please ! ... I 'm sorry . " 217 trunks , 217 tuck boxes " , it says here . " Invoice 7348 " , er ... " British Railways " . I 'm not in the least concerned about what the British Railways think it is . It 's a mistake . Take it away and forget about it ! You ca n't hardly forget 217 trunks and tuck boxes , sir . This is worse than teaching algebra to the remove . It 's only on paper , man . On paper ! Take a look a the drive , sir . Drive ? ! 217 trunks and tuck boxes ! Uh ! 217 ? ! Good gracious ! And all correct too ,
zone1	comes of nationalising the railways . The fellows do n't know their LMS from the Southern Region . Instead of the ordinary muddle , we 've complete chaos . You and Edwin will have to send those trunks ... that do n't belong to us back to the station . How do I know which do n't belong ? Check the register . If there 's any clash about names , you can tell by the initials . Here we have a D Johnson . Now , we have an A Johnson , but no ... But this is addressed to " St Swithin 's , " Nutbourne College , Nutbourne , Hants " . There 's another St Swithin 's here , sir . I suppose this is n't some fourth-form prank ? I do n't offer this as a solution , sir , but a letter came this morning addressed to the Secretary of St Swithin 's . What did you do with it ? I marked it " unknown " , returned it to the Ministry . The Ministry ? ! The Ministry wrote to St Swithin
zone1	n't open it ? Oh , no , of course not . Excuse me , sir , but I may be able to offer a helping hand here , sir . Oh ? You know the postman 's supposed to clear the box in the hall at midday ? Yes , well ? Well , as a result of an arrangement between him and me , I 've been in the habit of taking the post to the village for him . And today you have n't ? Not yet , but , er ... I 've got the key , sir . I see . Then the GPO do n't receive the letters until you hand them over in the village post office . Er ... pub , sir . That poses a pretty problem as to when exactly the letters become the property of the Post Office . It 's not a problem I intend to go into too deeply . " The attached form E.43 should also be signed by a responsible representative of the school whose premises are being shared . " " Whose premises are
zone1	happened ? " Name of school to be re-evacuated ... " Re-evacuated ? ! What on earth 's re-evacuated ? ! Someone 's written against it " St Swithin 's " . That 's them . " Destination Nutbourne College , Hants . " Us . " Date of arrival , 17th September ... " Today . But it ca n't ! I mean , it ca n't ! I 'll get on to this Government department at once . Whitehall 1312 , please . ... If anyone should send a school here without first consulting me - ... it 's outside the bounds of possibility . Shall I stop Rainbow ... taking that luggage to the station ? Certainly not . If the ... Hello , I want to speak to the Schools Resettlement Department , please . I beg your pardon ? But there must be somebody there . Put me on to somebody somewhere else . Nobody ? ! It 's fantastic ( ! ) It 's absolutely fantastic ( ! ) They 've closed the office and gone home . So , at any moment ,
zone1	must talk to Mrs Hampstead at once . 100 extra boys . With staff , I presume . Not even a postcard to let us know they 're coming . Nothing we can do about it until I talk to someone in the morning . We 've barely enough space for our own boys . You rang , sir . I did . Mrs . Hampstead , you will prepare to receive 217 boys . Pardon ? 117 of our boys and 100 from another school . I see . The ... the other school will remain for one night only . Now , let me get this clear , sir . I 'm to expect 217 boys tonight ? That 's right . There 's only one way to deal with a crisis like this . First ... What are they going to eat ? Mmm ? Well , they 'll have what we have , of course . Well , if they have it , we wo n't . Do you mind if we deal with first things first ? With small boys - that comes first .
zone1	room in the dormitories , ... so ... we 'll have to find somewhere else . At Harlingham , I 'll be dealing with far greater numbers of boys . This might prove a blessing . That 's one way of looking at it ! Yes ! ... Well , I propose we make a tour of the school . With a little application , we can settle the whole problem . Shall I get Rainbow to unload those trunks ? Oh , yes . I 'd forgotten all about them . Come along , everybody . Oh , Matthews , as to bedding , we 've all those straw palliasses we used in summer camp . I 'll have Rainbow get ' em out . Sir , while you 're running around , I 'll slip down and break the good news to cook . Mrs Hampstead , we are faced with an emergency . I expect the staff to rise to it . They 'll rise all right ( ! ) Good . Phew ! I do n't know how it 's ever going to get as far
zone1	take you to load that lot ? Oh , 25 minutes . Well , you 've got a chance to beat it . You 've got to unload it again . Huh ? St Swithin 's is coming to stay for the night . You 're not speaking in earnest ? That 's the strength of it , sorry . Phew ! Somebody must have gone barmy . 100 bloomin ' extra kids first day of term ! Your turn to do the shoes . The staff sleeping problem presents some difficulties . Whose room is this ? Hyde-Brown 's and mine . Pleasant little room . Now , let 's see , ... do you think we might put two more beds in here , hmm ? Any difficulties ? None , except how to get into bed . You 're not adopting a very helpful attitude , Billings . We 're obliged to offer the school our hospitality . I suggest we do it with grace . It 's not too much to ask you to share your rooms with the staff . We wo n't find suitable
zone1	me to give you a lead , ... Billings , I must say that I should be only too glad to share my room with my opposite number in St Swithin 's . As I expected - an ancient mausoleum . Topping grounds for the Guides and Brownies to muster in . The mustering of the Guides and Brownies is not our only activity , miss Gossage . No . If there are any dorms facings south , Miss Jezzard , see that our girls get them . The infant animal needs space to breathe and blow . We could settle the whole thing quickly by sleeping the kids two in a bed . End to end . We 've the parents to consider . We must appear to give them value for their money . No , I 'm afraid we must seek other fields for St Swithin 's . That 's a thought . Mmm ? Fields , sir . I 'm quite sure , Hyde-Brown , your ready wit must make you exceedingly popular in the fourth form . Heavenly place . I never heard of anything
zone1	obliging someone , ... but he 's not obliging US . We 're not slaves . Nobody said you were . BELL RINGS The front door bell 's ringing , Milly . Oh , let it ring . I shall speak to Mr Hyde-Brown about this . Evidently not on their toes . We 'll try our luck inside . Well , a tap on that gong should bring them from their burrows . Yes , miss Whitchurch . LOUD BONGS A tap , Gossage . I said a tap . You 're not introducing a film . We 're not getting on very fast , gentlemen . There are still 60 boys to accommodate . GONG SOUNDS Matthews , find out who 's ringing that gong . If it 's one of the boys , give him 100 lines . There must be somewhere else . Uh ... The attic . We ca n't bumble around here all day . ... What 's in there ? It 's another sort of hall , miss Whitchurch . I seem to detect an odour of last term 's cottage pie .
zone1	all this up , there ought to be room here for about , ooh , 60 boys . What about air , sir ? Air ? ! Oof ! Let me see now . Well , if we open this skylight ... Mmm ! Well , I daresay it will open . And keep the hatch wide , there ought to be a nice through draught . I 'm wondering more and more what 's in store for us , Gossage . It 's a perfectly ghoulish atmosphere . The sunlight seems quite out of place . No polish on the stairs or banisters , and dust everywhere ! Whatever else they teach here , it certainly is n't housecraft . Are you in the habit of writing your name all over the place , Gossage ? No , Miss Whitchurch . Then kindly stop doing it at once . SHE KNOCKS Well , the mistresses ' common room , I assume . Huh . Cold comfort farm by all appearances ! And billiards ! How very strange . No tips . Huntin ' , shootin ' and fishin '
zone1	. But no mention of who caught it . Probably bought at auction . Boxing ! Self-defence , I suppose . Well , does n't surprise me after reading the school motto . No . Heavy smokers , too . No signs of lipstick . That 's astonishing . Cards ? ! The Racehorse ? ! Gaming , nicotine , fisticuffs - ... we 're moving in a descending spiral of iniquity ! Ah ! A woman 's bookshelf is an infallible guide to her character . Oxford English Dictionary , Dictionary Of Phrase And Fable , The Diary Of Samuel Pepys - abridged . Well , that 's something to be thankful for ( ! ) What 's up here ? A-hem . Memoirs Of Casanova . Was n't that the book we caught Jessica James reading in the closet ? Yes . Yes . Decameron Nights . Well , really ! Whatever else this establishment may or may not be , ... it 's clearly not a suitable place to bring carefully nurtured girls to . I should jolly well say not . But what can we do
zone1	got us into it . They must get us out of it . Well , that settles the sleeping question . Now , it 's the meals . Cook will simply have to stagger them . That should n't be difficult . Come along . Rainbow can bring down the table from the carpenter 's shop . What 's this ? " Gossage " ? Mmm ? Some of the boys starting to arrive ? Give the boy who wrote his name there 50 lines . " Gossage " ? I do n't know any Gossages . Maybe it 's a St Swithin 's kid . Then give him 50 lines . I 'll not have their boys writing their names all over our dust ... Who 's that ? Er , little girl . Yes ? Who ... Who are you ? I mean , what do you want ? This is Nutbourne College . That 's right . I just biked on ahead with Miss Harper 's things . She 's with the crocodile . Crocodile ? ! What on earth 's she talking about ? Who ...
zone1	she 's English and history and jolly dee ! In fact , she 's the only decent mistress in St Swithin 's . St Swithin 's ? ! You do n't mean to say that yours is a school of boys AND girls ? Oh , no ! Only girls . Does this mean , sir , that we are to expect 100 young ladies ? It means not only have the Ministry made a mistake in sending a school here at all , ... but they 've apparently been guilty of an appalling sexual aberration . I shall ask for the home number of the man responsible . If they refuse , I shall speak to the Minister himself . Do you know what this means , old boy ? Popsies , scores of them . There are only two types of school mistress , chum - the battleaxe and the Amazon . I bet you five bob they fall into one class or the other . The condition of the place is indescribable . Dust and dirt everywhere . And the staff seem to match their surroundings .
zone1	no place to bring well-brought-up girls to ... I agree with that last statement . Will you kindly remove yourself from my chair , my telephone ... Sorry , I did n't catch what you said ... Will you kindly move yourself from my telephone ? ! Will you please refrain from interfering ? I do n't know who you are , but I 'm in the middle of a conversation with the Ministry . Ministry ? ! Hello ? Give me that ! Will you desist at once , sir ? ! You leave me no alternative . How dare you , sir ? How dare YOU , madam ? ! Hello , hello . This is Wetherby Pond speaking , ... the headmaster of Nutbourne College . I do n't know how much you know about what 's going on here , ... but I will not have a girls ' school on my premises , ... not for a single day , not for a single hour , not ... I do n't want your sympathy , man . I want action . I want these women
zone1	down this telephone until I know what you 're going to do about it . Have I made myself clear ? Oh , yeah , I understand . But I think you 'd better have a word with the guv'nor when he comes back . Where is he ? Eh ? I think he 's stoking the boilers . To whom am I talking ? Thank you . You were speaking to the junior assistant caretaker . The Ministry is closed ! I take it you are some sort of official in this girls ' school . I do n't like your tone , my man . I 'll answer you when you 're in possession of yourself . Madam , I 'm well able to control myself . Unaccustomed as I am to having girls ' schools thrust upon me , ... no doubt , in years to come , I shall look upon this as amusing . But I sha n't . The only solution is to send your girls back home until the whole position is rectified . Out of the question . At least 50 of
zone1	they come from ! It is impossible for them to remain here . It is equally impossible for them to go elsewhere . At any moment now , they 'll be arriving , ... hot and tired from their journey , bursting for a hot bath and peckish for their high tea . By the way , a-hem , ... my name is Whitchurch . I am Principal of St Swithin 's . Oh ... How do you ... ? How do you do ? What 's more , I make it a rule that junior school go up the wooden hill to Bedfordshire at 6.30 sharp with their milk and biscuits - digestive . Have you digestive ? I do n't know . But if there are any , they 'll be eaten by my boys . Oh , come now , it 's no use playing dog in the manger . Let us face this squarely . Which day do your boys arrive ? Today at 6.15 , hot , tired and peckish for their high tea . Yes , I see your problem . I 'm grateful
zone1	Madam , I 'm not donning anything . Oh ! We 've just been hurled out of our common room ... By a bunch of ruffians . One pulled me out of my chair . Miss Whitchurch , you realise where we are ? You do n't imagine I 've been here indulging in social chit-chat . Mr Pond , permit me to introduce my staff . No , no , no , no , no . I do n't want to appear rude , but there 's no point in meeting them since they 're not going to remain here . But , madam , I am surprised that you should ignore the domestic absurdity of bringing 100 girls here . There are feeding problems , servant problems ... There 's no problem there , sir . They 're leaving . Left , right . Left , right . Left ... Oh , good egg ! Here 's comes our croc ! And there goes OURS . Three years it 's taken me to get a good kitchen staff . What am I to do ? That 's childishly
zone1	with you . Forget ( ! ) It will provide an absolutely superb opportunity for my advanced cookery girls to show their paces . No , madam , not that . Not that ! That 's more than flesh and blood can stand . I 'll go through purgatory with you , but hell - no ! Hell , no ! I owe you a dollar . Thanks . We 're in for a whale of a time . Morris dancing in the gym , eurhythmics on the lawn ... Queues for the bathroom , no smoking anywhere , ... and compulsory cocoa at 11 . I 'm for a couple of voluntary pints at the Coach and Horses before the little beasts arrive . Any takers ? I 'll gladly stand anyone a pint if they 'll care to join me . I 'm a lifelong teetotaller , but I 'm almost inclined to accept Brown 's invitation . I 'm GOING to . Is this right ? Yes , it 's right . Press on . Straight ahead . Let me ... This has cost me five bob
zone1	. Good afternoon . Oh . Oh , I 'm sorry . That 's quite all right . Allow me . Thank you . I 'm Richard Tassell . I teach English here . So do I , but ... We 'll have something in common ! I 'm Victor Hyde-Brown , sports master here . Wo n't you sit down , Miss ... ? Harper . ... Harper . The rot 's setting in . Cigarette ? Thank you . I never expected anything like this . How many mistresses have you ? Well , I , er ... DOOR OPENS I must talk to you , gentlemen . We 're in an unprecedented predicament . Miss Harper - Mr Pond . How do you do ? How do you do ? Your colleagues are in the first door on the right . May I leave my things here ? Yes , of course . Who is he ? I 'll explain later . Hyde-Brown , will you please close that door ? Thank you . Now , gentlemen , we are faced with an appalling dilemma . We
zone1	nine points of the law . Our girls are in the hall , their boys have n't arrived . Come in , Miss Harper . Did you pass a long , bald-headed person ? You mean Pond ? He 's in the common room . Excellent . We 'll find out where their dormitories are and take our girls there . Ladies , you 're facing your supreme test . Remember our netball cry . Effort , St Swithin 's , effort ! Quite so , Miss Gossage . If trespassers threaten your property , you build fences . Hmm ? I propose we lock the dormitories . Hear , hear ! But we must act before that female spawns her young all over the building . Billings , take the fourth-form dormitory , and Hyde-Brown , the fifth . And Matthews and Joue , the third and the sixth . Have you got a key to the common room , sir ? We do n't have to lock this room , Billings ? No , and we ca n't UNLOCK it unless you 've got a key . Is
zone1	outside . This is the last straw . Come along now . Hurry up ! We 've got plenty to do . Stand by , Tennyson , Longfellow . Miss Armstrong , as quick as you can . No time to lose . The honour of Nutbourne is at stake . All right . I 'll have a go , ... but it 's not much use unlocking the stable door after the horses have got there first . What 's happening up there ? Hey , look out , sir ! Gosh , it 's old Whizzo ! Hey , Whizzo ! That 's it , Hyde-Brown . That 's it . Press on . BOYS CHEER AND WHISTLE That 's it . You 're almost there . You 're doing splendidly , Hyde-Brown . BOYS CHEER AND WHISTLE Do n't look down ! Carry on . ... Go in at once , you boys . Go straight upstairs to your dormitories and stay there till I call you . Any boy left hanging about will get 500 lines . Now , then , one leap and you 've
zone1	down as quickly as you can . I 'll have their trunks sent up in a few minutes . Very well . Not in here , Miss Gossage . Follow me , Milton and Browning . Quick as you can . No dawdling . I say , Talbot , there 's girls in our dormitory . Girls ? ! Where ? ! Hundreds of them . They 're everywhere . Have you gone potty ? What are you talking about ? Go and see for yourself . They 're all over the place . He 's right . There are . That 's what I 've been trying to tell them . Let 's see . This way , Milton and Browning . Come along , girls . Come along . I realise it 's not quite what you 're accustomed to . GIRL SCREAMS What 's that ? There 's trouble already . It 's something in Tennyson . Let 's go and see at once . Oh ! SCREAMING You must stop ! You must stop ! You must ... MISS WHITCHURCH WHISTLES Are n't you going to
zone1	think , when little boys should be seen but not interrupted . Come . COCK CROWS BELL RINGS BELL CONTINUES Where am I ? The French master 's bed . SNORING BELL RINGS LOUDLY BELL CONTINUES TO RING Madam , I ... Really , this is too much . I give up my bedroom to you , only to find my clothes flung all over the place . Look , madam , where are my shirts and underwear ? In the filing cabinet . It 's no use telephoning the Ministry . There wo n't be anybody there before ten o'clock . It 's rough and ready , Jezzard , but it 'll serve . Yes . Thank you . There we are . Now we 'd better see how they 're faring in the kitchen . Breakfast is at eight sharp , so do n't loiter . DOOR SLAMS Good morning , girls . Morning , Miss Whitchurch . Everything shipshape and Bristol fashion ? Yes , Miss Whitchurch . The fishcakes are ready , but there 's a hold-up with the porridge . Why ? I had to
zone1	do . Now , Angela , you 've made porridge before . Yes , but no-one had to eat it . That 's a defeatist attitude , my dear . Stir it well and do n't shilly-shally . Now , now , now , Mary ! You know better than to make tea in that haphazard fashion . How many people are you making it for ? 233 . Then put in 233 teaspoonsful and one ... well , perhaps two for the pot . One ... two ... I understand your fishcakes are ready , Alice . For the past 20 minutes . I do n't want any temperament , my dear . What did you put in them ? Or should n't I ask ? Anyway , they smell delicious . They 've gone hard . Never mind . I do n't suppose hungry little tummies will notice that . They will afterwards . 28 ... 29 ... 130 ... These little adventures break the monotony of school life . I love monotony . Oh . Morning , Mr Pond . Oh . I 'll just have tea
zone1	There 's been a slight hiatus with the porridge . Shall we move in ? What form of grace do you say here ? Well , I usually ask that we should be grateful for what we 're about to receive . Please , sir , I do n't want any more . No , sir . Oh , very well . It 's still Arkwright , but he 's trying to put me on to a Mr Tripp . Apparently Mr Bullock got the papers from Mr Forrester . He passed them on to Mr Arkwright who passed them on to Mr Tripp . We 've got to sit here while they keep on passing around ... The girls must write home , Miss Gossage . Rely on their discretion . The younger girls are the trouble , Miss Whitchurch . Monica Redfern wrote , " Dear Mummy , I 'm having an exciting time . " We 've been sent to a boys ' school by mistake . " That 's a statement of fact . " Everybody 's having lots of fun . " The mistresses are
zone1	. I see what you mean . Well , we must institute a system of censorship at once . Yes , Miss Whitchurch . I advise you to take similar steps , Mr Pond . We have a bond of trust here at Nutbourne , ... the boys and I , which is never abused . Yes , Billings ? I caught young Sutton posting this . There 's nothing against the boys sending parcels home . What is it ? A fishcake . And Sutton 's father is an analytical chemist . There 's a note inside which reads , " Dear Dad , our breakfast . " Get weaving . Reg . " THUD Well , I suppose we all have black sheep . Want me to skim through the rest of the flock ? Yes . I suggest you get together with this lady . Hello , is that Mr Tripp ? Mr Tripp ! It is ? Good ... Mr Tripp ? Mr Pond . I take it Mr Arkwright has told you what Mr Bullock told him I told Mr Forrester ? Yes , I
zone1	think how it occurred . ... I would n't like to promise that . It 'll take a little while . You 're not an approved school , by any chance ? I 'll do everything I can to expedite matters . Good morning . FANFARE Will these little blighters never stop writing home ? I ca n't pass one in ten of these . No , nor can I . Still , you know , I do think it 's been heaps of fun working together . It has , has n't it ? Not my idea of fun , Miss Gossage . Call me Sausage . " That which we call a rose , by any other name would smell as sweet ... " Thank you , Betty . Does anyone know the Good Night passage ? I do , Miss Harper . Very well , Barbara . Where shall I start , Miss Harper ? From " Well , do not swear . " " Well , do not swear , although I ... " KNOCK ON DOOR Oh , do you think I might borrow another
zone1	. That 's the fifth in three days . As many as that ? The children will begin to misconstrue your intentions . Misconstrue ? One or two seem to be doing so already . Barbara , do n't stand staring , carry on . " I have no joy of this contract tonight ... It is too rash , too unadvised , too sudden ... Too like the lightning which doth cease to be ... " " E'er one can say , ' It lightens ' Sweet , good night ... This bud of love ... By summer 's ripening breath ... May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet . Good night , good night ! " DOOR OPENS Make it good morning and return to your class , Mr Tassell . Well , I ... I have n't got a class , Miss Whitchurch . Then do n't interrupt ours . I made it perfectly plain on the noticeboard that there was to be no interschool poodle-faking . And while I ... LAUGHTER Well , really ! The starboard engine had gone for a burton ,
zone1	the clock . So I just pressed on . You must have had a gorgeously exciting time of it . Oh ! I 'd simply have adored to see you in your uniform . Well , I looked much the same as the rest of the bunch . I say , you girls are bang-on for 17 . Mr Brown , what are you doing with my seniors ? I was just showing them the petunias . Jolly good display this year . A bit past their best , of course . Will you leave us this minute ? I was only giving them a few hints , facts of nature , nothing else . You girls get back to your indoor botany at once . I know it 's slightly distracting to have to work in the hall , but we must try and profit through adversity . We 'll choose a phrase at random , and let us see if we can analyse it . Morning , boys . Morning , miss Whitchurch . We 'll take a phrase ... Please , Mr Pond , ... ask your
zone1	And I think it advisable to alter the curriculum to cut out the biology classes . Let us analyse that excellent phrase of John Knox 's , " The first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women . " That 's enough . The verb in this case is understood . Like ... Like some other things . So we may take it that the sentence runs , " This IS the first blast of the trumpet . " et cetera , et cetera . This - the subject . Is - the verb . Everyone paying attention ? BOYS : Yes , sir . Very well . Talbot ! Sir . Take 100 lines . Yes , sir . How are we to deal with the rest of the ... ? What about the object ? Good morning . Good morning . Can any boy tell me what is the object ... I have called on behalf of Miss Winston ... ... in this particular case ? Whose bed is that and where are you taking it ? It belonged to the late cook , sir
zone1	. We 'll see about that . Take it to my study at once . I 'm sure Mr Pond will listen to reason if I can speak to him . He 's teaching , I tell you . You do n't seem to realise ... What is the object ? Up your end , Edwin . What is the object ... ? Mr Pond ... What 's the use ? I might as well try to teach in Waterloo station . There 's a lady at the door , sir , wanting to know if you 'll vote for miss Winston in the election . Mrs Hampstead , tell your lady that if there is a male candidate , whether he 's Conservative , socialist , communist or anarchist , ... or , for that matter , Liberal , ... he will have my vote . - That 's what I thought , sir . There is NO object in this at all , so let us take the word " trumpet " . It 's no use hanging back like that , Margaret . It 'll only be
zone1	ought to do with " trumpet " ? Margaret , you must n't think just because you 're in a school like this ... that you can behave as you please . I repeat - ... what do you propose we ought to do with " trumpet " ? Talbot , another hundred lines . CRASH Higher , I said higher ! Oh ! You wait here . Now , report to Miss Armstrong at once . CRASH All right , let us leave " trumpet " and think of " blast " . Blast , somebody ! BLAST , ANYBODY ! As a young man , I studied yogi for a brief period . It has enabled me to bear with fortitude this situation which otherwise I could never have endured . Poppycock ! Please let me finish . But yogi or no yogi , ... I am determined not to allow the situation to deteriorate further , ... if that were possible . Good afternoon , Mr Tripp . Mr Tripp , since you have apparently done nothing to rectify this state of affairs here , ... I
zone1	Forrester . I 'm not in the least concerned about an appointment . If Mr Forrester will not see me , I 'll speak to my MP . He 's probably playing golf . Matthews , will you ask Rainbow to get me a taxi , please ? Can I have a word , Miss Whitchurch ? What is it , Miss Jezzard ? This porter . He refuses to take orders from me . I just want to know where I stand . Every time I ask him to do anything , he says he 's too busy . She says I 'm to take the brake to the station , and Mr Hyde-Brown says I 'm to mark out the 2nd XV pitch . Now which is it to be ? Will you tell him or shall I ? Very well , sir , it 's all I want to know . Just a moment , Rainbow . I shall consider these requests entirely on their merits . That 's right , haver about . Why has the brake to go to the station ? To meet parents
zone1	. Ours ? Ridiculous . You invited them yourself . Mr and Mrs Parry , Mrs Jones , and Mr and Mrs Ibbertson . They were nervous about what sort of school this was , so you said they could come down and see for themselves . Why did n't you remind me ? We must stop it at once . Stopping the 3 o'clock will be too much even for you . It 's out of the question having the parents here with this man and his rabble around . It had occurred to me ... Nothing ever occurs to you or they would n't be coming . When they see we 're sharing a boys ' school , they 'll withdraw their children . Before we know where we are , we shall have no school left . That will solve the problem . This is no time for prep school repartee . Thinking caps . Thinking caps . I have it ! You must remove your boys for the afternoon . Remove my boys ? From my own school ? ! Mr Pond , for the past
zone1	fair measure of harmony ... Harmony ? ! With your shrieking progeny everywhere ! I 'm completely unmoved by your plight , madam . I do n't give a fig . Mr Matthews , Miss Jezzard , would you be good enough to wait outside ? And take the porter with you . There is talk in the common room that you are seeking an appointment as headmaster of Harlingham . What has that got to do with removing my boys ? I thought you might like to know that I 'm acquainted with one of the governors of that school . Oh , madam , I should not consider a recommendation from you an advantage . I was n't thinking of a recommendation . You were trying to coerce me with threats , madam ? The law takes a serious view of that . Have you the temerity to suggest that I 'm trying to blackmail you ? ! I shall merely make a factual report . I see . There appear to be no depths to which you are not prepared to sink . If you have nothing
zone1	Jezzard and Mr Matthews and lay our plans ? Run ! Run ! What on earth 's going on with the goalposts ? The school 's got to beat it to the swimming baths . What ? Some of the girls ' parents are visiting . There 's to be no sign that the shadow of man has crossed here . How long 's this to last ? Matinee performance only . Oh , look , there they are . Group dancing . Yeah . Two guineas extra . We know . Mrs Ibbertson is wearing that white hat she wore in the summer . This is no time for tittle-tattle . How do you do , Mrs Ibbertson ? So nice to see you . Miss Jezzard . ... How do you do , Mrs Jones ? A delightful spot . Yes . ... How do you do , Mr Parry ? How do you do ? Tea will be laid in the study . A gracious old hall , do n't you think ? Yes . Still it must be trying to share a school . We are
zone1	, of course . Is there any difference in class with the other school ? Not so much of class as of outlook . I think I 'll show you the dining hall first . I hope you do n't let the girls mix too much . Not if I can help it . This dining hall is a gem in its way . Of course , it 's rather a squeeze when they 're all here . But we stagger most of the meals . " Guard thine honour " ? The Nutbourne school motto . In my young day , such things were taken for granted . Well , the place goes back to Henry VIII . They tell me this part of the building used to be a barn before they rebuilt it . Well ... what about pottering upstairs ? I 'm sure a cup of tea would be welcome . It would indeed . And then to the fray like giants refreshed . Off we go . I understand Henry built it for Anne Boleyn , ... but she was beheaded before she could move
zone1	think ? Shall we see the other school ? They 've gone on an all-day ramble . I wish you could have seen us working in tandem . No , that 's the common room . What a snug retreat ! Yes , it is rather nice . A bit on the small side for our two staffs , but it serves . Looks out onto the grounds . May I ? Of course . Oh ! There 's nothing much to see , I 'm afraid . Quite an attractive view . Yes , is n't it ? They tell me you can see the sea on a clear day . ( **30;7180;TOOLONG . ) Nutbourne must be a rather unusual school . Surely they 're not in favour of blood sports ? Oh , I gather that was a present from somebody 's aunt . Just a minute . ... Excuse me . It 's that stupid village newsagent . I ordered The Lady , and he sent Men Only . Shall we be getting along to my study now ? What on earth are these doing here

I think that 's all . Telegram for Mr Pond . I thought it might be important . Better open it . I 'm second master . If anyone 's going to open it ... Oh , shut up . I say , this is the absolute penultimate . The governors of Harlingham are coming here today . But ... Here . He did say they were coming . But he could n't have known when . He 'll never be headmaster of Harlingham now . You do n't need a crystal to tell you that . He will remain here then . For life . You realise what that means ? What are we to do ? We must put the school back and get Pond back . What time is his train ? 3.15 . 10 minutes . Get rid of the girls , I 'll go to the station
zone1	. I thought you might not have received our telegram . Dr Collet wanted it to be a surprise visit , but I told him that would not be fair . Just did n't want anything specially laid on . I wanted to see the school in normal conditions . So would I . Yes , so would I . So you shall . Well , well , well , how do you do , gentlemen ? Welcome to Nutbourne . Just that your telegram scarcely left me enough time to make the necessary arrangements for your ... reception . Will you excuse me one moment while I see what 's happened to the taxi ? Thank heavens you 're still here . Gentlemen . ( MrBillings , **25;7212;TOOLONG ... ) Gentlemen , this is Mr Billings , my maths master . He very thoughtfully brought the school brake along . ... Thank you . That 's all right , sir . It was not our intention to disrupt the school work . On the contrary . I ca n't imagine Mr Billings has left the boys without problems to
zone1	. I imagine they 'll take a while to clear them up . Yes . No doubt . Well , there 's no hurry . We want to catch the last train back , Mr Pond . Beautiful country round here , is n't it ? Yes , but as I said , we want to catch the last train back . You can do that but there 's plenty of time to spare . I do love this part of the country . Delightful . Which ... way are you going , Billings ? Through Fairhurst and Upper Dudley and Lower Dudley and Braxton . The short way . That 's right , Billings , the short way . I ask no more for youth than space and air and freedom from distraction . I 'm glad to hear that , Miss Whitchurch . Cynthia has reached the difficult age . Angela 's just the same . I 'm sure Miss Whitchurch grasps the dangers of adolescence . Firmly , in both hands , if I may say so . TELEPHONE RINGS Shall I answer it ? Please do
zone1	, it is possible to ... to ... climb to its topmost branches ... What ? A Mr Hartley of the Ministry . Tell him we 'll ring him back in an hour . I wonder if you 'd mind if we rang back . You see ... I beg your pardon ? Just wondering how we 're settling down , I expect . Now , let me see ... where were we ? Uh ... Oh , yes ! It is possible to climb to its topmost branches and select the fruit where we will . Are you sure you ca n't ? Oh , dear . I said we 'd ring him back . He 's going out . He wants to know if we 're still in trouble . I have n't the remotest idea what he 's talking about . We 're perfectly happy . No , we 're all right , thank you very much . Good afternoon . Where was I ? Up the tree . Oh , yes ! Well , I do think it 's a jolly rotten show . Not a
zone1	, it 's not fair . Now look ... ! Where are you going with our goalposts ? Honestly ! I thought you said the school was a mere five minutes from the station . In terms of jet propulsion ( ! ) It said Nutbourne down there . We 've a first-class rugger team at Harlingham . What shape 's yours in ? It varies . Very pleasant outlook here . Uninterrupted too , the estate agents say . Mr Tassell , I 'm all for team spirit and I do n't want to rock the boat , but I ca n't keep my girls cooped up here all afternoon . Well , just hold on a minute . Ah , Matthews . This is Mr Matthews , my most able second-in-command . Mr Angus McNally , Dr Collet ... How do you do , sir ? ... and Reverend James Rich . Well , gentlemen , shall we go inside ? Here we are . This is the oldest part of the school . It goes back to Henry VIII . Anyone in the dining hall ? No
zone1	show it to these gentlemen . Matthews and I will see about refreshment . After you , gentlemen . What happened ? I 'm sorry , sir . We did what we could in the time . We got the girls out the playing field . Where are the rest of them ? Still here , I 'm afraid . Miss Whitchurch is having tea with the parents in her study . HER study ? YOUR study , sir . She wo n't be for long . There 's simply no holding Byron at lacrosse this term , so Tennyson and Shelley are going to stop the rot . When you 've finished your tea , we 'll see how the battle is faring . The sun 's very gay this afternoon . Another cup of tea , Mr Ibbertson ? Miss Whitchurch , I must speak to you at once . Oh , Doctor , if it 's about that little protuberance on Cecilia Watson 's neck , I 'll see you in the common room . If you do n't mind , Doctor . Excuse me , wo
zone1	. How dare you burst in there , jeopardising my position in that reckless fashion ? I do n't care what you have to say . Do I have to remind you about the governors of Harlingham ? No . They are in the dining hall , here to see the school . They 've shut Shelley , Tennyson and Byron in the pav . Shut your other brats with them , I 'm bringing my boys back from the swimming pool at once . Quiet . My parents will hear you . Your parents can go and ... Mr Pond ! I do n't want the whole building involved in the brouhaha . We 'll thrash this out in the common room . 1931 was a vintage year , as you see . Three scholarships to Oxford , two to Cambridge . Before Pond , I imagine . It 's no use brandishing governors . One look at what 's going on , and my chances of Harlingham are ruined . I 'll have to establish myself as a victim of circumstances . Ramsden , tell Mr Matthews to
zone1	once . So that 's where they are . My mind is made up on one thing , Miss Whitchurch . If I sink , you sink with me . Do n't act as if next week will do , man ! Wait ! Why should we sink , Mr Pond ? If we keep our wits , we can still come through with flying colours . Let us examine this problem calmly . Miss Whitchurch , the governors are in the dining hall . And my parents are in the study . Both parties wish to tour the school . Very well , so they shall . But never the twain shall meet . What will happen when the governors meet a swarm on girls ? They must n't . The governors must only see boys , the parents girls . We 'll have two conducted tours going clockwise or anticlockwise , as the case may be . It 's no use being lily-livered . If one party leaves five minutes after the other , ... we 'll have time to interchange classes . It 'll have to be
zone1	same course . If you want my opinion , the whole thing 's imposs . We do n't want your opinion . Thank you , Miss Gossage . Every single boy and girl would have to co-operate . Yes . That would mean Doris , Cynthia and Pamela deceiving their parents . A half holiday will cure that . Where 's your child psychology ? That 's not the school spirit . Do n't talk to mr . Pond like that , Gossage . Thank you , miss Whitchurch . Kindly leave these arrangements to us . What exactly do you envisage , miss Whitchurch ? Well , if I take my parents to see the school museum , ... while you bring your governors to tea in the study , ... that will give us time to set the stage . Yes . Now , let us swiftly plot the itinerary . Please , allow me . Thank you , Mr Pond . Now , this must be very exactly timed . Shall we first synchronise our watches ? Excellent . I 'm not a complaining man , Maude
zone1	annual job that I do n't look forward to , ... but today we 've had ' em up , taken ' em down and had ' em up again ! Now you 've to take them down again . Tea for four in the study , Mrs Hampstead . I think everyone 's gone absolutely batty . The governors of Harlingham have arrived . What ? But ... Do n't argue , get the boys back to school . BLOWS WHISTLE We 'll just have a quick cup , then start on our travels . Priscilla Johnson was romping in a haystack when that Bastard Purple alighted on her . She had him in the killing bottle in a flash . Here they come , girls . Onto the field again . Buck up ! Hurrah ! Well , I think that exhausts the butterflies . Shall we start out tour of the classrooms ? It 's always been my view that too much ... WHISTLE BLOWS Is that a rugby game ? No . Short blast . Too much concentration on examinations makes boys sluggish . Good afternoon
zone1	, Miss Harper . Good afternoon , Miss Whitchurch . This is the sixth form . They 're taking French history . It 'll be Louis XIII . There 's Angela . Could we have a word with Angela ? If you wish . Angela Parry , you may fall out . Hello , Mumsy . Hello , Pop . Hello , Angela . It 's good to see you . Your parents want to know how you like the school , ... but do n't commit yourself unless you 've made up your mind . Oh , I have . I think it 's an absolute scorcher ! I never dreamt ... How 's your history progressing , Angela ? She 's always been weak on dates . Not this term , Pop . What are you up to at the moment , Angela ? Oh , nothing , Mumsy . If they 've been telling you about Archie Brown ... Archie ... Archibald Brown , in case you did n't know , ... was the man who held the torch for Guy Fawkes . I 've been running
zone1	Get back to your class now , Angela . Say goodbye to your parents . Bye , Mumsy . Bye , Pop . Goodbye , dear . Goodbye , Angela . That 's right . Come along , everybody . Such a charming child . A great favourite with the other girls . A pity she 's leaving this term . Oh , to the right now , Mrs Ibbertson . OK . All clear . Away with the first party . Right , move one pace forward . March . Now , at the double . Surely they 'll find out about this . - Ours is not to reason why . If they do , we 'll have to find fresh posts tomorrow . We 'll have to apply for a job at a progressive school where the kids throw inkpots ! It 'll be a rest after this . That must be the start of the game . No , no , no , no , three , three short blasts for that . Well now , gentlemen , if you 're finished with your tea ,
zone1	Now we 're going to see the miming class . They 're doing the death of Charles I . The one with the crown is the king . Could n't we go in and watch ? Well , perhaps for a few minutes . But no talking . It 's an iron rule with the miming class . Good afternoon , boys . Good afternoon , Mr Tassell . Sit down , boys . Gentlemen , they 're taking English . Carry on , Mr Tassell . As I was saying , a mixed metaphor is an expression in which two or three metaphors are confused . Could the boys give an example ? I 'd like to see what they know . Certainly . Metcalf , would you give us an example of a mixed metaphor ? Playing with fire . Skating on thin ice . And if anything happens to upset the applecart , ... someone is going to lose his bread and butter . Very good , Metcalf . Sit down . They seem quite bright . Yes . That satisfies me . Shall we move on
zone1	little onomatopoeia ? They 're good at onomatopoeia . What did you say your name was ? Metcalf , sir . Metcalf . To your right , gentlemen , to your right . Down , girls , away you go . Come along , Jennifer , no loitering . The school curriculum , I 'll explain it quite briefly . We do n't want to know about the curriculum . We want a picture of the way the school is running . Who on earth was that ? Little Lucy , the housekeeper 's daughter . The rascal 's not allowed upstairs . I 'll have to speak to Mrs Hampstead . Gentlemen , shall we make history ? It 's a maze of corridors around here . This way , if you please . Round the corner . We 'll have to hurry to see the dressmaking class before break . The middle third are leading the school with their underwear this term . The upper fifth are taking William of Orange . We need n't bother with that . I do n't think so . Not William of
zone1	you shall . We 've got to see other things first . They skipped the upper fifth . They 're catching up . Run ! Quite an impressive collection of nether garments , Miss Curtis . I think we 'd better pass on now . I do n't want you to miss the choir 's rendering of Nymphs And Shepherds , Come Away . Thank you , Miss Curtis . Come along , or we shall be too late . Edward , please , you simply must look at these etchings . This particular one ... Very interesting , I 'm sure , ... but hardly what we came to see . Where do we go from here ? Oh , let me see . Yes , I think we might risk a little theoretical physics . BOYS LAUGH AND GIGGLE Quiet , boys , quiet . Get that stuff out of sight . We seem to be doing a lot of padding round , do n't we ? Oh , how stupid of me ! The physics class is first right and first right again . 15 years here
zone1	They 've gone down the wrong corridor . Gosh , that 's torn it ! Nymphs And Shepherds should be accompanied by a recorder and a harpsichord . What is it , dear ? They 've gone the wrong way . Do n't bother me now , Alice . Unpick it and start again . She 's such a panicky child . She never manages blackberry stitches . Oh , we 've plenty of cupboard accommodation . Oh , I should have known they were there . I 'm so sorry . A mistake at the sports shop . They sent the wrong sort . This is indeed circumambulation . Pack them all in , Helen . Oh , we 're almost there , gentlemen . Good heavens ! Who did that ? That reminds me . I 'm afraid it would . All in good time , Doctor . I 'll inquire into this later . Now ... Good afternoon , boys . Sit down . Mr Ramsden . This is the middle fifth . They 're fairly advanced with their physics , I 'm happy to say .

Have you the faintest idea what 's going on ? No , dear . BELLS RING , HOOTERS BLARE I have a brother who grows groundnuts in Tanganyika .

zone1	3557993 Onceuponatime there was a little house on a little hill , way out in the country . She was a happy little house , for she loved the country life . The peace and quiet . The warm sun on her roof . And the whisper of the summer breeze round her eaves . As time passed by the little house was blessed with new additions and distractions . But little pains , even broken one's , are soon forgotten . It was only at night that the little house felt just a little bit lonely , and wondered what it would be like to have other houses around to talk to . Then she would gaze wistfully toward the distant lights of the city , never realizing that all the time those lights were coming closer and closer . " Gracious me , " thought the little house . - " What perfectly elegant neighbors . - Why , I 'm right in the very center of the social world . " " Landsakes , I was only trying to be neighborly . " Help ! Help ! Help ! The alarm ! Sound the alarm ! "
zone1	" What a pity . Still , they were n't very nice . " The years rolled faster now , and the little house saw the dawn of a new century . The tempo of life had quickened . Everything was bigger and better , for this was the Age of Progress . " Well , do tell . Here I am , completely surrounded by progress . " Oh , shut up . Say , who are you tellin ' to shut up ? Quiet ! Oh , yeah ? Try that on your saxophone . - I say so . - Go on , you big ... " IfonlyIcouldgo with them , " thought the house . But , of course , she could n't . Come what may , she had to stand her ground . #Shouldauld acquaintance be forgot # And days of auld lang syne # Happy New Year ! Butthelittlehousefelt that she could never be happy again .

Or feel the gentle touch of the summer breeze ? Or hear the song of the meadowlark ? " Extra , extra ! Poorforgottenlittlehouse . There was nothing left now . Not even hope . - There she is , boys . - That old shack ? - Yeah . - OK . Let 's get it over with . " Yes , getit overwith . I 'm just in the way . No good to anybody . But landsakes , I should n't complain . I 've had a very full life for a house . We all have to go sometime . " It was n't the end , after all . It was just the beginning . Oh , it took a little time and a lot of fixing , but all that mattered was that she 'd found someone . Or rather , they 'd

Going to be able to spend much time with us , dear ? Oh , I intend to , mother . Would you mind stopping , letting me off at teachers college , father ? I wo n't be long , mother . I 've been expecting that . Ca n't wait to see old , uh , Professor , uh , toosis , can ya ? Ca n't even remember his name . I just want to pay my respects and get his advice on a talk I 'm giving to the graduating class at my old Alma mater . Why , John , what an honor . Could we be there ? We 'd be so proud , would n't we ? Mmhmm . Well , it 's an awfully long trip , mother , and time is so short . I 'll send you the speech and you and
zone1	Uh , take a left at the next corner , father . Do you know that you can fly 500 Miles in 2 hours ? We could fly and hear John . How ' bout surprising him , Dan ? Fly ? You and I ? Everybody flies nowadays . We ought a keep up with the times . Dr . carver said I should be nice to you , did n't he ? Mmhmm . Would n't cost too much , would it ? Oh , I should say not . I hear some irishman advertising on the radio every day . ? You can fly any place in the United States ? ? diddle-diddle-Dee- diddly-diddly-doo ? ? and travel by air is much cheaper , too ? ? phone wasuch too-ra-loo-ra-loo ? ? I 'll do it for you . But he did n't invite us . We 're lowbrow . He 'll probably invite his highbrow Professor . But he can have his highbrow professors , ' cause if he prefers the ... what 's the matter with ya ? I might ask you the same thing
zone1	your breaks bad ? I just had ' em fixed . You stopped . I did n't stop , I just slowed down . I had to see what street this was . Well , you must be a stranger around here . Yeah , yeah ... I do n't care where you 're from , they do n't drive like that . Well , we do n't have to get in a big hassle about it . You just bent my Fender a little bit there . Well , here 's my driver 's license right there and here 's my insurance card . We do n't need to go into all that . Oh , yes , we do . You drive like an idiot . Well , I guess she 's right . That 's my little wife . How do you do ? Well , uh , no hard feelings . No hard feelings . We 'll just forget all about it , huh ? Mother , you should n't have waited up ! Wanted to . But I asked dad specifically to tell you to
zone1	, it 's kind of like old times . Waiting up for me to come home , is n't it ? I had a little work to do anyway . Now , come on in . Come on in , son . There 's your ... your old chair . Sit down , sit down . Take the load off your feet . Yes . Remember how you used to sit there reading all night long and I 'd come down in the morning and find you sound asleep . We still have some of your old books . Oh , mother , I 'm terribly sorry about dinner , but when the Professor and I get together , you know , I have n't seen him in a year . You have n't seen us either . He means that we 've just been dying to talk to you , too . Why do n't you talk to your father for a little while ? I have some ... I 'll be back in a minute . Oh , you 're wonderful , mother . Too bad that ,
zone1	Ben and Chuck off . Those two are a riot . Yes , mother wrote me all about it , father . Oh , she did , huh ? Well , did she tell you about Chuck ? Mmhmm . Eight pages , both sides . What 's the matter with you , son ? I mean , you seem nervous about something . Is something bothering ya ? Feel fine . Maybe a little tired . Well , why do n't you go on up to bed now and go to sleep ? We can talk anytime . Let 's talk . I 'm looking forward to talking to you , father . Talk , talk . You know me , John . All I know is what I read in the papers . In the local papers , huh ? Well , our local paper 's not so bad . Our editor pulls off many a witticism . I 'm sure , father . You just thought of one ? Yeah . Yes , he had a ... he had a good one in there yesterday about a
zone1	he steals the ... he steals the results of next year 's election . You know , every day he puts one of those in a little box . In a little box . Did I miss out on something ? Oh , mother . Father still has his sense of humor . You still teaching at the little red schoolhouse , father ? Oh , yes , yes . Still teaching them the same down to earth ... - fundamentals . - That 's right . - Dan 's been - working on his speech for the legion . He 's running for commander of the post . Maybe he could help you with it , huh ? - Who ? - John . Well , I 'd love to , father . You know , add some little colorful touches . Put some bows on it . Why do I want some bows on it for ? Oh , well , father , she does n't mean that . I think mother means that maybe you 'd like to take advantage of your investment in me . What
zone1	? Uh , my subject is , " where are we headed ? " Hm , well , where are we headed , father ? That 's what I 'd like to know , son . Well , how can you tell them what you 'd like to know ? I 've got it . You 've got what ? What do you mean ? That 's what I 'd like to know is what you mean , father . Where are we headed ? I know where we 're headed . Well , good . So far , you have n't said anything yet that 's gon na get you any votes . But do n't worry , I 've got it . It 's all here , it 's packed with dynamite . Well , it sure is loud . Well , it might be loud , yes . You ought a come over , it 'd do ya good . Here 's some of the singing that we do at the finish because we 've got one particular song that I 'd love to walk into a
zone1	full blast . ? If you do n't like your Uncle Sammy ? ? then go back to your home o'er the sea ? ? to the land from whence you came ? ? no matter what its name ? ? but do n't be ungrateful to me ? ? if you do n't like the stars in old glory ? ? if you do n't like the red , white , and blue ? ? then do n't act like the cur in the story ? ? do n't bite the hand that 's feeding you ? ? Oh , father . Rousing words . Great , father . Oh , I 'll read your speech . Oh , gosh , I 've got to learn this . We 've got ta do it together . ? If you do n't like your Uncle Sammy ? ? then go back to the land o'er the sea ? ? I did n't get your name , go back from where you came ? ? and do n't be ungrateful to me ? ? Mother ! I thought you might like
zone1	that . I thought you might get hungry , stranger . You still eat , do n't you ? You 're working on father 's speech ? Mmhmm . Making a few suggestions . Good . I want to talk to you . Tell me all about yourself , tell me about everything . Ca n't we talk just a little bit , like old times . Of course , mother , why not ? I do n't know . But somehow I just have a feeling that we 're not as close this time as we always were . What 's happened to my boy ? Well , he 's grown up , mother . Boys do grow up , you know ? You 're aware of the silver cord , mother . It must be severed , you know . Yes , I was there at the time . Oh , John , let 's you and me talk sense . Silver cord , fiddle-Dee-Dee . I ... I do n't want to intrude , but we do n't have to be strangers either , do we ?
zone1	Have you got a girl ? Well , sentimentalizing over the biological urge is n't really a guarantee of human happiness , dear . Ah . Now you 've got me as mixed up as you had your father . Oh , and speaking of ... you were rude to your father tonight , John . No , I think you 're wrong . Oh , no , I know your face , John . I 've looked into it too many years not to know it . I know every line . Every curve of that mouth . Been stealing any pennies lately ? You 're not going back that far , are you ? You have n't forgotten ! Oh , no . Oh , how everybody thought you were so sick when you did n't go to school . I knew what was bothering you . I brought you right into this room , did n't I ? - Right here . - Yes and I said , " it 's all right , John , I was saving them for you anyway . " And then
zone1	sudden you were n't sick anymore . You 've got to begin to accept the fact that I 'm no longer a baby . You 've got to get used to the idea . You were the gurglingest baby . Well , there you go again . Ah , I used to put you on my knee and bounce you up and down . Up and down . Teedle-deedle dumplin ' my son John went to bed with his stockings on . One shoe off and one shoe on , teedle-deedle dumplin ' my son John . And you said , " do it again , mommy , do it again , mommy . " Teedle-deedle dumplin ' my son John went to bed ... I got tired on this knee , and I put you on this knee . Teedle-deedle dumplin ' my son John went to bed with his stockings ... you used to wear me out . Do it again , mother . You 're joking . No , I 'm not . Yes , you are . Oh , I can ... Well , that 's
zone1	to your father . - Oh , mother . - Oh , no . I do n't understand . No , John . Not with me . It 's me . You remember me ? Oh ... When it gets to the stage where you 're making fun of a mother 's love ... oh , no , mother . II ... I guess I 'm just like all the other mothers . I ca n't take it . Making fun of my lullaby . Spoiling my memories . Oh , but I did n't mean it , mother . Oh , yes , you did . With all my heart , I did n't . Well , then do n't ... do n't act " like the cur in the story . " ? Do n't bite the hand that 's feeding you ? You 're laughing . I made you ... well , you can still do that , ca n't you ? Well , if it takes my tears to make you laugh , that 's all right , I do n't care . Well , if
zone1	Fender . That 's right . Did you come to laugh about it ? Well , no , I , uh , the , uh ... I was playing cowboy and Indians with the neighbor 's child and trying to do my work at the same time . What do you want ? Oh , oh , well , it 's about that , um , the ... the bent Fender , you know ? It came to a little more than I expected . It , uh , was , um , $18 ... do n't choke over it . No , I 'm not ... and 70 odd cents . I see , that 's why you 're here . Well , you know , after all , $18 is $18 . Oh , I know , I know , with taxes the way they are . Well , yes , you have to , uh , make a lot more than ... Well . Your attitude 's a little different from what it was yesterday . Well , yesterday , I did n't ... well , yesterday
zone1	" Well , I , uh ... Would pick a time when my husband was n't here . What makes you presume that it was our fault ? Well , I think that 's a rather natural presumption . Oh , yes , Sunday Christian , huh ? Well , I ... I mean , I 'm just drivin ' along minding my business when , boom , it 's a crash and I look back and then at you . Whose fault do you think that was ? Why did n't you look where you were going ? Look ? You hit me from behind . After all , I have n't got eyes in my rear . No ? Well , I ... I mean , I , you know , I ca n't ... I ca n't see what 's in back of me . I thought that 's what you meant . You meet some peculiar people nowadays . A lot of pettiness in the world , do n't you think so ? Lady , there 's nothing petty about $18 . It was the 70
zone1	? I do n't think we hit anybody else yesterday . Hope you did n't have any trouble at the front door . Well , no , that , um , that was a present from my two sons . They 're in the service . Yes , they were here last week . We had a sort of , um , farewell dinner . Well , I ... oh , but pardon me , you want to fight the battle of 18.70 , what is it ? It does seem a little silly to squabble about a repair bill when boys like yours are ... oh , you 've got another side . Yeah . Maybe you 'd like to squabble over a cup of coffee . Yeah , I 'd like that . Come in . Bring the bill . I got it . That 's what my boys sent me . Well , that 's ... that 's beautiful . I 'm just dying to try it on . Why do n't you ? I think I will . That 's nice . Mmhmm . Madame butterfly
zone1	about as sad as poor butterfly . It 's , uh , it 's only that this was sent from San Francisco . That 's a harbor , is n't it ? That 's where ships sail from ? Yeah . Well , that was a welcome interruption . Yes ? Cleaner . Yes , it is . Where 's Mrs . Jefferson ? Oh , she 's , uh , on the phone . I 'll take it . Yes ? No , he is n't here now . Who is calling , please ? Uh-huh . Would n't you think people would leave their names ? These are my two boys . The one's that , uh ... yeah . Look like a great pair of halfbacks . Yes . This one used to pass to that one . Yes , he 'd fade way back . Oh , yeah , to give him a chance to get down the field . Uhhuh . And then ... Boom , touchdown . You have two fine boys , all right . Oh , we have another son , John
zone1	He has more degrees than a thermometer . I said there was only one bright one in the family . He 's brilliant though , really . He 's going to give the commencement address at his university . Oh , that John Jefferson . Well , he is ... he 's just famous , that 's all . He does n't know it , but his father and I are going to be there to hear him . Oh , that 's wonderful . Well , I may be there myself . That 's my Alma mater , too . - Oh ? - Mm-hmm . Well , uh , does ... he does n't live here with you now then . No , he 's just visiting . He 's in Washington . That phone call , that was for him . Oh . That was long distance from Washington . He has a great career ahead of him . Well , it seems you have three fine sons , Mrs . Jefferson . Mmhmm . God was good to me . Oh , I do n't know
zone1	, too . You 're a wonderful mother . Is your mother still living ? I have a wonderful mother , too . Nothing petty about her . Oh , you should n't have done that . You never would have got it anyway . Mother ? Yes , John ? Hi . Oh , you said you 'd be home early . Have a good day ? Mm , fine . Well , my day was ... little lonely ? Oh , I 'm sorry , mother . I promise that I 'll see more of you . You do , John . You had a long distance phone call from Washington , D.C . Oh . Uh , who was it ? They did n't leave any name . What did he , um , did he leave any message ? It was a girl , John . You 've got a girl , John ? Oh , no , mother , it was probably just a routine call from the office . No , it was a payphone . I heard her drop a lot of money
zone1	'd call back later . Mmhmm . Where 's father ? He 's , uh , going over your notes . Oh . Well , I hope I was of some help on his speech . Well , uh , he did n't say ... John ? Father . How 's your supper coming ? Oh , fine . Well , I 'm sorry that I missed you this morning , father . Well , it was as much my fault as yours , son . I ate in haste , I had to leave . Well , uh , did you find my notes useful ? That 's what I wanted to talk to you about , John . I hope you got my points , father , because I did n't want you to be saying things that you did n't mean . Now , you know , I realize as well as you that the legion is a great force for good and caution must be shown to avoid the danger of a misuse of their power . Well , do n't you think fighting men can
zone1	? Oh , father . Well , then what happened to my first line ? We legionnaires must fight to keep the power in the people and if we let the state give us freedom , it also has the power to take it away . You , uh , you did n't find any substitute for that , you just , uh , marked that out with a blue pencil . Put your line back . Darn right I will . Put the wholespeech back , it 's all right with me . That 's what_i intend to do . I said , " when the state denies God given rights and regards itself as a source of liberty , freedom is doomed . " That is n't even your idea , is it ? No , I copied it . What difference does that make ? Copying it does n't make it right . I copied it right . Just wait there . John . Oh , father , let 's not go into it anymore . No , I 've ... I 've got another subject for
zone1	going to have a talk . A good talk , away from your mother , and it 's about you , son . Well , if you 'd enjoy it , father . Well , I do n't know whether you will . As I told you , we 're alert and we are alert . You just said that . Yes . And you sound to me like one of those guys that we should be alert about . One of those guys , father ? I just said that you sounded like one , I did n't say that you ... ' cause if I thought that you really were , you know , I 'd take you out in the backyard and I 'd give it to ya both barrels . No trial , huh ? Nah , you 're off on the wrong slant . And you know what I 'm talking about ' cause as your father , I wan na know where you 're at it . Well , I can help you there . I 'm headed for the bathroom . Wash my
zone1	'll go with you . Yes ? Yes , it is . Yes , he 's here now . Just a moment . Thanks , mom . Hello ? Yes . Uh , lu , I 'm sorry , but I 'm going on down to the legion now . Well , what about supper ? I 'll eat something when I get home . Oh , but you must have a bite . Well , I 'm not hungry . Oh , I 'll hurry it up . Now , look , the meeting is n't till 8:00 . You have two whole hours . Well , it 'll take me two hours to get my speech back the way it was . All right , see you later , son . Good luck , Dan . Thanks , I can use it . I can hear ya now . Yes . Yes . I heard you . I heard ... yes , goodbye . Oh , I ... I ... I know how you feel , mother . Do you ? I do n't understand father 's attitude
zone1	father . With a son like me ? You look worried , John . What , was it that phone call that did it ? Well , it was important , yes , mother , but , well , do n't , uh , let 's not go into how I look again . All right . I ... I made ... I made a cocktail in case anybody was in the mood . Good , let 's keep it bright . I made enough for three , but ... you know , I ... I do n't like to get back to father again , mother , but ... if you did n't , I would . He 's so troubled , John . You know , when we left you off at the university ... Yes ? Well , um , he was so mad that you 'd rather talk to highbrow professors that he smashed right into another car . Oh , he did ? Was it father 's fault ? Well , he claimed that the other fella stopped too fast . Well , what did
zone1	Man came by here today with his bill , but I talked him out of it . He finally tore it up . Oh , he finally tore it up . Well , um , did you ... did you have to do a lot of talking ? Oh , I certainly did . He was downright ornery at first . Well , I turned him into a nice fella . You know , warmed him up with some coffee . Well , you two had quite a chat . Yes , we had quite a chat . I told him about Ben and Chuck , what great athl ... about this fellow , uh , did he ... I was talking about your brothers . You keep wanting to talk about this fella . What 's the matter , John ? Does it bother you that I talk too much to strangers ? Oh , no ! It 's just that , well , it does seem odd that the fellow would come all of this way merely to tear up his bill . Yes . It is a
zone1	meant . Maybe . Now I 'm bothered . I told him about you . He seemed very interested . You know me , John , when I get started about you . Oh , yes , mother . Did you , uh , did you start when I was a boy with a penny jar ? No . I did ... Quite a lot of talking though . Here it is , John . - Hm ? - Remember ? Yes . Oh , my pills , I forgot . What are they for , mother ? Modern science has pills for women of my age , John . For , uh , people who forget where they put ' em . They 're supposed to insure us against going goofy . Goof insurance . Oh . I told Dr . carver that I 'd just as soon put my faith in God and what he intended . I 'd go along with science , too , mother , and take those little tablets . What about Moses and the tablets he left us ? With the prescription written
zone1	n't need any pills . No . I always got my strength from two books , both very nourishing in their own way . The cookbook and the Bible . Remember how I used to trick you into learning this one with this one . I 'd say to you , " I 'll make you , um , cookies , pies , cakes , and jam , if you 'll learn Matthew , mark , Luke , and John . " We had a kind of a deal , remember ? Mmhmm . John , what is the matter with you ? Oh , mother , I 've got more important things on my mind than cakes and cookies . And Luke and John . I , um , I 've got to make a phone call , mother . Lehigh 2-4-1-1 , please . I 'm sorry , mother . Um , what time is your next plane for New York ? Not until 12 ? Yeah , I know , but I 've got to get there right away . I mean , I 've got to
zone1	father . I 'm sorry to be popping in on you at this hour , but you heard my announcement about the clothing drive . Oh , my bundle is n't ready yet , father . Oh , I have a lot of things for you , especially now since Ben and Chuck are gone , but I have to go clear up in the attic to get them . Will tomorrow be all right ? Well , I suppose it 'll have to be . I 've been thinking about that joke that was told me Sunday . You know , the one about everybody helping me in this world and then trying to find me in the next . The joke has questionable merit and if John thinks what I ... he 's on the phone . Oh , hello , John ! Hi , father . I 'm doing a little work for the poor . John ? What ? I 'm trying to help out a few people in this world , too . - Goodnight , father . - Goodnight . Well , I know
zone1	got the car and ... well , then how much further is that from your field ? Damn . All right , yes . Bye . Come in . Mother ? All packed ? Yes . I wish I could leave with you feeling better . You could . I 'm all right . I listened , John , when your father was saying some awful things to you . Oh , well , that 's terrible , mother . No wonder you were so upset . I still am . Well , do n't let father poison your thinking . I 'm sure that I can clear this up in your mind . Do , John . Father is muddled , mother . He thinks in the past . The world at this point is in a turmoil and muddled thinking like father 's certainly is n't going to help . Young thinkers are dreaming of the future , mother , what 's ahead of us . Why not ? Go ahead . Our only hope is to learn to live with our fellow man . The globe is
zone1	each other . We must tear down our spite fences and learn to live with our neighbors . That 's good , John . Tear down our spite fences , love thy neighbor . Go on , I go along with you so far . Good . Now father thinks ... what do you think ? I love humanity , mother . I love the downtrodden , the helpless minorities . Good , John . That 's what I tried to teach you . You know by heart that we must labor to help the weak , like Saint Paul said . No one can tell me that an early religious training does n't show itself . Good . I know everything that you stand for , mother , and what I 'm striving for is an intelligent and practical way to bring into existence a new and better ordered world . Wewe did understand each other , did n't we ? Yes . Remember how I pleaded for your education ? How they teased me that you were my favorite . You 're part of me and it 's
zone1	would be a part of you . I had dreams myself , John , of great things to be done . But a wife and mother does n't have much time for more than put off till tomorrow . I ... I hoped , John , that ... You 'd see that someday my tomorrows would come through , some of them . We talk the same language and we think the same way . Of course we do . But , now , try to understand me . Everything that we agree on , you and I , I warn you , this is liberal thinking . So what ? If we think this way , we 're leftists , communists , subversive . That 's ridiculous . Well , of course it is , but that 's the way father thinks . Oh , he does n't mean that . Aw , I know , mother . Father 's wonderful . And I 'd do anything to convince him that he 's so wrong about me . Well , just tell him what you told me , John
zone1	through his head . I ... I want to prove once and for all how ridiculous his suspicions are . I 'd go to any lengths , mother , for your sake . I would swear on a stack of bibles . You would ? Well , it 's just an expression . But so expressive . That 'll do it . Oh , I 'm beginning to feel better already . You know how religious your father is , wait till we tell him . Go ahead . Oh , mother . Go ahead . How does it go ? Oh , mother . I swear that I am not now or ever have been a member of the communist party . Feel better ? I ca n't wait for your father to come home . I 'm a little relieved myself . You ca n't blame me now . Well , you really were worried , mother . Well , it alarmed me , you know ? You kept talking about this fellow with a silly bill . I thought it had something to do with you .
zone1	me ? I do n't know . I mean , I did n't ... you mean my telephone conversation , my having to leave suddenly has got something to do with this man in the ... yes , yes , yes . Oh , mother , I 'm ashamed of you . I 'm ashamed . Well , you see , that just shows you what one remark like father 's can do . Oh , I 'd hate to tell you what I was thinking . Your brain was racing , huh ? Was it . Well , now , you ... you get out of here . I 'm going to get dressed and I 'm going to get you something to eat . Oh , mother , no , I 'm not hungry . Anyway , I should be calling my cab , you know ? Oh . Well , meeting broke up early ? No , no , I left early . What are you up to ? Well , I was just calling a cab , father . I have to leave suddenly . Oh
zone1	visit , was it ? Did what I had to say in there cause you to ... oh , no , no , father . How was your speech ? Eh , you know that crowd . They , uh , they 're not too bright . They applauded me . Where 's your mother ? She 'll be down in a minute . Will you and I have time to finish our talk ? It 'll have to be brief , father , because my cab is on the way . Well , it can be . And if you wo n't remember where you were , I know where I was . It 's your turn to talk , so think over what you 're gon na say and I 'll see how your mother is . Well , John , I ... Hm . Mm-hmm . Hm . This , uh , this is the Bible that your mother taught ... forgive me , son , if I look a little fuddled ... well , that 's all right , father . Your mother just told me
zone1	together . She told me that she 'd heard us . Or heard you , father . Well , anyway , she believes in you . You 've made her very happy , son , and I 'm glad because I 've tried to make things pleasant for her . Dr . carver , he told me ... father , try a little harder , will you ? Because you brought this on by leaping to the accusation ... no , I never accused you . Oh , yes , you did , father . No , I just said that you ... that you talk like a scummy . Uhhuh and mother heard it , so now she 's upset . Well , anyway , I hope that this settles the whole thing . I mean , I ca n't do any more than swear on mother 's Bible , so I hope that we can now forget everything that 's happened , huh ? I hope so , yes . But , if you were , uh ... yes , father , go ahead . What ? Well
zone1	mean a thing , would it , huh ? A whole stack of bibles . Well , there you go again . I know , I know . Father , open your mind and let this in , will you ? The church , they 'd believe me . The courts , they 'd believe me . Mother believes me , but you do n't . Mmmm , not yet . Do you believe in the Bible ? Well , now , father , do you believe every page ? I mean Jonah and the whale ... I believe every page , son . Jonah and the whale ... even the pages you do n't understand . I believe in those , too . That 's faith . That certainly is , father . You mean you believe in heaven and hell 's fire ... I sure as there 's a hell do . Listen , son , take the first commandment . Do you believe in the lord thy God ? What about honoring your father and mother ? That 's the fourth commandment . Well , you 're
zone1	to that one . Oh , father . What page was that on ? I do n't know what page it 's on . You made me do it . What have you done , Dan , what have you done ? You hit your son ! Well , he was just trying to pound some religion into me , mother . He tripped over the table . Will you get out of here ? Dan , will you get ... come on , come on , come on . Oh , please ... get on down to the legion . Now do n't get yourself , lu , all excited . Put it on . Yes , mother , I 'll put the coat on , but I wish you would n't get yourself ... and your hat , now , go on . Put the hat on . Maybe they 've got some more beer left . There is . A whole barrel of it . So you 're against me , too . Guess I 'm just too dumb to get it . No , you 're
zone1	bright . Hitting your own son . No , I did n't hit him , I just merely pushed him ... get out of here . ' Cause he 's clumsy . Well , I 'll have to go and change , mother ... I know you will ... I know ... wait a minute . Just let me ... let me sterilize it for you . Oh , mother , you do n't have to . Put a band-aid on it or something . Oh , that 's an ugly thing . Well , I told you that this would happen . I know you did , I know . I just ca n't talk to him . Well , there 's my cab , mother . Here , I 'll do it . Well , I 've got ta change my pants anyway . And I 've got ta catch the plane before midnight . Call a cab ? Yes , be there in a minute . I 'll get it , mother . Hello ? Ben ! Well , how are you ? Where are you ?
zone1	came down to pay a visit to mother and dad . Chuck , how are ya ? Hiya , boy . You keep up the fight in the home front , wo n't ya , John ? Yes , yeah , I 'll be in there punching . Well , good luck to both of you . And I 'll put somebody on so you can get your money 's worth . Hello , Chuck . You in San Francisco ? I got the kimono , it 's wonderful . I was a little disappointed though , no opium pipe . She got the kimono . Hi , mom . Hello , Ben . Chuck says you may be leaving soon . I hope you 're on a slow boat . Goodbye , boys . Goodbye , mom ! Byebye . They 're leaving , John . I wo n't hear those voices again for a long time . Well , mother , maybe we 'll have a lasting peace one day soon . Oh , you fight for that , John , in your way , and say a
zone1	light two candles for them , I 'll light one for you , too . Good . Bye . Now , do n't forget you 're my tomorrows , John . What 's the matter , dear ? Goodbye . Oh , your knee . Oh , it 's all right . Soso many things on my mind . What are you gon na do about the trousers ? Oh , they 're ruined . Throw them away . Give them to father o'dowd . Goodbye . And you drive carefully now . - So long ! - Or I 'll school you ! Good morning . Good morning . I 'll fix that . You look like you finished the barrel . People who are n't so bright can hold a lot . Dan , I blew up . I 'm sorry I threw you out of the house . That is a commie specialty . - What ? - Breaking up homes . I may not be bright , but I know that . I 'll have to talk to you in the morning . John stands for
zone1	time , but he loves humanity , Dan . He may love humanity , but he 's not for his old man . I 'm a human being , I 'm human . No crying , jagna . Ca n't stand anybody that looks into the future . You ca n't even stand . I 'm all right . John explained it all so clearly , Dan . You 're suspicious of anybody that has liberal views . Saint Paul was a liberal ... leave Saint Paul out of this . You leave the lamp alone . Listen . Let 's just stick to John 's kind of liberalism , hm ? They just caught one of his kind down in Washington . But you do n't mean for a minute to infer ... she knows a lot of people that talk just like our son John . That 's the beer talking . No , it is n't . I switched to bourbon . You 're in fine shape to teach little children in the morning . I 'm not teaching little children in the morning . I 'm
zone1	's the use of teaching honesty , goodness , love of home and country ? Hm ? Nobody gives a hang . Oh , some mothers are very interested in report cards . Good grades , not character , high marks . Fathers , they just do n't care . I take that back . One father did come to the school . He wanted me fired . He heard that I had mentioned God in the classroom . His little son of a ... father like that snitched on me . I must teach his little stool pigeon reading , writing , and ' rithmetic . Just suppose that he gets excellent in the three r 's and he gets a goose egg for character . Reading , excellent . But if he reads nothing about his faith , whatever it might be , his head will be as empty as ... as John thinks mine is . Take writing . There 's a lot of good writing on bad checks . Forgers have excellent penmanship . Am I boring you ? Oh , go to bed , you
zone1	hit your son . I 'll tell you now and then I 'll go to bed . I saw red when he said that i made it difficult for him to honor his father and his mother . It 's wrong . He honors his mother . And so do I . I honor you , lu . But he makes fun of ... oh . I 'm sorry . It 's all right . But he makes fun of his father . You saw how he acted when I sang my song . ? If you do n't like your Uncle Sammy ? ? then go back ... ? ? Now who 's breaking up our home ? If I broke anything , I 'll fix it . I just wanted to show you how silly your son behaves . Where does he get his awkwardness ? You know , I 've been thinking . I 'm not going to quit . I 'm going back to school in the morning and keep on teaching little children . Hello ? Yes . Yes . Hello , John . How
zone1	's too bad your father is n't here so you could talk to him . Well , John , I know how busy you are and this is expensive , but believe me it was worth it , dear . And I hope that your day is as bright as you 've made mine . Goodbye . What ? Oh . Your trousers ? Those old things ? Well , I gave them to father o'dowd like you told me to . Why ? Did you leave anything in them ? John , you seem upset . Is that why you called ? All right . All right , I 'll get them . I w ... I will . I 'll get them this evening . Right away . All right . Your father has the car , but I 'll walk over . All right . Well , it was good to get to talk to you , John . Goodbye . What is the reason for this visit , Mr . ? You did n't tell me your name before . Suppose you start right off by
zone1	. Jefferson . Federal bureau of investigation . Mm-hmm . No , I wo n't , uh , take your hat . I have a feeling that you 're not going to stay long . Would you mind if I sit down ? I do n't care . I 'm aware this is a shock to you and I ... I do n't want to frighten you . I 'm not at all frightened , Mr . stedman . I seem to ... to startle you . Naturally . When you showed me who you are . No , no , even before that . I ... I thought that you looked , uh , you looked more shocked when you saw me than when you found out who I am . Well , suppose you say why you 're here and I 'll try to have the right expression . It 's about John . What 's he d ... what do you think he 's done ? I 'm not sure that he 's done anything . Well , you wo n't be any more sure by talking
zone1	tell you anything anyway . Well , you 're within your rights to refuse . Were you within your rights when you wormed your way ... that 's right , you wormed your way , into my confidence so I 'd do a lot of talking . I know that ... that our methods are very often criticized by certain sources because we 're after them day and night . But nobody objects to a firm that protects its business by investigating your credit . Insurance outfits have to protect themselves by thorough investigations . Well , I ... I 've always had great respect for you people , up to now . Do you ... you care to answer any questions ? Or not ? Like , for instance ? I 'd like to know why John left suddenly . Well , I know why . He had a perfectly good reason for leaving suddenly . But I see no reason why I should tell you . I know this , though , I 'm leaving suddenly . I have a lot of things to do . I have
zone1	lot of things i have to do . You can stay around though , it 's all right . Look the house over . Oh , you 'll find my beds are n't made . I have n't done my housework yet , thanks to you . Oh . There you are , father . Oh , hello , there ! Did you come over to help us ? I want you to see this . Now there 's something that anybody could use . Mrs . mooney gave me that . Oh , the woman has a heart of gold . Father , I want something back . You Indian giver . Well , you know those trousers I gave you ? They 're John 's and he wants them back . Then he 's the Indian giver . Perhaps he left something in them . No , I , uh , I asked him that and he said no . They seem worthless to me . Well , we 'll find them if they 're here . Here 's some of my stuff . Would you have any
zone1	... they were gray . - Gray . - Flannel . Flannel . They had a little stripe in them , I think . Gray flannel with a little stripe in them . There 's gray flannel with a little stripe in them , but , uh , that 's a coat . Is there any other kind of a hint that you could give me or a clue ? Yes , there is . Here they are . Well , they 're not much , are they ? Well , to me , those trousers are a complete ruin . That 's what I tried to tell him . How in the world did he ever do that ? Hehe ... he sort of tripped . He had a nasty fall . Well , I do n't care who his tailor is , he 'll never fix that up so they look like their Sunday best . Well , they 're good material though , you know ? Oh , yes , they are good mat ... oh , he could fix it , he could . Of course
zone1	the time . I 'll tell you what you could do . You could cut them off right there . Make short pants of them . Oh , I noticed Sunday when I talked to John , he 's changed considerable since he wore short pants . But I 've always said he was the best altar boy I 've ever had . He not only served the mass , but he had sort of a , well , a nuance . He looked good doing it , like a notre dame quarterback . And on the other hand , you 'll take Chuck and Ben . When they served the mass ... now look at ya . The minute I mention Chuck and Ben . Goodbye , father . Goodbye . Will you do that ? Excuse me just a moment . Arbie 's ? Just a moment . Telephone . Yeah ? She got in , huh ? It looks like it . Well , she 'll either come to see me or go to that other place . Yeah , well , there 's a nice view
zone1	the capitol over here . And , uh , down through here there 's a little park that , um ... Oh , you 're tired , mother . Why do n't you sit down ? Now , tell me , how did you get here ? I flew . No ! How did you get up enough nerve to get on a plane ? Oh , I have n't . You seemed so anxious to have these in a hurry . Oh , but you did n't have to ... well ? Oh , mother , you could 've mailed them . I mean , I merely wanted ... the trousers , yeah . Not particularly glad to see me , just glad to see the trousers , huh ? Oh , mother , the trousers . I 'm tickled to see you . I 'm just ... well , I 'm just surprised that you 'd fly all the way down here . Yeah . Well , things work out for the best , do n't they ? Here I made such a fuss over these trousers and
zone1	to see you . You know , when you told me that you had to walk all that way it worried me and I called you back to tell you to take a cab on me , but there was n't any answer . Oh , I was gone , I ... But there was somebody there . He ... no , I guess maybe he was gone , too . Who ? That man you 're not worried about . He came back . As long as you 're not worried about him , his name is stedman . He came back . Well , then you brought these trousers down just so you could talk about him , hm ? You know , I 've been thinking about him . He could have been with the FBI , you know , on one of those routine loyalty checks . We should n't resent it . I mean , after all , it 's their duty to investigate and protect us . And they 're having to work overtime these days , you know , I mean , they
zone1	, I see what you mean , mother . My gosh . But it 's amazing , you know , what our weavers can ... Um . Mother , what was that man 's name again ? You mean stedman , do n't you ? Ca n't I help you anymore ? Do n't deceive me , John . If there 's anything wrong , if you just tell me , you know , then maybe I could help . What are you looking for ? Is it a key ? Well , I thought maybe that there was a key in my trousers , mother , and I thought maybe that you might have it . It 's the key to my apartment . But , darling , it 's of no importance . John , darling , is it of no importance ? Mother , it 's of no importance whatsoever . I mean , I lose it so many times . You know , I hate to keep asking the landlady for another . Do you have it ? Yes , I do , I have the
zone1	called you back . No . It was to take a cab . Mmhmm . But I also wanted to tell you about the key , too . I feel faint . I 'm sick . Oh , mother . I hate to rush you , John , but without you , the committee 's just sitting there . Mother , now I 'm in the middle of a big conference right now , but I 'll break that up and take the rest of the day off , hm ? No , it ca n't be . Thought that was you and then I said to myself , " now what in the world can she be doing in Washington ? " Well , I still say what are you doing in Washington ? Came down to see my son . Please do n't ask a lot of things you know already . May I ask if you 're going back to see him again ? Yes , I am . He 's just going to be busy for the next hour and a half . And I could
zone1	long as you have some time on your hands , you certainly picked out a nice spot here . I guess you know that 's Jefferson 's memorial over there . He called this liberty of ours a gift of God . The words are inscribed on the memorial . That 's the Washington monument and , um , the Lincoln memorial . No , you ca n't see that from here . That 's just over there beyond those trees . And then , uh , beyond that across the river is Arlington cemetery . That 's famous for those who gave their lives for us . Well , how are those two fighting halfbacks of yours ? Have you heard from them ? They sailed . Now we have to fight on the home front for those two . They 're fighting for everything these dead held dear and the living should . Whatwhat are you trying to do ? Fire up my patriotism ? II just want you to appreciate that everything I 've done on this case I 've done to preserve the things that you
zone1	Jefferson . Do you think my boy is mixed up in this ? Oh , if you thought for one moment . Oh , he could n't possibly . Did , um , did John ever get any phone calls when he was down at the house ? Yes , he ... you were there . We have this miss carlin down here in the district jail . I think it might be a good idea if you listen to her voice and , you see , you have plenty of time . I have my car up here . I warn you , it was n't a very good connection . I remember that . So I picked her up after she left you . I felt sorry for her . Had to have our little joke . Could n't say she was glad to meet me . Hoped she would never see me again . She wanted to make sure that you were n't going to follow her . She 'll turn here in a minute . Mm-hmm . She watched you go around the corner . There
zone1	no chances of being followed . Smitty picked her up here in his car . Then carlin 's apartment is over here on the left , huh ? That 's right . We , uh , we had two hidden cameras outside Ruth 's apartment up here . Mmhmm . See , one was hung from the fire escape and we picked her up coming in the hall . Yeah . Look at that . Look at her hand shake . I do n't blame her . Mine would , too . She knows now . She had all of her chips on this one son . Got a real problem on her hands now . I picked her up here later in the park , sitting on that bench . The beating she 's taken . I 'm gon na have to ask her questions . She being a truthful woman , every answer is going to incriminate her son . It 's gon na be quite a test . God and country or her son , John . She 's headed for the airport now and home .
zone1	Lu ? Lucille ? Hey , lu . What 's the matter ? What have you been up to ? What 's happened ? I flew to Washington , Dan . To see John . You flew to ... Well , I thought we were going to fly together to see him . You beat me to it . You went to apologize for me , huh ? Maybe you 're just a little air sick , dear . I am a little sick , Dan . I had to see John . I 'm sorry , lu . About everything . I brought this all on by hitting my own son . Hitting him was just like hitting you , was n't it , dear ? How could a man be so dumb ? No , you 're not , Dan . Look , I know , I 'm just not very bright . You never said it truer . You are the brightest and dearest . You 've got more wisdom than all of us because you listen to your heart . You 're not blinded by it
zone1	and honest and clean . Now do n't overdo it , lu . See , when you talk like that , you 're the one that 's not thinking so straight . It 's not your fault , Dan . Yes , it is . Lu . Lu , I 've been suffering all day long . I 'm gon na tell John tomorrow how wrong I was . I 'm speaking honestly from my heart . What 's the matter , lu ? Would you call Dr . carver , huh ? What is the matter , dear ? I feel ... I do n't know . I feel I want Dr . carver , Dan . Well , here . Lie down . We 'll cover you up . You know , we 'll get Dr . carver . Oh , oh , well , they have no phone , have they ? No , I know , I know . Lu , the doctor 's over at the rebners ' . Now , I 'll go get him . It should n't take very long . Mother
zone1	you avoided your father . I came here to find out about you . Why did you leave the office ? We 'll get around to that . Oh , mother , you had me worried sick . Yes , mm-hmm . Did you tell father about your little trip ? I did n't tell him all about it . If I had , it would kill him . Or he 'd kill you . He ... I 've sent him for the doctor . What would kill him , mother ? I mean , I do n't follow . I do n't understand . If he knew that the FBI is after you , John . Mother , I thought I explained to you all about the FBI . Now , no more fancy lies , John . You 'll spend your tomorrows in a federal prison unless you can explain the key to that carlin girl 's apartment . Well , now , what makes you think that I ... because it fits . It opens the door . You mean you went to her apartment ? I
zone1	. Mother , are you out of your mind ? Not yet . You lied to me so much , John , that I had to know the truth . Do I know it now ? Are you guilty , John ? Mother , I 'm guilty to this extent . Now , wait just a minute . You see , darling , Ruth carlin and I were intimate , quite intimate . And naturally , I hesitated telling you . Only one ... one sin in the constitution and that ... and that 's treason . I do n't know what 's happened to my morals for the moment , but is ... is that all ? Is that all you have done ? That 's all , mother . That 's bad . But it 's good . That 's right . But who would believe it , mother ? Besides you and me . Mr . stedman would believe it . He 'd understand . We could get him on the phone . Well , no , mother , that is n't necessary , dear . We
zone1	a secret just between us . But we have to tell Mr . stedman , Johnny , he wo n't let it go any further . Oh , I 'll be so happy to tell him . Mother , have you seen him again ? Yes , he came up to me in the park and he took me to see her . To see ... But I ... I did n't recognize her voice , John . He took you down to the jail ? Well , that 's why we ca n't tell him , mother . I mean , he ... It 's his job to persecute innocent people . No , he 'd believe us , John . Un ... unless you 're lying again . You are lying . Look at you . You are guilty . Mother , darling . " Mother , darling . " Listen to you ! Pleading for love , mercy , all the things you 've scoffed at . Now you 're asking for mother love . Confess to the FBI , John . You 've given up your
zone1	them anyway . I 'll reach my own decisions , mother . You have to make one big one right now , John . Mother , if you will stand by me , I know that I can show you the light . After I make my speech to the graduating class ... after you what ? Oh , no , you 're not . Just because my son has been poisoned , I 'll ... I 'll not let him infect other mothers ' sons and daughters . Are you planning to make them over to your pattern ? Made in your image and likeness ? God , help him . Look , before father gets back , please give me the key . The key ? Yes , the key , the key to your freedom . So you 'll be free to go on making other young people as wretched as you are . Spreading despair . Oh , disguised as hope . Well , now , uh , mother ? How do you plan to stop me ? I 'll tell all I know if I
zone1	. But I have n't lost all faith in you . There are issues in the world today , mother , that transcend a mother and son . Yes , there are things that are far greater than you and me and we have to face them , not as mother and son , but as individuals . The cord is severed . All right . So , as an individual , I believe in human dignity , truth . Wow , you certainly are n't talking as a mother now . But you 're ill , dear . You 're talking insanely . Am I ? Within your state of mind , dear , no one would believe what you 're saying . And I 'd be forced to agree with them . A woman in your time of life , dear , under a doctor 's care , two boys in uniform , a husband , my father , inflaming you with patriotic fanaticism about spies and traitors . John , you could n't . Do ... do you mean that ... You might perhaps have me put
zone1	come . I want to give him the key . Dan , I ca n't fight much longer . Is it in your purse ? No , it is n't . What are you going to do , John ? Use force and violence on your mother ? Someday , mother , you 'll understand how big our fight is . I do now , I do now . No , you do n't . There are millions on my side . Millions on my side . And what a fight you have on your hands . Wait a minute , mother . Do n't say a word about this . Why not ? Dan , Dan . Hello , Mrs . Jefferson . Come in , Mr . stedman . This is my son , John . Well , I 'm sorry , Mr . stedman , you could n't have come at a worse time . My mother is very ill . Well , I 'm sorry to hear that . But my father will be here any minute with the doctor , but we 're terribly worried
zone1	been imagining all sorts of things . No . He came at a good time . He came at a good time . Come in , Mr . stedman . You , too , John . Go ahead . You start it , Mr . stedman . I would like to ask a few questions . Yes , indeed , I am ... and that is if your mother 's condition will permit . Well , obviously , it does n't , I 'd like to ask you a few questions myself first . We gather information , we do n't give it up . Mr . stedman , you know that it 's within our rights to ask you to leave this house immediately . No , John , this is my house . It has a mortgage on it . You know that , John . We always thought it was such a wonderful mortgage . Maybe , uh , the bank will , uh , come and throw us all out . I 'd like to get rid of this house . It 's old fashioned .
zone1	, that should give you an idea of my mother 's condition . Mrs . Jefferson , I would like to ask you , where did you go after you left ? Oh . You . You take over whenever you want to . Uh , so , after you left me , I ... Could I tell this in my own way ? Certainly . I 'll get back to your , um ... All right . I went to a church because I was a confused stranger down there . And a ... a church is , um , a traveler 's aide to people who do n't , uh , know which way to turn . That would straighten out a lot of people . Oh , yeah . They ... they should try the church . Then they 'd begin to remember things that they 've , uh , lost , like honor . My sacred word of honor . Tell people . Tell them about their sacred word of honor . I 'll tell them . Mother will be to drum next , singing "
zone1	. Do n't talk like that about your mother . There 's nothing petty about your mother , is there ? No . You be nice to her , you promise . Promise . I promise . Those ... two two boys of yours , those two halfbacks , they 're gon na be marching soon , are n't they ? Yes . They 'll sing with us . ? He died to make men holy ? ? They may die to make men free . There they are , yeah . They called me from San Francisco . What fight they had . Do you remember , John , hm ? Yes , dear . Many is the game they pulled out of the fire when time was running out . When time was running out , John . Yes . You never played , did you ? No , dear . I think sometimes it hurt you when your father and I jumped up and down cheering for them . Which you remember that I whispered to you , " keep on studying , there are other goals
zone1	for Ben and Chuck again . They 're fighting on God 's side now and I 'm fighting with ' em . The doctor will be here any minute , darling . You listen to me , John , you 've got to get in this game and you 've got carry the ball yourself . Well , you 're doing all right ... I 'm carrying it now , but I want to pass it to you , hm ? Take the ball , John . I ... I do n't want to make this last play . John , time 's running out . We ca n't stop that clock . John , take the ball before the clock runs out , John . I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm cheering for you now . My son John , my son John , my son John ... mother , why do n't you go upstairs and lie down , darling ? There 's the gun . We lost . That was a tough one to lose . Mother . Mother ? Take him away , take
zone1	to be punished , John . You look a little sick . I ... I used to spank your little bottom , but you 're big now . You 're big . Mother , darling , will you listen ? Your conscience must be nauseated . The lower you sink , the higher you rise in your party , do n't you , John ? Come on , doc . Go on in , doc , she 's right upstairs in the bedroom . You know where it is . No , she 's , uh , she 's right in there . Oh , thank you . What are you doing here ? Now wait just a minute , Mr . Jefferson . A lot 's gone on since you left . About John ? Is that Dan ? She 's taken an awful beating . Yeah ? I was just saying that we ought to sell this place . Yes , yes , dear . Get rid of it because , uh , it 's too much . Right , now just ... just be quiet . We
zone1	witness is in a pretty bad way . Testimony may never be any good now . Well , for the moment , it looks like our case is shut . I 'll be in as soon as I can . Right on . Now , try to get a grip on yourself , Dan . How can I with a traitor for a son ? He said he could n't prove that . How did he happen to let him get away ? He said he could n't hold him without Lucille . And we wo n't know about her ... he got out of here before I killed him . Shh , please . I 'm trying to get her to sleep . How is she ? She 's not going to lose her mind . My own flesh and blood . Doc , doc , you 've known me for a long time , have n't you ? Sure , sure . I never , never in my life have I done anything to ... I know , Dan , I know . And she ... And she
zone1	Dan ? Let 's pray for John . All right , dear . Our father who art in heaven , hallowed be they name , thy kingdom come . Thy will be done , on earth as it is heaven . Give us this day our daily bread and for ... forgive us ... Attention , please . Flight 92 for Lisbon now boarding at the concourse gate number 20 . All aboard flight 92 , please . Hello . Yeah . John ? I understand you 're on your way to Lisbon . Huh ? Well , what happened ? Not going . Passenger John Jefferson , the plane for Lisbon is leaving immediately from gate number 20 . What time to make a big decision . Well , do you want to come over here and let me help you make it ? By yourself . Well , John , I do n't understand you . You want to do one decent thing , what is this decent thing you want to do ? Well , uh ... No , we do n't make deals . Well ,
zone1	, even Judas . Passenger Jefferson , this is the final call . John , does anyone else know you 're not going to Lisbon ? Now listen , John , use whatever free will you have left to make your own decision and get over here . All right . All right . What is the deal ? Well ... Do we make out a warrant ? Maybe . Maybe we do . Why , John , what an honor ! Oh , I 'd give my life to make you truthful . I 'm cheering for you this time , John . I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm cheering for you now . Go on , rise to it . You can do it . I mean , everybody has some purpose in life , even Judas . John , I do n't understand you . You want to do one decent thing , what is this decent thing you want to do ? Just because my son has been poisoned I 'm not going to let him infect other mothers ' sons and daughters .
zone1	lives and break their parents ' hearts . You 're not going to tell those young Americans to use their God given liberty to destroy liberty . Members of the graduating class and their fathers and mothers , I mention your parents because I address you as representing their tomorrows . I wish he 'd call . Give up , name names . Mmhmm . Some people would rather he did n't , I imagine . Yeah . Hello ? Yes , John . You finished your commencement address and you want me to hear it ? Well , John , look , I warned you about us making any kind of deals bec ... John . John ! Yes , and someone else can hear you , too . John , get out of there as fast as you can . Take Pennsylvania Avenue . Is there someone that 'd rather you did n't get there ? I think we 're being followed . We 'll soon find out . Hold on , mister . Well , at least the driver was n't hurt . Hey , just a
zone1	Hello , Mr . stedman . They got me . Yeah , I know who . Try not to move , John , the ambulance will be here in a minute . I 'm sorry . I wanted to make a speech to the graduating class . Where is it , John ? Do you have it ? I have n't got it . It 's in my office . I made a recording . A recording . I 'll get it . I 'll get right over there . If I think the students should hear it , they 'll hear it . I might add that , um , he was to have been given the honorary degree of doctor of laws this day . So the , um , speech was found in his office by the federal bureau of investigation . You will now hear it verbatim as recorded by John Jefferson , class of 1941 . Members of the graduating class and their fathers and mothers . I mention your parents because I address you as representing their tomorrows . Sometimes this day is called
zone1	me , it will be both , but my life will be altogether different from yours . By now , a plane has arrived in Lisbon . It would have carried me far beyond the laws of my native land , but no plane , no means of transportation , nothing can take a man away from himself . He lives with himself day and night . His conscience lives with him , its voice will not be stilled . Mine warned me that I would not be free in Lisbon , that I would only find my freedom here . So here I stand . Hardly believing that but a few years back i sat down there in my cap and gown , like all of you . I looked like you then . I felt like you feel today , ready to go forward , full of zeal , full of purpose . I was going to help make a better world . I was flattered when I was immediately recognized as an intellect . I was invited to homes where only superior minds communed . It excited
zone1	n't have dreamed of when I lived at home . A bold defiance of the only authorities my church , and my mother and father . I know that many of you have experienced that stimulation . But stimulants lead to narcotics . As the cellar of habit forming dope gives the innocent their first inoculations with a cunning worthy of a serpent . There are other snakes lying in wait to satisfy the desire of the young to dedicate themselves to something positive , to give their existence purpose . And the lure is to every young American 's sense of justice , their love of fair play that makes all decent men rebel against the evil forces that exploit the weak . With the purest and noblest motives , we eagerly embrace an organized , definite , and active movement to alleviate the suffering all around us . Our beautiful liberalism is now aroused and we have faith in ourselves , our comrades . Somewhere along the line , our brain has been numbed so that we have substituted faith in man for faith in God . Even

No one warned me as solemnly as I am warning you now . Hold fast to honor , it 's sacred . No one tried to live the part they wrote for me more than I did . But living it with no spiritual compass , i lost all sense of direction . Any means justified their ends . Shameless falsehood , self-abasement , treachery . And before I realized the enormity of the steps i had taken , i was an enemy of my country and the servant of a foreign power . Now you know that the honor conferred upon me in this citation is false . Every word in it is a lie because I am a living lie . I am a traitor . I am a native American communist spy . And may God have mercy on my soul . There is another paper waiting for me , this time

There was a lot of good in what he said . Some of those ... yes , let 's hope they forget what he did . And pray they remember what he said today . Yes .

There 's nothing but women in this town . - Are you complaining ? - No men . Where are the men ? - If you -- - Anne . Anne , please . Excuse me , I did n't say nothing . No . No , it 's alright . That one must 've killed off all the guys in this town . We ought to tell them where they are . Why embarrass them , they 'll find
zone1	talk with her . It 's the first time she 's had a chance to flirt . And my sister , Barbara . She 's a wonderful cook . Tell me something . How old are you ? Fourteen . Why ?

I 'm sure it 's nothing compared to American towns . Why , it 's different . It 's more like England . - Oh , you know England ? - Yes . My sister and I went back there to school . - We 're glad you 're here . - Thanks . The way the Japanese kept coming down the map . We were beginning to get afraid . Well , if we were n't afraid we were lonely . Honestly . - All squared away , sir . - Good . It 's nice to have talked to you . My name 's Evelyn . Evelyn Leslie .

zone1	now and having the time -- - Dee is married . - Oh , that 's true . - But still .. - Now that 's enough . I 'm late getting back to work . Do n't pick on Evelyn , what she 's doing is perfectly normal for a girl and we do n't want her sneaking out behind our backs . Do n't see why I 'm the one who 's standing up for decent behavior . - We all want decent behavior . - Yes we all want it . What do we do about it . You let Dee go -- It was not a question of letting . Dee needed to be near family , especially now . I think one of us should go up and see Delia in Wellington . Dee is a married woman .

Oh , get the family together again . You 're sweet , Barbara . Anne would n't have put it quite so nicely . ' I suppose all sorts of gossip has been .. ' ... trickling back to Christchurch . Hm ? How about coming home , Dee ? - I can't . - ' Think about it . ' But I ca n't . Shiner 's been away how long ? And he 'll be away , God knows how much longer . Mark 's been away too , Dee . ' But you love Mark . ' That 's a terrible thing to say , is n't it ? But you knew it all along . So you have someone to think about , plan for . I only want Shiner to come back so that we can get a divorce . Well that 's honest , but
zone1	Americans . They 're not ... English and all that . But I like them . And someday I might like to go to America . I would give anything to go to America . But I 'm married . And these boys are going off to the island . We only see each other until they sail . I do n't know how to talk to you , Dee . I wish you would n't .

Then you look down on the girls who are nice to you . Yeah , you 're right . I 'm sorry I sound dreadful .. No , no , I understand , you 've had it up to here . They 're not like this at home .

' Oh , thank you . Wo n't you come in ? Thanks . Headquarters wants to know if you wish to make any specific complaint . No , I 'm sorry , I really do n't . Thanks for taking that attitude . That 's very generous of you . I 'm sure they have reasons . Men away from home .. You people have been
zone1	homes . I 'm sure the boys that you 've entertained did n't act the way these men did in the store . The truth is that we have n't entertained any . I suppose we should have . You see , both our parents are dead and it makes it a little more difficult . You have a lovely place . It 's like an English cottage . Yes , you said you had been in England , did n't you ? Yes , I-I was at Oxford , I was a Rhode scholar . Well .. Have you , I mean , I suppose you 've had lots of invitations . Actually none since your little sister 's that first day . ' Anne , who is it ? ' Well , that was my fault I 'm afraid . But you all did seem rather overwhelming that day , right ? I guess we did . You thought that we 'd bring our trucks to dinner or something . I do n't know what 's for supper but you can come if you like .. ... and
zone1	Oh , I 'm afraid I trapped you into that invitation . We usually have supper at 6:30 . Can I bring something and help out ? Oh , no thanks . We 've quite enough . ' Anne .

He said that the boys who were entertained by families here acted better . - Thought we ought a do our bit . - Of course . We 'll have coffee in the other room by the fire . Can I help with the dishes ? What 's the matter ? - That 's women 's work . - Oh , not where I come from . Oh

Bates , what color do you want to be ? What do you mean ? Well , this is Mark . And this is Shiner . He 's Delia 's husband . That 's our sister in Wellington . This is where dad 's ship sank . And this is Tommy . A friend of mine . You can be purple , orange , pink . I do n't think I really belong up there . Why not this green one to match your uniform ?

zone1	getting gifts from you Americans , you know ? Americans like to give gifts . Oh , you 're very generous . But it 's all got involved with .. ... well .. What do I do now ? You said you could wash dishes . I 'm sorry , Barbara . It 's just that , he was , well , so nice . And all of a sudden those presents from the PX and then we were like the other girls scavenging from Americans . My mother always taught my sisters it was alright to accept the following gifts from a man candy , flowers and perfume . Even asked him to dinner that very first day . Come on . Wonder where . - ' He 'll be back . ' - ' Of course . ' No rumors even to go by . At the shop today , they said our troops are farther west then that in North Africa . - Oh , where ?

Not by watching . - Is she going to marry him ? - None of our business . Now get back to bed . Go on . Scoot . Tell me , what do you think of all the marriages between Americans and New Zealand girls ? I do n't think you wan na know what I think . I think you wan na tell what you think . One girl married a man from California . When she got there , she took one look at his home and turned right around and came back . Could happen . I-I have n't heard of anyone who went to your state Oklahoma and came back . That 's nice to know . Tell me , do you approve of these marriages between Americans and New Zealand girls ?

Yes , but I 'll start the machinery tomorrow . - Give us a little warning . - It 'll be a while yet . Sometimes they act a little faster for men who may be moving north . Nobody knows when , but the press would .. Well , I will be going sometime . So if you 'd like to think it over , Barbara . You and Anne have thought it over . That 's the only important thing . Perhaps they 'll decide to leave you behind this time . And anyway , we have until you sail . ' Along with the displeasure of the point of attack ' ' of theAmerican marines ' ' came

That 's where they 've gone . Where 's that ? One of the Gilbert Islands . It was due north . I 've never heard of it . First reports of casualties .. No names yet , just fantastic numbers . Richard will be alright . When he comes back , permission will have to have gone through . You 'll be married and it wo n't all be so rushed . Barbara , I 'm going to have a baby . Oh , Anne . Dick will come through alright . We both knew the ships were sailing soon , some other island . Anne , you do n't have to justify yourself to me . Everything 's changed so much . The way I used to feel
zone1	. Of course it 's convenient for me to understand her now . Makes me feel a little less alone and guilty . Darling .. What should we do , Barbara , if Dick does n't get back ? He will . It would be unfair if this family loses anyone else . If he does n't , I 'd like to have the baby here if you let me . Let you ? Whose home do you think this is ? How Delia would laugh . I do n't think so . I 'd like to phone Delia . Oh ... I wo n't say anything about Dick and .. Well ... I wo n't say anything probably , but .. ... just to talk to her . Suddenly feel I want to talk to her . Hello , I want a personal call , please . To Mrs . Delia Friskett at the St . George Hotel in Wellington . Oh , uh , Delia Leslie . Oh , um , Delia Leslie . Thank you . I 'll hold on . ' Let it ring . '
zone1	Yes , this is Delia Leslie . It 's my sister . Hello , Anne , hello . No , nothing 's wrong . We just thought we 'd call . I 'm fine . How are you ? Oh , I 'm fine . Uh , how 's Barbara ? Yes , yes , I 'm fine . How 's Evelyn ? Oh , Evelyn 's well . She 's not here but Barbara 's here . Say hello to Barbara . Hello , De . How are you ? Yes , fine . I take it everything 's good with you ? Yes , I 'm well . Well , I mean to write .. Yes , I 'm fine . Fine . Well , it 's good to talk to you . We will . Say goodbye to Anne . Goodbye , De . Keep well . And remember , we love you and miss you . Goodbye , De . Take care . I will . And thank you for calling . Goodbye . ' Give me a beer , huh ? ' - ' Now
zone1	do they have to call me ? - You 've got ta go back now . - Why ? Oh , you . Always asking why when you know perfectly well . Why ? You got some kinda monster inside that house you do n't want me to see ? I bet one of your sisters have got two heads . - Go on home . - Home ? what do you mean home ? I only meant I 've got ta go in now . I 'll see you when you get off next . Well , maybe you will or maybe you wo n't . When I was a kid I used to carry girls books home . - Well , I ai n't no kid no more . - Well , that 's up to you . Bye . Lots of girls walk with American soldiers . They 're real keen . - Darling , you 're only 15 . - He 's only 18 . I wish you would n't go with soldiers . Oh , for a couple of years yet . Iceberg Anne went
zone1	not so ... swell . Why ? Because ... Anne 's going to have a baby . Oh ! Alright , I 'll do what you say . I wo n't walk with Americans till I 'm 17 . What 's this about Americans ? I just met a nice Yank . We 've been walking together . Let 's agree on one thing . If you wan na talk to a soldier you 'll bring him home to meet us . That 's fair enough . Anne , you ruined it . She just promised not to see any Americans until she was 17 . But , Barbara , she 's almost grown . - Hello . - Hello . - This is a surprise . - Yes . I met this officer up in Wellington when I went to see Delia . For about ten minutes . Uh , I 'm looking for Anne Leslie . - I 'm Anne Leslie -- - Oh , I 'm sorry . This is my sister . Anne , major .. Harding . Has something happened to Richard Bates ? No
zone1	given the hazardous duty of checking on girls that Americans wan na marry . I looked over the forms that Bates filled out and I 've interviewed your minister , your friends your neighbors and you 're as good as married . Oh , and the , uh , the American government out of the goodness of its heart wants to give you this present . Oh , thank you . If you 're going to live in Oklahoma we want you to learn about it . We give lectures for brides-to-be at the Young Eagles Club . Uh , the lecturer 's a bore , but he means well . I guess all bores do . Well , you can tell your captain that everything 's cleared . He 's at Tarawa . Is there any way you could find out ? They wo n't let us have the casualty list yet . Red tape . You know , I often think that it must be harder on you people . I mean , waiting for word from Africa and now Tarawa . Barbara 's husband was killed last
zone1	. How could you ? Well , do n't forget your homework . Do n't worry . You 'll be in Christchurch for a while then ? I 'll be in and out until they certify me for combat duty again . Why do American lighters always work ? You were very nice to Anne at the meeting tonight . - Thank you . - Line of duty . No , she 's nice . - This Bates .. - He 's nice too . Maybe it will work . It 's more than you think of most of these war marriages I take it ? Mm-hmm . Why ? Because most of the people involved were just lonely . You know these guys come in and they say they never knew what true love was before they met the girl . Well , the truth is , they , they never knew what real loneliness was before they came here . Yeah , but the girls .. Well , it 's a little easier to understand them when you realize that our men have been away for more than
zone1	And hunger , yeah . There you are . Come on , let 's get out of here . Eat , drink and make love , for tomorrow we die . That 's Delia 's way of fighting the loneliness . Yes . Anne 's is another . A different way . But if Richard Bates is dead in Tarawa , where 's she ? She 's gon na have a baby , is n't she ? Yeah . Now , why do I wan na say that 's nice ? ' Cause it is n't nice . Not according to the standards that I was brought up by and you too , I 'm sure . But I wan na say that 's nice . For them to have known , uh the sweetness and the comfort of love before he dies . He must n't be dead . Yeah , but if he is .. ... then the sweetness turns sour . Time will see to that . And Bates ' a nice guy . While he lies dying in a ditch , what 's he gon na
zone1	And there you are . Oh , that 's where Delia , Anne and Dick are , but .. ... where are you ? This is what I spend the night with . And no regrets . Oh , I get a gentlemanly hangover in the morning , but no regrets . And nobody gets hurt . What 's the matter ? Nothing . Okay . What 's your solution ? Well , you said it was .. ... three years of hunger and loneliness . I 've got ta go in now . Evelyn 's alone . No , do n't bother . I hope everything 's alright . Thank you . What do you do now ? Go to your quarters and get drunk ? - Cold-blooded , is n't it ? - Yes . - Goodnight . - Goodnight . Barbara , uh , this is Max . - Max Murphy . - Hi . Hello , Max . Babs , Max thinks you make wonderful cakes . - Oh , yeah , they 're great . - Well , thank you . I was just down
zone1	they 're indoctrinating prospective American brides . Are you one of them ? No . Just curious . You sure do n't look like most of them look . I saw the last bride ship leave for the States . I would n't touch ' em with someone else 's ten-foot pole . - Have another cake , Max . - Oh , that 's alright . You know , I think most of the guys just got hooked . - Some gratitude . - Gratitude ? For what , Max ? Oh , I mean , savin ' your country . Oh , well , were you at Guadalcanal , Max ? Well , no . I just come off from Hawaii a couple of weeks ago . Oh ! But I 'm away from home now , for over a year , training ' . - Have you now ? - Have you really ? Yeah , it 's been plenty rugged . Anne , this is Max . Max Murphy . - Hello , Max . - Anne . Barbara . Oh , Evelyn , you entertain
zone1	? - I do n't know . I think your sister Barbara 's mad at me . That crack about the bride ship . - No . - Is she married , Barbara ? - She 's a widow . - Oh ! What about Anne ? Is Anne married ? Anne 's ... not married . ' You 've changed the way you wear your hair . ' When I left it was different . Or is this an optical illusion ? Can I cut in ? Thank you . - Hello , where have you been ? - Up in Wellington . - Investigating brides ? - Yup . Same hazardous mission . Oh , did you see Delia by any chance ? No . - How 's Anne ? - Fine . I understand that the permission for her marriage came through a week ago . It 's filed . - Does she hate Dick Bates now ? - No . - Herself ? - No , nobody . That 's nice . Has she been advised of her rights ? What do you mean ? There
zone1	of the illegitimate -- We do n't need that . Thank you . We do n't like thinking of it in that way . Alright . However , it 's nice of them setting up a board to have the whole thing organized . Anne may not hate anybody , but you do , do n't you ? No . Just the war . Sorry . What are you doing here anyway ? I did n't think you came to dances . It 's part of my job to show up at this .. How about you ? Oh , I 'm chaperone , you know . Old married woman . Who chaperones the chaperons ? - No , did someone bring ya ? - No . ' Barbara . ' I told you that practice is gon na pay off , huh ? Just stay loose , kid , ' cause here I go . Whole new bunch got in today . Most of mine leave from the forward areas . Oh ! And tomorrow morning the office will be swarming with guys with hangovers muttering that they never
zone1	marry the girl . I 've got a car with some $100 punch in the glove compartment . - Would you like to , uh .. - No , thank you . Okay . So you 're still carrying on your hot affair with the bottle ? Yup . I 'll hear from that in the morning . And what will you say to him ? Same thing my father said to me when I wanted to get married . Oh ! I met my wife .. ... during Easter vacation in Bermuda . I was a senior in college . I 'd never seen her before . The setting was perfect . Just like this one . The girl was beautiful . And there she was shimmering in the moonlight . Do n't make fun of it . Maybe I should n't . Well , my father .. " What do you know about the girl ? What she likes and dislikes ? " " Dad , " I said , " she likes to kiss in the moonlight . " And she dances like a dream . And
zone1	be again . " Sounds lovely . Yup , and so they were married . Six years later they became a statistic in the divorce records . I loved her , but I did n't like her . And she liked me , but she did n't love me . How was a guy supposed to know ? So , do you tell the boys that once back in Bermuda there was a moon like this one a girl you 'd only known for a week , et cetera , et cetera ? No . But I try to talk some sense into them . Like recommending the bottle . - Somehow that 's cheating . - What ? The bottle . How ? Removing you from it all . Might make you slightly patronizing to the boys who are not afraid to get involved . I 'm sorry . Barbara . Yes . I do n't .. I do n't love you . I know . And I do n't want to marry you . But I .. Oh , my darling . ' Our neighbor across the street

' - Would you get the light ? Oh , how lovely . Ooh , see the pretty tree . See that ? Oh , do you remember ? Father always said something at this moment . You do it , Anne . God rest all the men who fought for us all over the world . God rest the Americans who were with us ' and the nice one's who 've been to our house . ' Dick and ... John . Evelyn , uh , should we include Max Murphy ? No , he was a drip . Tommy will be home soon . And God rest all those that have gone . Mother , dad .. Kid .. Dick .. And Mark . ' And may the war end quickly ' and may everyone come home . Well , that 's all in this .
zone1	do . Well .. I just hope that when all this is over we 'll have a world where .. ... where he can grow up and grow old . ' Where he can become , well , a fine boy .. ' ... a husband , father , grandfather . Whatever else he wants to become . Did you hear that ? You 're going to become a grandfather . ' It 's almost midnight now . ' and Christmas starts around here at dawn . You could sleep here . Kid used to bunk out here . And once in a while Dick Bates . Take a look at the view . Remember , Barbara , we 'd lie here and look out .. ... and you 'd tell me things . Yes , I remember . So , it 's all set up . You 'll stay ? I 'm afraid not , Evelyn . I have to report back to the base tonight . Oh , gosh . Oh , I 've got ta help Anne . She 's absolutely no good at changing nappies .

Some battleship admiral took a look at what he had coming to him in the way of his staff . Discovered he raided a marine major and did n't have one -- - Whereabouts , do you know ? - I do n't know . Up north of here around Ulithi I guess . I 'm really not very happy about it . I 'm not a sea-going marine sitting around doing staff duty . It 'll be better than investigating prospective brides . Maybe . Thank you for my lighter . Merry Christmas . Happy New Year . I wish I had stuck to my bottle . Do you ? Really ? I do n't know . I , I know what you mean but these have been nice months . I think we 've both been .. ... a little less lonely . That 's for sure . You know

Wiser , yeah . No sadder ? I do n't know where I 'm going . I do n't know what 's gon na happen . I suppose , sooner or later we 're gon na have to land on the Jap mainland .. Well , if that happens , it 'll make Guadalcanal and Tarawa and the rest of them look like kid stuff . But , at least .. ... it wo n't be like with the others . You worrying whether I 'm dead or me lying in a ditch full of guilt . - That 's something . - It is . And we 've had a good time
zone1	strange the times that I .. ... times that I .. ... I told you how wonderful it was just to hold you .. ... and to have you hold me and nothing more . Some people could n't understand that . I do . It 's funny . It is . Well .. When I know where I 'm going , I 'll write . I 'll write too . There 's Tommy . Look , he 's grown a mustache . Oh , that 's not such a tragedy . I 've never kissed a man with a mustache before . Well , maybe he 'll shave it off for you . It 's good to have it over with , is n't it ? I mean , our part of it . I know you 're thinking about Okinawa , Barb -- Oh , it 's good . You be happy . Go on . Go on about Italy , Tommy . Go on about Italy .

I-I 've got a good job promised to me in Oakland after my leave . And I 've , I 've managed to save up some from my army pay .. Well ... well , I love Evelyn . Oh , Tommy . You do n't need to ask . The government is offering all returned men temporary passes on trains and planes . They want us to , to see the land we were fighting for . Wives can get along , so .. I saw the bloke and he said it 'd be alright if Evelyn went along . We 'd , we
zone1	be married at my uncle 's place up there . Of course , you can go . When do you plan to leave ? Oh , Barbara , I knew you 'd say yes . We 'll have to get you all done up a proper bride .

Are you going to tell me something like that ? Are you ? There 's no other way of saying it , Shiner . - I do n't love you anymore . - You never did . What difference does it make ?

' Undesirable is the word you 're looking for , is n't it , major ? ' - Yes . - Yes , undesirable . Your government did not want undesirables such as , shall we say , racketeers and gangsters . ' Now , of course , you would n't want ' ' people like that in America . ' ' Now , tell me , major , what kind of a woman ' ' did you find
zone1	No , I mean morally . Well , since I did n't know she was married I judged her to be satisfactory . What did you think later ? - I did n't think anything , sir . - Quite correct . It was n't your job to think . But what did you report ? ' Major , I said what did you report ? ' That , um ... she was living with a lieutenant before she met the marine who wanted to marry her . - ' An American lieutenant ? ' - ' Yes . ' ' Before that there was another American . ' Yes .

Who starts drinking before 10:00 AM ? I 'm taking that offer from live television . Tallyho . Are n't you ashamed , exiling poor Harry to live television ? - He made a remark I did n't like . - Like ? - Like I 'm putting on weight . - Well , so you are . And this does n't help . - Now do n't you start in . - All right . You start in , what 's wrong ? Nothing . I ca n't figure why you 're on the jug . You 've got everything to make you happy . You 're box-office . You 're beautiful . You 're single . Every married man in town is trying to date you . Your next picture is an epic . Do you realise that every actress in Hollywood would give
zone1	Nile , a controversial bestseller ? What troubles can you possibly have that warrant 90-proof drowning ? Now do n't cry , honey . You have n't even seen the screenplay of The White Virgin of the Nile . I talked to four of the screenwriters , one of them who 'd actually read the book , and he told me they 've only changed the last 200 pages of the original story . Now , honey , please . You 're still untouched in the script . You 've never seen a man . You do n't even know what a man is . I 'm gon na have a baby . Goodbye , Whitey the Virgin . Goodbye , 10% . Goodbye , Bel-Air mansion . Goodbye , Diners Club membership . Stop mumbling . You 're my agent , what do we do ? Do n't say we . Does anybody else know about this ? - Only you . - Only me ? Only me ? And since when have the birds and the bees changed their modus operandi ? - My husband was killed .
zone1	. Well , when did you get married ? Of course , if it 's all legal , you can still play the White Virgin . It 'll just be a tougher acting job , that 's all . That 's right , because I do n't have a marriage license . - What ? - I do n't remember where I was married . It was somewhere in Mexico , that 's all I know . Mexico ? You mean that publicity junket to Acapulco ? That 's it . Then I met Carlos . He was a handsome bullfighter . It was one of those romantic , full-moon nights like we have back home in Midvale . Back home in Midvale , Indiana , they do n't have bullfighters . And no tequila . And that 's what did it . So , when Carlos suggested we get married , it sounded like a good idea . We drove to a little place . I do n't remember getting there . All I remember is waking up the next morning , back at Acapulco , with a terrible
zone1	remember where you went . I 'll fly down and make a Photostatic copy of the license . I ca n't remember , it 's a blank ! All right , all right , so you woke up hung-over . And we realised we 'd made a mistake . We decided to have the marriage annulled after the bullfight that afternoon . But Carlos never came back from the bullfight . So I tore up our marriage license and came home . That 'll be for me . Tell them I 'll be right there , for my last scene in pictures . She 'll be right there . Good morning , sir . It 's the chief . Yes , Mr Rumpson ? A press conference announcing Carla as the White Virgin of the Nile ? Both Louella and Hedda will be there . I 'll come wearing my maternity dress . I 'm afraid Carla wo n't be able to make it . You see , she 's so thrilled about playing this great part that as soon as she finishes retakes today , she 's going into
zone1	ago . She 'll be away five months , sir . Yes . So as to get into the proper White Virgin mood . Well , thank you , sir . Goodbye . Now , you go away , let your hair go natural , take the caps off your teeth , take the padding out and no one will know you . What happens five months from now , fast-thinking agent ? You have your baby in some out-of-the-way maternity home . And what happens after my baby is born ? Well , you leave it somewhere and then , when the picture 's finished , you adopt it . Leave my baby somewhere ? I may not have been much of a wife , but I 'm going to be a terrific mother . I 'm not leaving my baby with any strangers . Oh , not strangers . You leave it in Midvale with your father . Papa 's worse than a stranger . He 's had nothing to do with me since I left home . There 's your sister , Sandra . What about her
zone1	I ca n't trust Sandy . She 's too young . And besides , she 's always been jealous because the boyfriend she liked was crazy about me . Clayton . - Clayton Poole . - Clayton Poole ? - Clayton Poole . - Clayton Poole ? Clayton is the one person I can trust . Oh , thanks . That 's nice . After I 've been practically an obstetrician to you . I trust you , Harold . Fasten me up . But Clayton really cares about me . Why , if it had n't been for Clayton , I would n't have had the courage to enter the Midvale Milk Festival where the studio discovered me . Oh , yes , I remember . Miss Butterfat of 1955 . And he 's always wanted to be a father . He 'll take wonderful care of my baby . Well , we 'd better call this rustic up . What 's his number ? We 'd better call him up and tell him he 's expecting . Give him a chance to lay in a stock of cigars
zone1	n't understand what a small town is like , and , believe me , Midvale is a small town . There is n't much to Midvale except a few stores and buildings around the old town square . Clayton and I used to meet under the statue of the hero of Midvale . I remember how Clayton always looked up and told me how some day he was going to also become a hero . What 's his number ? I 'll call him right away . If Clayton ever received a long-distance call , Miss Menefee , the telephone operator , would blab it all over town . So we 'll send him a letter . Clayton never receives any mail . No , a letter to Clayton would cause talk . Are you sure this noble character still lives in Midvale ? Clayton lives on Euclid Street in a remodeled carriage house , and the last I heard from my kid sister , Sandy , Clayton was working for Mr Wright , who owns the Midvale television store . How 's it now , Mrs Van Cleeve ?
zone1	TV , darlings . Now , do n't you be impatient , sweetie . - Clayton ! - Yeah , Mrs Van Cleeve ? It 's still snowing all over Art Linkletter . Keep watching . I designed this aerial for fringe areas , it should work . Hi , Tiger ! Hey , Tiger ! - Is that you , Sandy ? - It sure is . When 'd you get back from Hollywood ? This morning . Are you glad to see me ? Sure , I am , but I ca n't see you now . I get dizzy if I look straight down . But I wo n't be too long . How 's it now , Mrs Van Cleeve ? A little better , Clayton , but Arthur is still fuzzy . Keep watching . Hurry , Clayton . I have something for you . Something Carla sent you . Carla sent something for me ? Oh , Clayton , stop clowning . Clayton , what are you doing up there ? Hey , Clayton , stop it . Clayton , cut it out .
zone1	a brick hit him . Mr Newland . I 'm sorry , Mr Newland . I 'm sorry , Mr ... I 'm sorry , Mr Newland . I 'm sorry ! Mr Newland ! Mr Newland ! Mr Newland ! Oh , is he hurt ? I 'm awfully sorry , Mr Newland . Is he bleeding ? I hate blood . I ca n't stand that . Help me up with him , Sandy . You 'll be all right , Mr Newland . You can have my Blue Cross and you can take my green stamps also . Sandy , shut that off , Sandy . Oh , Mr Newland , I 'm awful sorry . Wait , Mr Newland . Just take it easy . I ca n't do it , Clayton . Here , hold Mr Newland . I 'll get it . Hold Mr ... Got it ? I ca n't get it , either . Wait , Clayton . I 'm sorry , Mrs Waters . Clayton , you come back here and fix that aerial . I 'll be right there ,
zone1	Cleeve . Clayton , you get up there right away and finish that aerial . Sandy , turn off the hose . Well , do n't worry , Mrs Van Cleeve . You do n't have to call the police . No , I 'll take care of everything . Yes . I carry insurance on Clayton and remember our motto , " If there 's anything wrong , we make it Wright . " " If there 's anything wrong , we make it Wright . " Well , everything is all wrong now , Mr Wright . Everything is , and everybody . It 's a mess ! My beautiful fish . My beautiful dog . I never want to see that Clayton again . I know you did n't wash me down the chimney on purpose , but I just want to be alone . I wan na get clean . Go home . Leave me alone to get clean . Alone . Home you go . Go home ! Clayton ? Do n't suicide . Clayton , I love you , darling . Do n't worry
zone1	, we 'll suicide together . Sandy , Sandy , I 'm sorry I got sore . Sandy , can you hear me ? Sandy ! Do n't worry , Tiger ! I 'll save you . Do n't help me ! Do n't help ! I do n't need help . - Sandy , I do n't need no help . - Now , do n't fight me , Tiger . - Here , Sandy . - Thanks , Clayton . Put it on before you catch a cold . - Clayton ? - Yeah ? Say , you 're not mad at me because I saved you , are you ? Nah . Besides , I could n't be mad around this place , anyhow . It sure is a romantic spot , ai n't it ? Yeah , Carla and I used to come here all the time . - Carla and you . - Yeah . We were just kids when I carved our initials in this tree . Gee , we used to have an awful lot of fun here . When we were kids
zone1	like it is now . To us at that time , this was ... Well , like a fairyland . There 's a summery breeze playing songs in the trees Dum-de-dum-de-dum-de-dah Nature has its own band And the music is grand In the Land of La La La Dipping peppermint creams into chocolate streams There is no one who 'll snitch to Ma You can dip with each hand Eat until you expand In the Land of La La La All the clouds are cotton candy and handy to try If you feel like having luncheon start munching ' the sky It 's a fabulous place Put a smile on your face Close your peepers And there you are If you 're ready to start Hop a rainbow cart Your heart will shout , Hurrah !

You 're a little girl yourself . Yeah , but have n't you heard that one little girl in the bush is worth two in Hollywood ? Hollywood ! That reminds me . You said Carla sent me something . What was it ? Carla , that 's all you can think of ! Come on , Sandy , what is it ? Sandy ? It 's a photograph . It 's in the truck . An autographed photograph ? Did she sign it ? Did she sign it herself ? Did you see her do it personally , or did her secretary do it ? I did n't see Carla , I was ... She was gone by the time I got to Hollywood . You did n't see her ? You were there all summer . Well , I stayed in the house
zone1	because I wanted you to miss me and even had my teeth capped by Carla 's dentist . And I come back and kiss you , and you did n't even notice the difference . But I did . I did notice the difference , Sandy . Honest . I was wondering where that funny little whistle was every time you talked . And really , I did miss you , Sandy . - Did you really miss me , Tiger ? - Well , sure . You play softball better than anybody I know . Some Tiger . I should have drowned him . " To Clayton . I have been thinking a lot about you lately . " " Signed , Carla . " She 's been thinking about me . Oh , boy . I wonder why she 's been thinking about me . Is it a boy or a girl ? Well , right now they all look like Yul Brynner . All ? Well , what do you mean ? Could be a boy and a girl and one to spare . Harold , not
zone1	First time out , a DeMille production . Oh , how wonderful . Oh , but poor Clayton . Now , come on , Carla , come on . Do n't kiss me in front of everybody . All the photographers are watching . Come on , Carla . Life goes to a party , but this is ridiculous . Hello , darling . Oh , it 's you . Well , you do n't have to sound that disappointed . After all , I 'm a woman with the same blood in my veins as my sister . What do you want ? Well , my television does n't work , and I want you to come over and fix it . At 1:30 in the morning ? Carla 's first movie is coming on the Late-Late-Early-Late Show . The Creature from the Lower Tar Pits ? You 're kidding ? Oh , boy . I saw that 16 times , remember ? Doc Simkins had to give me special massages . I 'll be right over . Wait a minute , what about your father ? Oh ,

Okay , Judge , that 's two beans more you lose . - Gigi Naples , he 's lucky at cards . - Not so loud , Gigi . You wan na wake up the hook-and-ladder boys ? You wo n't be so lucky when you get Clayton Poole for a son-in-law . That 's not funny . Take that back . Now easy , Gigi . Ca n't you take a joke ? I take a joke , but that jerk is no joke . He make my Carla full of big ideas to be a big movie star , so she leaves her papa . All right , now you leave the judge alone , Gigi .

Miss Bessie , I 'm awfully sorry that I interrupted you during the commercials . You know I believe in loyalty to the sponsor . That 's what 's wrong with the world today , not enough loyalty . That 's why you 're leaving town , because you 're loyal to your first love . Well , I
zone1	's ready for the next tenant . And I 'll come by and pick up my things later . You decided where you 're going yet ? I do n't know . I thought maybe I 'd hitch a ride up the Old Lake Road and maybe go to Chicago or somewhere . If you 're interested in what an old lady thinks ... Oh , watch it , Miss Bessie . Well , you know I 'm always interested in what you think . Well , if you want to know what this old lady thinks , she thinks it 's about time you got out of Midvale . Forget this Carla , find someone else . Oh , Claytie , you 've been like a son to me , running to the market every time one of those TV fellas says , " Go to the market and get some . " I 'll never forget you , Claytie . Goodbye , Miss Bessie . Are n't they the most wonderful little things in the world , Harold ? They prove tequila does n't hurt the birth rate
zone1	. Well , let 's hope we catch that joker so you can leave them . Are we anywhere near the Old River Road yet ? Miss Bessie must have told you the Old Lake Road . Maybe . It was hard to understand that old doll with her TV blasting and with her eating raviolis and chewing bubblegum at the same time . - Does she always smoke cigars ? - Only when they 're sponsored . Oh , do n't drive so fast , Harold . I know where we 'll find Clayton . When you love in vain Love is a lonely thing Like an endless chain You keep remembering All the countless times You thought you caught her eye How she passed you by Almost unaware that you were there But when she takes your hand Then it 's a lovely thing Flowers dot the land And all at once it 's spring You hold her in your arms And then she whispers low I love you , love you When you 're dreaming Love 's a lonely thing Hello , Clay . Carla ? Yes
zone1	believe it . ' Cause whenever I come here I see you all over the place , but it 's never really you . It has been a long time . Let 's sit . There 's something in my eye . Quiet , you little schedule-breakers . Your mother 's busy lining up a six-months ' baby-sitter . You have n't forgotten me , Clay ? Forgotten you ? No , I have n't forgotten you , Carla . As far back as I can remember , you 're all I ever think about . I even remember the color of the dress you wore that Easter Sunday that you made me steal the money from the collection plate to buy the ice cream cone with . And when I got a little older and I gave the money back , then I joined the Camp Fire Girls just so I could be near you . Remember when my voice started to change and they threw me out ? I remember . I was a terrible child . No , you were n't , Carla . Really , you
zone1	did n't go for a guy like me , that looked like me . I even took a muscle-building course so that you would n't laugh at me when we went swimming . That did n't do very much good , because I could n't find my muscles to build them up . That was n't the main trouble , anyhow . The trouble was my face . And I could n't wait until hair would grow on it so no one would have to see it . I had that beard long before that Schweppes man , remember ? I remember it all . And , well , I ca n't sleep just dreaming about you , Carla . Matter of fact , I dream about you every night . Same silly dream . I 'm Sir Galahad in shining Armour , and you 're always in trouble and you need me . How right you are . And in the very same dream , I always come up charging on the white horse to save you from the terrible trouble . So , how could you say I
zone1	that I could forget you . Except , look , I 'm taking you with me so I ca n't forget you . I 'm taking you with me so I ca n't forget you . I 'm not just crazy about you , Carla . I 'm just plain crazy . What 's the matter , Carla ? Did I say something wrong ? If I did , I 'm awfully sorry . No . Everything you said was beautiful , sweet . Well , you see , Carla , I have n't got anyone I can talk to about you . You know , your father does n't want your name mentioned , and Sandy is jealous , and Miss Bessie ... Well , the whole town thinks I 'm a fool because I keep thinking about you , and I guess that 's why I gushed the way I did just now . I 'm awfully sorry . I was n't even polite enough to ask you what you were doing here . I came to ask a favour , but I 've changed my mind .
zone1	you came to ask me a favour ? I ca n't do it , Clay . Why not , Carla ? You can do anything you want to me . Do n't you remember when you were 15 , at your birthday , when you pushed me into the birthday cake with all your lit candles and it burned the fuzz on my face ? And then I set fire to the barber shop ? And did I get mad , Carla , when your father chased me around the square with the razor ? Carla , you 're in trouble . I could always tell when you were in trouble . Now , what 's the matter ? Clay , please . Forget I was here . But , Carla , you can trust me . I mean , if you need me , you know I 'll do anything you want . I hoped all my life I could do something for you . - Just give me a chance to prove it . - I ca n't , Clay . But I 'll do anything you say
zone1	of my children ? It 's simple . You just say , would you ... Did you really say , would you be the father of my ... Oh , Clayton ! Oh , Clayton ! Harold ! Harold ! He 's drowning , Harold . Hurry . Miss Bessie ! Miss Bessie ! Miss ... Oh , I 'm ... Miss Bessie ! Miss Bessie ! The squirt spray and the curlers at the low introductory price ... Miss Bessie , did you rent the apartment yet ? I did n't think you 'd get very far , Clayton . - When you 're loyal , you 're loyal . - Thanks a lot , Miss Bessie . And everything will be ... Yes , the old Grey hair ai n't what it used to be - Do n't delay , get Gookum Spray today - Gookum I better get out of these clothes . If I catch a cold , I 'll give it to my son . I ca n't have that happen . Let 's see now . I keep the baby until they return from
zone1	has to leave her son with me . Poor Carla 's husband . He never even saw the baby . He died the next morning , right after the honeymoon . What a way to go . What 'll I wear ? What 'll I wear ? What a nervous wreck I am . I ca n't wait for my child . You should have told him he was going to have a full house . He thought it was only one . I did n't want to scare him out . - Did you give him the money ? - He would n't take it . He said unless he did it all himself , it would n't be important . Well , the boy has character . I remember I had it once . The baby 's here . He 's here . Oh , boy . The baby ... Calm , calm . I must be calm . I got ta make believe like I 'm completely surprised , in case anybody 's watching . Oh , my heavens . A baby 's cry . Why ,
zone1	out at this hour ? I shall look . Oh , goodness , goodness . A child . Alas and alack . What would a baby be doing here ? Well , certainly ca n't stay out in the night air . Do n't cry , baby . You 'll get used to me . How does a baby cry while he 's asleep ? Twins . Your mommy did n't tell me there were two of you . Gee , I sure hope I can take care of the two of you . No . Oh , no . Do you think it ... No , it ca n't be . You guys are n't old enough to be going around knocking on doors . Nah . Just someone . Hello ? Who ? Knocking ? Hello ? Hello ? Three . One , two , three . One . God bless you . Triplets . That 's three of you and only one of me . But I 'll try . I 'll really try . Do n't cry , honey . He 'll take good care of

No , I ca n't tell you on the phone . Will you just come right over ? Oh , yeah , and Sandy , one other thing . I 'd appreciate it if you 'd stop by the drugstore and pick up some of those bottles with those rubber faucets on the end , you know ? Okay . Goodbye . Now , Sandy is on her way over with your breakfast , but just to tide you over a little bit till she gets here , I 'll warm a little snack for you , okay ? Hold it , hold it . Nice and clean , with sterilizing . Oh , hot . What a heat . What a hot heat . Got ta be clean . Got ta be a clean heat hot . Relax . Relax , kids , relax . Here it

Plenty of drinking so they get nice and strong and big . Plenty of milk for the boys . Now we have it nice . Hold it tight , and we have ... Here it comes . It 's starting out . Get set , boys .

Take a little bit . That 's good . Okay . Go ahead . That 's good . Hello ? Naturally , it 's none of my business , Mr Naples , and heaven knows I 'm not one to talk , but your daughter Sandy received a phone call from Clayton Poole . He has n't left town
zone1	How old would you say they are , Sandy ? - About two months . - They 're cute , are n't they ? Yeah . What 's the matter ? Well , now you 'll never have to get married , will you ? - What ? - Well , you always wanted children , and now you got ' em , the easy way . Yeah , well , it ai n't gon na be so easy taking care of them . Would you remind me to call Doc Simkins for their distemper shots ? - What 's so funny ? - That 's for puppies . Clayton , do n't you know anything about little girls ? Little girls ? - Are they all little girls ? - Yes . They told me while we were discussing the latest in fashion . Oh , be careful . Do n't drop him . Her . I wo n't . See , this is the first thing you learn in Home Economics , Clayton . After they eat , they 've got an awful lot of air bubbles in
zone1	them out . See how it works ? - Could I try one ? - Sure . - Here , Sandy , hold this . - Okay . Now , that 's it . Now pat her back real easy , very easy . Yeah . I 'm doing it easy . Something 's wrong with this one . It ai n't working . - They all work , Clayton . - Yeah , but I got scared . I did n't know . Say , you 're going to have to get married after all , Tiger . Is getting married all you got on your mind ? Sure , because they are n't going to let you keep them . And if you want a family , you 're still gon na have to invest in a $2 license . I 'm still a contender . And who says I ca n't keep ' em ? I found ' em . The court 's going to find a home for them . They have a home right here with me . They 'll put them with married couples
zone1	a baby for a long time . Three married couples could adopt one each . They 're not breaking up the set . They 're staying here with me . - You 're not married , Clayton . - I know that . They 're not going to let a bachelor raise three little girls . Your father was a bachelor . He raised two of them . Really , Clayton . Papa was n't a bachelor . - Sometime I wish I am . - Aw , shut it ... Hi , Papa Naples . - Come in . Come in . - I am in . I told you to keep away from him . Now , go home . Oh , Papa . Why do n't you listen to your father , Sandy ? That 's the first smart thing I ever hear you say . Bravo . Well , being a father now , I understand the problems fathers have . What do you mean ? You a father ? Well , not exactly . It 's just that ... Well , you see ... Where

Nice babies . Can I hold one ? Yeah . Take your pick . Come here , come here . Come , nice babies . Hey , Papa , look . That baby looks just like you . - Yeah ? - No , it does n't ! - Look like me , huh ? - No . That 's right , bambino does look just like me . No , the bambino do n't look like you at all , Papa . Sure she does . Bambino just look like Papa . Just look like ... Oh , Papa , wash your mind out with soap . I was in Hollywood having my teeth capped . No , no , no . Oh , no , Papa , no . Not a very original quote , but I still think he has character .

I 've never been needed before and now I have three people that need me . - They 're small , but they need me . - To be needed is a good thing , but no so good when they do n't need you . Oh , Papa , you mean Carla . But Carla needs you , Papa . It hurts . I always blame you because Carla go away , but it 's not your fault . She leave home because ... Because I am bad papa . Oh , no , do n't say that . You were n't a bad father , Papa Naples . Yes , yes , yes . I was too strict . I want to keep my Carla with me so I not be lonely . But now , I am no lonely no more
zone1	You still have Sandy . Nah , nah , nah . I am no lonely no more because maybe I feel I am gon na be a grand papa . Maybe I am grand papa already , eh ? Well , what do you ... No , well ... Oh , no , now wait a minute , Papa Naples . No , now , Sandy and I are friends , like pals and ... It 's like two fellas . There 's no things there . I mean , Sandy is my friend , platonic pal .

zone1	... - You are good boy . Carla , she get in trouble , so you take care of her . I do n't know what you mean , Papa . She can trust you , because you good boy . Good night , my sweet grandchildren . God keep you forever . - Clayton . - Yes , Papa Naples . - I sorry I call you meat head . - Oh , that 's okay . Anytime you need an old babysitter , you call me . I work for nothing . Goodbye , Mr Vulmenaylo . Sweet little girl . Was n't it ? Oh , we 're so nice and clean . Oh , how cute . On a little platter . Just like a little pheasant . Nice and tender and warm . Sweetheart ? Baby ? How do you lose a child in it ? Honey . Where 's the child ? Baby ? Where is it ? I lost a baby . I lost a whole child . What happened to the child ? Baby ? Come on , little sweets . Look
zone1	. Oh , what pretty babies . Here . Ready ? Smiling ? Here , look here . Here it is . Here it is . There you are , darling . Yeah , was that tickling ? Yes , was it ticklish ? Hello , sweetheart . Well , Clayton , I 've got to hand it to you . You 've just taken wonderful care of those babies . It 's ... Clayton . Now you 're just gon na have to take it easy , Clayton . Doc says you 're suffering from exhaustion . Personally , I think the responsibility of this job is just more than you can handle . Women are built to take such punishment , but not men . Why do n't you get smart , boy , just give ' em up ? The doctor said quiet . Clayton says that he thinks the mother is going to come back for them . That 's why he wants to keep them . I do n't think that excuse is going to hold up , Clayton . Nobody 's ever heard of
zone1	in for babies long ago . I think the judge is just going to make them wards of the court until the adoption proceedings . All right . Relax , Clayton , relax . I 'll talk to the judge . After all , as chairman of the city council , my main function is to obstruct the due process of law . Clayton says he 'll appreciate anything you can do , Mr Wright . Yeah , well , I 'll try . Just take care of yourself , mother . You heard him . He said , why do n't you get smart and give them up ? I say , why do n't you get smart and marry some delightful girl ? So when you 're married to this delightful girl , we can adopt the babies . Simple , huh , Tiger ? You mean you do n't dig my type ? I think you do . Yes , you do . You 're lying to me , Tiger . I 'm getting to you , Tiger . Your thermometer 's rising . Let me see

I am an educated man . Papa , I 'm very glad you wrote to Carla . I 'm very glad . It 's been just awful with our family all broken up like it is . Pop . - Papa , I love you very much . - Bambina Mia , I love you , too . Are there enough stamps on that letter ? If there are n't , I 'll put some more on for you , Papa . - Your caps slip . Push back . - Okay . Papa , how did you know that Carla was in Egypt ? I read in Louella Parsnip 's column . From her headdress to her sandals She 's the one who sets the style No one else can hold a candle to the White Virgin of the

Yes . It 's a little chewed up . I think
zone1	Clay and my family ? Have n't looked at it yet , but here 's a letter from Midvale . - Why , it 's from Papa . - You want me to go ? No , do n't . It 's been years . " My darling Carla . I have not write to you for long time . " " Maybe you do n't know , but Clayton , he found three bambinos " " on his front stoops . " He 's wise . He ca n't be . Clay would never tell . " Clayton , he take very good care of the beautiful bambinos " " that look like you exactly . " " Even have a beauty spot same place where you have . " You 're right . He knows . " Clayton is much better papa to bambinos than real papa . " " Much better papa than your papa . " " Clayton still work for Mr Wright , " " but even when he work , he never let bambinos out of his sight . " " Clayton works and
zone1	To take care of bambinos cost lots of money . " Clayton would not take money from me or from no one . " He works lots of extra jobs to make extra milk money . " " And Clayton works every other night for Ah Fong , " that 's the foreigner who started a laundry in the town . " Nice and quiet now . Be nice , please . That 's it . Nice and quiet . Oh , now you 're crying ? Want me to tell your father on you ? You want I should sing a song for you again ? You wo n't cry if I sing ? All right . " Clayton also works on Sundays . " " Clayton even went on the TV amateur hour " to try and make more money to buy milk for the babies . " One , two .

" The judge made him come to the courthouse . " So Clayton went there and the judge admits Clayton is a good papa , " but he is not a real mama . " Judge say , ' Clayton , the court realise " ' that you have been an excellent foster father , " ' but these children need more than that . " ' They need a mother as well , " ' a woman like Mrs Van Cleeve . " ' The Children 's Society has approved her and her husband " ' because they can give these children the normal home that they deserve . ' " But Clayton stands up and he says , ' Your Honour , sir . " ' If you want me to be a mother ,
zone1	' " But the judge , he say , " ' Clayton , I admire your unselfish devotion to these infants . " ' By no stretch of the imagination " ' can this court look upon you as a mother . ' " But Clayton , he says , ' Well , Your Honour , " ' I 'll become a mother , a real mother , if you only give me the chance . ' " So Clayton go away to prove he can be a mother . " " I take care of bambinos and Sandra help until he get back . " " In letter here you find late picture of babies and your papa . " " Much love from your loving papa who love you . " " Signed , your loving papa . " I wish I knew where Clayton went . As we all know , a healthy , happy baby does not just happen . A healthy , happy baby happens when there 's a healthy , happy mother to take care of that baby . And that 's what we
zone1	Healthy , happy and efficient mothers . I 'm so proud to see our classes filled with women who are interested in the future welfare of their children . All of you women , mothers and expectant mothers , are to be commended . I am also happy to see in our midst a member of the opposite sex who had the courage and fortitude to want to be both a father and a mother . If there were more fathers like you , Mr Poole , a woman 's work would get done . Thank you , Mrs Rogers . And now , in just about a moment , we will be on our merry way to proper child care . I hear she has the greatest theory on feeding the baby . Oh , yes . And that 's so important . Do you believe in bottle feeding or do you believe that women ... Oh , the bottle , naturally . I think that they 're so much easier to rinse out . " The Regents of University Child Care Clinic , " " on recommendation of
zone1	Child Care , award to Clayton Poole " " this diploma for the successful completion of the course in Child Care . " " Given in Chicago , this 14th day of June , 1958 . " - Continue , Clayton . - Well , that 's about all , Your Honour . As you see , I passed all the requirements of the Child Care course . And , well , this diploma is only awarded to the very best of mothers . I was first in my class for overall child care , and I placed second for formula-mixing . But I set a new record for diaper-folding , and I did everything any other woman can do . - Really , Your Honour . - Please , Mrs Van Cleeve . Yes , Your Honour . The court will recess until after lunch to review the case . - You hear back from Carla yet ? - Not yet , Papa . I do n't know why , we sent the wire yesterday . How 's Clayton doing ? The judge have his lunch . After he
zone1	the case , we do what we plan . - Oh , Papa , we ca n't do that to Clayton . - You love the bambinos , do n't you ? - Yes . Very much . - And you love Clayton , too . Papa , I 'm in loopsville over him , but he does n't dig me . Ah , dig , dig , dig . If he no dig , so we dig . - We 'll be digging Clayton 's grave . - Yeah , yeah . - I hope we hear from Carla . - Yes . Go . - Harold . - Yes ? Send this cable right away . Jim Bacon and Bob Thomas , Associated Press ? Honey , you 've had too much sun . You ca n't send this . That cable will stop anyone from legally adopting my children . Yes , and it 'll also stop your career . Being a mother is all the career I want or ever really wanted . I was a fool to leave my children and put Clayton in this

After careful review of the circumstances involved in this case , the Court finds that the infants left on the threshold of the home of Clayton Poole shall be awarded to the proper person for adoption . And the person who has all the qualifications for adopting these children is Mrs Van Cleeve . - Sandra , you are ready ? - Almost ready , Papa . Hurry . Clayton , he lose the case . - Your Honour ... - Clayton , the case is closed . But , Your Honour , please . If I could just have a couple more days , I 'm certain that the real mother will come back to get ' em . The children have been awarded to the proper parent , Clayton . I am not so sure , Judge . Oh , Clayton , darling . Darling , thank
zone1	name , but Papa found out about everything . Everything ? There was n't anything to find out about . Clayton , you and I , that night , remember ? - The moon was yellow . - I 'm yellow . I would n't do ... And then I went to Hollywood , and Carla 's doctor took care of me . Doctor ? It was no ... There was no ... It was a dentist . There was no doctor . Listen , Mr Naples , Your Honour , here . Here 's the caps to prove it . You tell me . Are those bambinos my grandchildren ? Hold on there , Gigi . What 's going on here ? I 'm the judge in this court . That 's right . You are the judge . So if you be a good boy , you can perform the marriage . Marriage ? Me , marriage ? Wait a minute . - This is all ... Wait , a marriage ... - Oh , Clayton , we 'll be so happy . Quiet ! - Clayton Poole
zone1	tell this court the truth . Are those children the grandchildren of Gigi Naples ? - Well , Your Honour , you see ... - No , I do n't see ! And I will hold you in contempt unless you answer that question honestly , Mr Poole ! Well , Your Honour , I was a Camp Fire Girl and I never lie . Yes , those babies are the grandchildren of Papa Naples . Why did you do this , Sandy ? Papa made me do it to keep anyone else from getting Carla 's babies . Carla 's ... How did you know ? Stop them ! Stop them ! Stop them ! Stop them ! - They ca n't get married . - They are married already . Right , Judge ? - That they are . - But they ca n't be . I just heard it on the newscast . The newscaster said Clayton married your daughter Carla , and the babies are Carla 's . Me married to Carla ? If this is true , Clayton , you 'll be jailed for bigamy
zone1	the first time . The Associated Press claimed that a cable received from famed screen star Carla Naples , in Egypt , reveals her secret marriage to her childhood sweetheart , Clayton Poole of Midvale , Indiana . The star also stated she is the mother of three daughters now in their father 's care . Miss Naples recently finished starring in ... The White Virgin of the Nile ? Where is that bigamist ? There he goes . After him , boys . Come back here . You 're going to jail . Sorry , ladies . Well , it 's all out in the open now . The way I see it , you 're the bullfighter 's widow , but you 're also married to Clayton Poole , except that Poole is married to your sister , as well as to you . So that should make me Clayton 's first uncle on his second wife 's side by 10% . I do n't care what they say about me . I deserve it . But where can that poor boy be hiding ? Why , he
zone1	can return them to you personally . What character . All right , easy , boys . Easy . Easy , boys . Miss Naples will give you a statement . Where 's Clayton Poole ? Is that who she 's calling ? No . She 's calling her father in Midvale . - Hello . - Papa ? Carla ? It 's you , my Carla ? I 'm at the airport . Oh , Papa , I 've made such a mess of things . No . You no make a mess . You make the big family for me to be a grand papa . You see the babies ? So beautiful . Look just like me . I have n't seen the babies , Papa . Where are they ? Clayton is there at the airport with babies . Well , I have n't seen him , Papa . You no recognise Clayton , because Clayton no look like Clayton . Because Clayton , he have to hide from police . He 's disguised ? Yes , Papa . I see her ... Him . Here
zone1	you retiring from the screen , Carla ? - I want a statement , Miss Naples . - Wait just a minute . All right , boys . I 'll give you a statement . Meet my future husband . - What ? - Talk to him . - When did this happen ? - Where 's Clay Poole ? What happened to him ? - When did you horn in ? - You and Miss Naples ? Well , you know , we agents , we are fascinating men . We do n't have to work for a living . We have time for the social graces . You sure have forgotten Carla , have n't you , Tiger ? But I wo n't forget you , and I wo n't forget the babies . - I 'll miss them , too . - You like kids ? Oh , I sure do . What 's the matter ? - I just remembered something . - What ? - You and me , we 're married . - Yeah , that 's right . Well , that makes you
zone1	husband . - That 's right . Well , what are we waiting for ? Calling Dr Glucksman . Emergency . - Clayton Poole ? - Yeah , that 's me . Yeah . I 'm him . Yeah . Can I see my wife ? How is she ? - You can see her for just a moment . - Oh , yeah . Thanks a lot . I 'm gon na see her now . Calling Dr Middleton . Come quick . Sandy ? I love you . Let 's do n't disturb her any further . Come see your family . Five ! Five ! I have five ! Five ! I have five ! Five ! Five , I have ! Five ! Five ! Five ! We have five ! Carla went to Mexico , she only had three . We have five ! I 'm better than the bullfighter . Ol ? ! Ol ? !
zone1	6333252 Oh , dear , oh , dear . - Good night , officer . - Good night , sir . ( Screams ) ( Woman ) Evening , dear . ( **25;5552;TOOLONG ) ( Driver ) Whoa , whoa . ( Carriagestops ) Thank you . He 's so charming and elegant . He has such wonderful taste . Yes , he has , when it comes to models . Now I sha n't be seeing you again . Of course you will . Just because the statue is finished that is not a reason why things should n't stay as they are . But I sha n't be posing for you anymore . Surely we are past the stage where we need an excuse to meet . We have but what about other people ? Have you ... Are you going to tell them about us ? Let 's not think of other people , hm ? Let 's think of ourselves . Excuse me a moment . Janine . This is a surprise indeed . - How are you , Georges ? - I 'm fine . And you look wonderful . Thank you . Oh ,
zone1	Bonner . - How do you do ? How do you do ? - Janine , it 's getting late . - Oh , no , we 've plenty oftime . Pierre and I are on our way to the theatre . I heard you had a reception here tonight so I asked him to bring me along first . I 'm glad you did . I was just about to show a few friends my latest sculpture . Please . Georges . This is n't my statue you 're unveiling , is it ? No . Did you ever start it ? No , I 'm afraid I left the sketches in Italy . Shall we go ? I 'm glad Mademoiselle Dubois brought you along , Doctor . Oh , thank you . I 've always wanted to see the inside ofyour place , Bonner . - It has quite a reputation . - A good one , I trust . Very . Tell me , how many patients can you accommodate at one time ? Oh , not more than 15 . I have the house next
zone1	. There is room for more but I find that the patients I get require a great deal of individual attention . - Difficult cases ? - Difficult people . Their money gives them an overblown sense oftheir own importance . - Yes , I 've met them . - Yes , I 'm sure you have . But now I think it really is time that we ... ( Clearsthroat ) Excuse me . - Well ? - No sign of him , sir . I waited till all the passengers were gone . He just was n't there . - What time is the next train ? - In about six hours , sir . All right . Make sure you meet it . Yes , sir . I am extremely sorry to have kept you waiting . I would like to say at this stage that any credit due for what you are about to see should be laid at the feet of my charming young model . An artist can not form a thing of beauty unless he has a thing of beauty from which to
zone1	for me to do except to throw myself on your mercy . - ( Man ) A most wonderful likeness . - ( Woman ) Yes , is n't it ? Oh , Dr Bonner . But it 's ... - It 's ... - A very fine piece of work , Bonner . - Thank you very much . - It 's extremely beautiful . You would n't be interested in selling it , I suppose ? You can see I still have to cast it . Anyway , sculpting is something I do for my own pleasure . Having not yet reached the perfection I seek , I find it quite impossible to give up the completed work , so I 'll keep it . - Oh ? Where ? - Oh , not here . Somewhere I can go occasionally to look at it and ... be reminded of my beautiful young model . - Are you feeling all right ? - Yes , yes , of course . It 's just that I think we ought to go , Pierre . - Would you mind getting
zone1	... a remarkably fine sculptor , Bonner , do n't you think ? Yes , very fine . I wanted to buy it but he was n't interested . Says he always keeps his stuff when he 's finished . - Really ? - Yes . I wonder where ... Hello ! What 's this ? I thought there 'd be something else here somewhere . Mm , a torso . Oh , yes ! Oh , yes , a very beautiful woman she must have ... Terribly sorry . Very clumsy of me . Your cloak , Janine . Thank you , Pierre . You are leaving ? We are already late for the theatre . I hope you have a very pleasant evening . Yes ? What is it , Roger ? It 's half past six , sir . Already ? Are you sure ? - Yes , sir . I 've checked with two clocks . - My watch says ten past . It must be slow , sir . The time is definitely half past six . I need a new watch . I need
zone1	ask you to leave now . You all know that my main duty is the care of my patients . Their needs must come before everything else . I would like to thank you all for coming here and ... and I must apologise if I seem rude by bringing this party to so ... to so sudden a close . Strange fellow , Bonner . Did you know him well when you were in Italy ? - Why ? - Oh , I do n't know . It was just that he did n't seem too anxious to see you again . Yes , it did seem that way , did n't it ? Well , apparently it does n't worry you very much . No . No , it does n't . Oh , it was beautiful , Dr Bonner , but beautiful . - Thank you very much . - Good night . Ifyou change your mind about selling any ofyour stuff , do let me know . Good night . It has been my pleasure , I assure you . What time is it ? -
zone1	Thank you . Tell Roger , if he has any news for me when he gets back from meeting the train he can come and wake me . - Whatever the time is . - Very good , sir . - Good night . - Good night , sir . ( Gasps ) - I thought you had gone . - I want to talk to you . - Nobody knows I 'm here . - I 'm sorry but you must go . But I must talk to you , Georges . Not now , later . - I 'm very busy . - Not later , now . I want to know what 's going to happen to us , Georges . Look , Margo , I 'll talk to you tomorrow . It 's Janine Dubois , is n't it ? You 're in love with her . - Please leave . - I 'm not leaving . Ifyou think you can just forget me you 're mistaken . I wo n't let you . You ca n't ! You know I love you . You made
zone1	You made me humiliate myself . I 'm not going to step aside so you can be with someone else . Get out . Get out ! Your eyes . What 's the matter with your eyes ? All right , Georges . We 'll talk about it tomorrow . Georges ? - I 'm sorry . - Too late . Too late . Margo . I tried to make you go . I tried ... very hard . (
zone1	knock_at_door ) Wait a moment . Yes ? Hello , Georges . I saw the statue last night . Why did you lie to me ? Why did n't you want me to know that you 'd started work on it ? Why did you start work on it ? I like to finish what I start . Oh . Is that why you ran away from me in Italy ? Is that what you call finishing what you start ? My holiday was over . I came back to work . - So suddenly ? - Yes , so suddenly . There was a case . It was urgent
zone1	. I waited for you to write to me . Then I realised that if I ever wanted to see you again I had to be the one to make the first move . Why ? Why are you so afraid of loving me , Georges ? I watched you towards the end ofthe holiday in Italy and you were like a man heading towards something which he wanted to avoid . I began to think that I 'd won and that you were going to admit to yourselfthat you really loved me . Was I right ? All right , Janine . I did fall in love with you in Italy . This could not be so I left . - Why could n't it be ? - It just couldn't . - But you knew how I felt about you ? - Yes , I knew . And you still ran away from it . I 'm not going to give up so easily , Georges . Oh , tell me you do n't want me to give up . No , I do n't ... Oh ,
zone1	statue again ? Yes . Yes , of course . It 's very lovely . It 's you who are lovely . I only copied . Is it finished ? Nearly . Would you like to pose for me again ? When ? Now . You still have n't accepted that we love each other . Yes , I have . But it does n't make you happy . That 's because it does n't alter things . - What things ? - Oh , the ... the impossibility ofthe situation . (
zone1	knock_at_door ) Come in . The gentleman 's downstairs , sir . Ludwig ! Oh , please excuse me , Janine . I have been waiting so long for Ludwig to arrive . You 'll understand . Ludwig ! Let me ... look at you . Oh ... it is so good to see you . That 's good . You look wonderful . Just the same . I was worried . - Worried ? - Because I am late . I ... I knew you ... you would n't let me down . You have found
zone1	we 'll talk about that later , Ludwig . - Are n't you forgetting something ? - Yes , of course , our little ceremony . I have n't been too well . It has affected my memory also , I think . Ah , you have not forgotten how to live . What is the point of what one is doing ifyou do n't enjoy life , what it offers ? What is the point , as you say ? The ... The usual toast . - Ludwig , your hand . - Oh , yes , my hand . - Let me have a look at it . - No , it 's not necessary . I had a stroke . That is why I was not here sooner . It has left me with this legacy . - Why did n't you let me know ? - I was frightened to . I hoped you would have found the answer by now . - You have not found it , Georges ? - No . No , I have n't found the answer . The operation is
zone1	With your left hand . - No . We must find someone else . - But that is not possible . - Well , try . We always knew if we did n't find the ultimate solution there would have to be another surgeon someday . - The stroke might have killed me . - But it did n't . Three weeks I have been waiting , Ludwig . Three weeks ! I have been taking this fluid every six hours now . Six ? It is what keeps me alive . So you see , you must operate . You ... you know what will happen ifyou do n't . Yes , I know . You will die . You 're old . You can see death staring you in the face . But I ca n't ... I 'm not going to die . Then you must find someone else to do the operation . But who ? Who can we get ? We need a young surgeon , that 's all . Just a surgeon . We tell him just enough to satisfy him and I 'll
zone1	operation . That 's the best way , Georges . For the first time I 'll be with him to show him what to do . Next time , ifyou still need the operation , I sha n't be here . I 'll be dead . Find someone else ? Huh . It 's easy to say . - There is so little time . - You are a doctor . You must have met other doctors , someone who will do it . (
zone1	knock_at_door ,
zone1	door_opens ) Mademoiselle Dubois is leaving , sir . Janine . I 'm terribly sorry , Janine . Let me introduce you to my oldest and dearest friend , Ludwig Weiss . Ludwig , this is Mademoiselle Janine Dubois . It is delightful to meet you , my dear . How do you do , Professor ? I 'm sure that you have a lot to talk to the professor about so I 'll say goodbye . - Goodbye , my dear . - I 'll see you at dinner . Janine , why not bring Gerard along this evening ? - Pierre
zone1	of Vienna is here . I 'm sure he would love to meet him . I thought we were going to be on our own tonight . Ludwig is here only for a few days . We 'll have so much time together . Oh , Georges , you do n't know what it means to me to see you again . It means everything to me . This Monsieur Pierre , is he a doctor ? Even better , a surgeon . And ... do you think he 'll do it ? If he 's convinced that you give the operation your blessing , then he 'll do it . Why should he be influenced by what I do ? Ludwig ... Ludwig , you 're still the same . You just can not accept the fact that you are a great man . One ofthe greatest in your own field . There is no medical man in the world who would miss the chance of meeting you , let alone work with you . Half of what makes up this reputation belongs to you , more than half
zone1	does . Listen , Georges . Why not tell them ? Publish our findings . Please , Ludwig , allow me to decide when to publish . Probably you are right . You have invested more in this than I have . Yes , indeed . Nevertheless , I probably sha n't be here to see the consequences . I am tired , Georges . As you said just now , I can see death staring me in the face . I 'm sorry , Ludwig . Believe me , I did n't mean it that way . Strange , getting old . One suddenly has no future to look forward to and is forced to look back and ... survey the past . Do you remember our original toast , the first time we knew we had succeeded ? Of course I do . Say it . - For humanity . - That 's right . For humanity . Not for me , not for you , Georges , but for all . I know what it means . Do you , Georges ? Sometimes I wonder a little
zone1	. That is hardly surprising . I 'm talking about our original ideas , bright , shining ideas , full of hope for a brave new world . What happened to them ? Where did they get lost ? Why ... Why do you say they are lost ? I think they are . The years have brought me an added insight that enables me to see more clearly - the fact ... - Wait a minute , Ludwig . You are forgetting something , are n't you ? I 'm sorry , I do n't understand . - Do you still have that photograph ? - Photo ... photograph ? - Our photograph . - Ah , yes , of course . - Give it to me . - Mm ... Look at it , Ludwig . And what do you see there ? I see the two of us . - As we were at the beginning . - Exactly . So , remember , when you talk ofthis wisdom and this insight that old age has brought to you , remember I too have this wisdom and
zone1	89 . 89 . Have another look . Let it remind you , while you have the wisdom that comes with a life of 89 years , I have that which comes with a life of ... 104 . Yes , sir , I know what you 're saying is possible but it 's not proven . ( Chuckles ) Proven ! If we doctors waited until something is proven before we moved , there 'd be no patients left . They 'd all be dead . Look , I have seen it done in three different ways , none of_them completely effective . - The first is to make an ingress through ... - Ludwig . Just a moment , Georges . An ingress through ... Ludwig , why not take Dr Gerard down to the study ? - It will be so much easier down there . - Yes , of course . Come on . Come on , Dr Gerard . - You 'll excuse us ? - Oh , of course they will . Come on . I 'll get pencil and paper to show you
zone1	incision must be made directly ... Pierre seems very interested in your Professor Weiss . Yes , I told you he would gladly come once you mentioned Professor Weiss of Vienna . He 's a wonderful old man . Have you known him long ? All my life . We ... used to work together . A long time ago . That makes you sound very old . Janine , I ca n't tell you how much it means to me to have you back . I missed you so much . You need n't have . You know that . Yes . Yes , I knew . Georges , you still have n't told me why you tried to avoid falling in love with me . You started telling me something this morning but you never finished it . Because I had to go away . Because I have to go away again . Go away ? Where ? Where is not important . What matters is that I shall have to leave Paris very soon . But you 'll come back ? No . Why ? I ca
zone1	stand there and tell me you 're going away and never coming back without giving me an explanation . My work makes it necessary . Because you 're a doctor ? Yes , partly . I have to travel where no one has ever been before . I want to lift the curtain of life and see what lies beyond . To do this it is necessary for me to go away . Is it necessary for you to go alone ? All right , you 've convinced me but it 's not something I 'd care to try . Ah , you lack the spirit ofthe pioneer , Dr Gerard . Being a surgeon is a practical business . It 's necessary to make a living . It does n't leave much time for pioneering . But ifyou had the opportunity of becoming one ofthe pioneers by performing one simple operation , what would you say then , huh ? First I 'd say that no operation is simple . Then I 'd want to know what this operation involved . If it were impossible to explain it ,
zone1	I should have to say no . Regardless of who was talking to you ? Professor Weiss , when we started this conversation I was under the impression that we were speaking hypothetically . Are we ? No . We are not . I see . I suppose I should be annoyed at this verbal subterfuge . I do n't know why I 'm not , really . Look , suppose you tell me just exactly what it was you asked me here for . See this ? My right hand . The one I would have used if I were going to operate . I came here for one single reason . To save the life of Georges Bonner . - What ? - Yes . By performing an operation that only I know how to perform . You see ? I ca n't do it . Therefore , I am asking you to take my place . This operation , Dr Weiss , what exactly does it involve ? In spite of what you said , this one is really simple . It involves the removal ofthe uter-parathyroid
zone1	Bonner 's life . I have n't finished . To remove the gland and substitute an alternative . An alternative ? Why ? Is it necessary to know the reason just to perform an operation ? Physically , no , but morally , I think so . Would you be prepared to leave the protection ofyour morals in my hands ? I ... I 'm not sure . Look at it this way . I am asking you to perform a very simple , straightforward operation and I am guaranteeing to you there can be no ill effects . On the contrary , unless this operation is done , and very soon , Georges Bonner ... will die . I agree that the operation is simple . I would n't exactly call it straightforward . - It 's never been done before . - Actually , I 've done it myself many times . - You 've done it ? - Mm . There are no moral or legal aspects involved . I suppose not , as long as the patient is willing . He is willing . - You
zone1	will . - And will you lend your name to this ? - Mm . Very well , I 'll do it . Good . Now , come on . I 'll show you what 's to be done . Thank you . This is Georges Bonner 's laboratory , where we will do the operation . Would n't it be better in a theatre next door to the clinic ? No , no , it 's better here . We do n't want people to know the doctor is sick . It 's bad for the morale ofthe patients . ( Chuckles ) - That 's a fine piece of work , is n't it ? - Mm-hm . Oh , Georges , I love you so much . And I love you . I 've tried not to . I 've tried very hard . Is it so bad now you 've given up the struggle ? I do n't think I could have let you go . I 'm not going to let you , ever . ( Ludwig ) Georges , Dr Gerard must go now
zone1	. I think you 'd better let Gerard take you home . Whatever you say , Georges . It 's been a very great honour to meet you . My colleagues will be most impressed . Please , Dr Gerard , I must ask you not to mention our meeting . You see , I am old and tired . if_the medical fraternity knew I was here , they would request lectures , addressed meetings . Oh , you understand of course . As you wish . I 'm sorry about this , Bonner , but I have to go back to the hospital . - Thank you for coming . - Not at all . - Will you see me home first , Pierre ? - Yes , of course . (
zone1	doorbell_rings ) - Dr Bonner , please . - Yes ? I am Inspector Legris ofthe Surete . I wonder if I could have a word with you . Of course , Inspector . Come in . Thank you . - Evening , Mademoiselle , Messieurs . - ( All ) Evening . - We were just
zone1	. Do n't leave on my account . Oh , we can wait a few more moments , ca n't we , Pierre ? - Come into the study , Inspector . - Thank you . - Sit down , please . - Thank you . What can I do for you , Inspector ? Just a couple of questions , sir . Routine . Relating to what ? Relating to the apparent disappearance of a young lady , one Margo Philippe . Did you say Margo ? But that 's impossible . - You do know the young lady , then ? - Oh , yes . Yes , of course I do . - When did you last see her ? - Yesterday . I had a small reception here and she was the guest of honour . You ... you met her here , did n't you ? Oh , yes , the young lady you modelled . Yes . Did you see her leave ? I think so . Why , yes . Yes , I 'm sure I did . What 's happened to her
zone1	sir . She has just disappeared . It seems the last time she was seen was here at your reception . But that 's terrible . What could have happened ? Quite a number ofthings could have happened , Mademoiselle , and it 's up to me to find out the one that did . This statue you did of her , could I see it ? - Why ? - I understand it 's an excellent likeness . As I have never seen the young lady it would help me in my investigations if I knew what she looked like . I ... I 'm afraid , Inspector , I no longer have the statue . But I just ... Yes , Monsieur ? You were going to say ? Nothing , nothing at all . It does n't matter . Perhaps you can tell me who does have it . Nobody . A stupid accident this morning . It was broken . I was touching up a section ofthe plinth and I knocked the whole thing over . I 'm afraid it was smashed to pieces . I
zone1	Monsieur . That will be all for the moment . You will let me know ifthere 's any news ? - I 'll let you know . - Thank you . - Good night , Inspector . - Good night , sir . - And thank you . - Not at all . - What could have happened to her ? - You know the statue is in the laboratory ? - Yes . Yes , I do . - He only wanted to look at it . He would have wanted to take it away with him . I know how the police mind works and , I 'm afraid , I know myself . It 's probably very silly of me but ... I simply can not part with my sculptures . I see your point . Well , thank you for the dinner , Bonner . Janine . Good night , Professor . - Good night , Gerard . - Good night . - Well ? - He 'll do it . Oh , good . What happened to the girl ? When is he going to
zone1	talking to you , not the policeman . What happened to her ? What is the matter with you , Ludwig ? I will tell you what 's the matter with me . Ten years ago when I came to London to do the operation a girl you modelled just disappeared and was never seen again . Ten years before that another ofyour models just disappeared . Two could be a coincidence . Three can not . What have you done to her ? You 're very tired , Ludwig . So am I . You should go to bed . I 'm not tired , I 'm frightened . Frightened for you , what you might have done . Good night , Ludwig . - When is he going to operate ? - Tomorrow morning . I thought I told you to go to bed . Are you going to take another dose ofthe fluid ? You 'd better go to bed , unless you want to see what happens when the dose is overdue . I have been examining the gland . - What about it ? -
zone1	? Oh , do n't distress yourself . It will do what is wanted of it . - I am not referring to that . - Then what are you referring to ? This gland is not like the others . It was taken from a ... from a living body . - You 're talking nonsense , Ludwig . - Do n't tell me nonsense . I am not such a senile old fool that I have forgotten the difference between a revitalised and a living organ . This gland has been taken from a living body . All right , Ludwig . As you say , it was taken from a living body . But it was because ofyou that I had to do it . Now it 's my turn to say " nonsense " . You were due here three weeks ago . As always , I had a uter-parathyroid ready . As always , I had removed it and revitalised it , but ... you did n't arrive . I managed to keep that gland revitalised for four days . Then another one . Four
zone1	have them die , and still you did n't arrive . I just ... I just could n't get access ... to any more cadavers . No . Oh , no , this ... This was the only answer . The answer for whom ? For you ? Or for the poor man you have murdered ? But I 'm sorry . It was my fault , was n't it ? You had to do it because of me . No , Georges . I ca n't see how this can be justified . You would rather I had not been able to get a gland at all . You would rather this was the end . Is that what you would have liked ? Yes . It is . Knowing how it would happen you still say that ? But I 'm not afraid of death . If I were , I too could have remained young . Do you remember how we talked about it and you tried to persuade me ? But what is death that it should be feared so much ? You do n't know
zone1	I am saying . Why should the death ofthe other man be of less importance than your own death ? By what right can you decide a thing like this ? This is a thing that only God can decide . Have you become God all of a sudden , to judge that you are more important than the other man ? Of course I 'm more important . He was nothing , nothing at all . A nonentity . He had just as much right to life as you have , more perhaps , because he did n't attempt to tamper with the progression of life . While you are on this pedestal of moral indignation you seem to have forgotten that you are as involved as I am . No . I do not forget . That is perhaps because I am so sad . I am sad for you too . You have changed so much . I 'll tell you why I have changed . It 's being alone , so utterly alone , again and again . Every few years having to sever all contacts
zone1	a new life . You knew this would be the case when you set out . Knowing something and living with it are are two very different things . I often think I ca n't bear it any longer . Georges ? We have come to a time where we must consider with great care whether what we are doing should continue . No , let me say what I have to . No man can live alone all his life . It 's not natural . It rebels against human nature . But as long as you continue you must remain alone . No . No , there is an answer . Not to continue . No , to continue . But not to continue alone . Georges , you 're not being serious . Of course I 'm serious . Do you think I 've never thought about it ? This must be the answer . Georges . What you are suggesting is monstrous . But why ? Why is it monstrous to want to be with the person you love , always ? Mademoiselle Janine ? It
zone1	I will not hear of it and I must ask you to promise me now not to consider it again . I can not promise that . Then you are truly alone now . For I will have nothing more to do with it . Ludwig . No , Georges , you must n't do it . Do n't be stupid , Ludwig . Give me that key . Give me that key . It is past time already . Yes , Georges , it 's been many years past time . Ludwig , that key , quickly . All right , I promise . Now , give me that key . You 're lying . I can see it in your eyes . You are lying to save yourself . Give me that key ! Ludwig . Look . Please . No . It is better that it end here before further damage is done . This must be the end . No , you must ... You must n't do it . You fool ! This ... - This is all I 've got . - Yes ,
zone1	two years to make a fresh supply . No , no . No , do n't . Do n't do it . ( Screams ) (
zone1	knock_at_door ) Dr Gerard , sir . Oh . - Good morning , Dr Gerard . - Good morning . Everything is ready , including the patient . Where is Dr Weiss ? Oh , I 'm afraid he had to leave late last night . He received an urgent message from his home in Vienna . He asked me to ... to apologise on his behalf . Monsieur Bonner . Without Dr Weiss it is out ofthe question for me to perform this operation . Last night you agreed . The Doctor 's reputation is such that under his patronage I agreed to do it , but if he is not here , it 's ... it 's impossible . You must or I shall die . I recommend you to see another doctor . Wait . - I 'll pay you well . - That 's of no consequence , Monsieur . Ifyou are in the critical condition that you say you
zone1	reputable hospital immediately . It 's possible that they may be able to do for you what I can not do . Good day . - (
zone1	knock_at_door ) - Come in . Inspector Legris to see you , sir . Oh , yes . Show him in . Good morning , sir . - I hope you 'll forgive this intrusion . - Morning . - Please sit down . - Thank you . - What can I do for you ? - This is a little difficult , sir . Are you a particular friend of Monsieur Georges Bonner ? No , I 'm not . I only met him for the first time the day before yesterday . Then there 's not much you can tell me about him . No . When we met last night I received the impression that you wanted to say something . Yes , that 's quite correct , Inspector . Remember that statue that he said was broken ? Well , he did n't break it . It 's in his laboratory . That 's strange . I take it
zone1	No , sir , we have n't . And you think Bonner knows something that will help you ? I do n't know what to think . The deeper I get into this case , the more complicated and unreasonable it becomes . Unreasonable , Inspector ? How old would you say Monsieur Bonner was ? - About 35 . - Yes , that 's what I would have said . Why do you ask that ? Look , sir , I need your help , I do n't mind admitting it . - To find this girl ? - No , it goes deeper than that . Far deeper . I 'm going to tell you something and then perhaps you may be able to give me the help that I need . Please do . Ten years ago in London a young woman disappeared , later presumed to have been murdered . That 's not very interesting , you 'll say . It happens all the time . Well , exactly ten years before that the same thing happened in San Francisco and ten years before that ,
zone1	Then , two years ago , the international files at the Surete were being tabulated . A fact was noticed that tied these three disappearances together and pointed towards them all having been perpetrated by one man . In each case the girl in question had been posing for a statue prior to her disappearance . In each case the sculptor was a doctor . And in each case the doctor disappeared shortly after . All this is carrying coincidence too far . You see what I 'm getting at , do n't you , sir ? Yes . I see what you 're trying to get at . But if Bonner is the man you suspect , sir , - he 'd be over 60 by now . - Yes . That 's where the whole thing becomes unreasonable . You said yourselfthat he was about 35 , certainly not more than 38 , and I agree with you . I assume you have n't said anything to Bonner about this ? What 's the point ? These statues ofthe women who disappeared , - were they ever found
zone1	statues were seen by a small number of close friends ofthe sculptor and remarkably fine pieces of work they were too by all account . Then they were never seen again . How can I help you , Inspector ? Well , as you 've met Monsieur Bonner , I had hoped that you might be able to give me a lead . I have checked his background thoroughly . His movements seem all perfectly normal as far as I can trace back . And then I reach a complete dead end . How far back before you reach this dead end ? Ten years . Look , I think I may be able to give you some sort of lead . It may not mean anything but it 's worth a try . See what you can find out about Professor Ludwig Weiss . - You 've heard of him , of course ? - Weiss ? Vaguely . - He 's a doctor , is n't he ? - He was one ofthe very greatest . He was at Bonner 's house last night . You saw him
zone1	London , San Francisco and Bern at the time that those girls disappeared . You do n't think Professor Weiss could have been responsible ? No , I do n't , not directly . But you will try ? Dr Gerard , I 'll try anything . Needless to say , you wo n't say a word about this to anyone , will you ? Naturally not , Inspector , if_that is your wish . Thank you . I do n't know your reasons for wanting me to do this , Monsieur Dumont , but whatever they are , I must decline . I 'm sorry . But you 're not making sense , Pierre . You come here with a story which you admit is mostly guesswork and you expect me to believe it . All I 'm trying to do is to warn you against Georges Bonner . I gathered that , but you still have n't explained why . I ca n't give you all the details until I am sure of_them myself . But ... the man 's abnormal . For heaven 's sake , Pierre
zone1	asked me to perform an operation on Bonner . I agreed , and today Weiss is n't there anymore . Well ? What 's so mysterious about that ? By itself , nothing , but added to other things that I have discovered ... Oh , not that idiotic story about those statues again . I 've never heard anyone talk such nonsense in all my life . I admit it does sound far-fetched . That is why I want you to wait ... until I can get more information . Spy on him . That 's what you mean , do n't you ? You came to make an impression upon me with your story about Georges . Well , you 've done that . But it was about you and not Georges that you made the impression . You are jealous of him . You 're jealous of his work and about me . Well , I love him . And I 'm going to marry him . It 's unusual , Monsieur Dumont . You will grant me that . So is the fee I am offering
zone1	, then . When is it to be ? I , er ... I think I could manage next Tuesday . It is to be now , tonight , and at my place . Very well , then . I 'll put my things together . One needs many instruments for an operation . What 's this ? This is a scalpel , Monsieur Dumont . You could n't be expected to know what that is but to us doctors it is the principal instrument , like a spade is to a farmer , you know . And just about as filthy too . Leave all this . I have all the equipment you need . You have ? Very well . I always have a small one before I operate . My hand is not as steady as it was , you know . Wait for me . Oh ... Oh , Janine . I 'm sorry to have kept you waiting . I hope you do n't mind my coming here like this . No , of course not . I was looking for you all afternoon .
zone1	- I have been busy . Janine , there is something I must tell you . I ... Georges , are you ill ? No , no , of course not . - Why ? - Oh , it 's just that ... Pierre was here earlier this afternoon . He said something about an operation . He 's got some fantastic story in his mind about you and Professor Weiss . What sort of story ? Oh , it 's too ridiculous for words . Something to do with glands and statues . I really did n't know what he was talking about . Darling ? - Are you sure you 're not ill ? - No , of course not . I 'm just tired . Yes , just tired . I was so worried about you this afternoon , thinking you were ill and not knowing where you were . - Janine ... - Yes ? - Would you do something for me ? - Anything in the world . Then come with me . Georges , what a strange place . - Is it yours ?
zone1	it doing here ? I 'll ... I 'll explain in a minute . I love you . But it 's simply wonderful . So many beautiful things . - It must have taken years to do . - Yes , yes , a long time . Wait , I 'll ... I 'll show you something . This is the very first thing I ever did . I was 12 . It 's charming . 1798 ? Oh , Georges , you 've got the wrong date on this . Ifyou modelled this when you were 12 then this date makes you ... 104 . Georges ? Georges ! Yes , I heard what you said . 104 . I do n't believe it . Whether you believe it or not is of no importance . It is important that you do this operation . My answer is the same as before , Bonner . No . Wait a minute , Gerard . Listen to me once more . Then we 'll see ifyou feel the same afterwards . Weiss and I ... were fellow students . I was
zone1	- Yes , his senior . I met him when I returned to university for a refresher course on surgery . Quite by accident we discovered we were interested in the same line of research . And then ... finally we discovered the secret of immortal life . But we had to prove what up till then had been only theory . So ... I volunteered to be the first guinea pig . Since I embarked on this experiment , I have never been ill , never had a blemish on my skin . Sickness and disease have passed me by . So you see , not only did we discover the secret of perpetual life , but of perpetual health as well . Then why did n't you publish your findings ? We have n't published because to do so would bring disaster . The balance of nature is such that the population ofthe world is kept at a level where the world can adequately provide food and living space for our people . If it were suddenly made possible for people to remain alive and healthy indefinitely the
zone1	the population ofthe earth would be doubled , then quadrupled . There would be famine on a scale never before dreamed of . This is one reason we have n't published . - One reason ? - Yes . There is another . Every ten years it is necessary to have the uter-parathyroid replaced . In order to replace an organ you must first find a replacement . With no one dying there would be no replacement . You told me earlier on about a fluid that you have to take to keep alive . Only in the latter stages of each ten-year cycle . If , for any reason , the operation is delayed , it is possible to remain alive for four weeks by taking this fluid . Not desirable , for it has an unpredictable effect on the mental balance . And you have none ofthis fluid left ? Enough to keep me alive for another six hours . I shall become the inheritor of all my 104 years , of all the sickness I have never had , of every pain , blemish , disease ,
zone1	is why you must perform this operation . I 'm sorry , Bonner , but I still ca n't do it . Why not ? Tell me why not . You are asking me to participate in an offence against nature . You said so yourself . An offence against God . Nothing you can say will make me change my mind . You 're in love with Janine , are n't you ? Yes , I am . You would n't like anything to happen to her ? What do you mean ? At this moment Janine is somewhere only I know . Ifyou perform this operation and perform it successfully , I shall release her . Ifyou do n't perform this operation , or if anything should happen to me while you are operating , Janine will not be seen by you or anyone else again . You have two hours to verify the facts . Then I shall expect you at my house . Two hours . Remember . Here you are , dearie . Drink it up . Why ? What 's the hurry ? No
zone1	a working girl , remember . Time is money after all . You 'll get paid so stop nagging . (
zone1	door_opens ) Cognac . I 'm sick of waiting here for you to fill your great fat stomach . - I 'm going . - What are you doing ? What about ... What , do you think I 'm a girl who can be bought for money ? - I 've never been so insulted . - You said 50 francs . It is n't safe for a respectable girl to be around on her own . My escort 's here now , anyway . ( Catscreeches ) Mind the dustbins , dear . (
zone1	woman_screams ) (
zone1	doorbell_rings ) Never mind , Roger . You go to bed . Yes , sir . Good evening . Everything is ready . Please . If I perform this operation you will release Janine immediately ? I give you my word . It will be extremely unfortunate if I do n't survive this operation . ( Trainpassing ) (
zone1	woman_laughing ) No ! No , no ! Drink this .
zone1	your gratitude best by taking me to Janine Dubois . Of course . You 'll be strong enough to do that by the time I 'm ready . It means nothing to you that you saved me from an extremely horrible death ? Nothing . Try getting up and moving around a little . How does it feel ? I said , how does it feel ? - Did you see Bonner go out ? - No . I heard him , though . - Have you any idea where he went ? - No , sir , I have n't . Find Inspector Legris and bring him here . - Yes , sir . - And hurry . It 's desperately urgent . ( Trainpassing ) ( Gruntingandgroaning ) - Where have you been ? - Later . Come on . You said you wanted to be with me . Always . - Is that still true ? - Yes . Yes . Whatever it may mean ? Whatever it may mean , yes . Janine , I 'm going to tell you about myself . It all started
zone1	papers . Never mind that . You leave this to me . Now , then , sir . What 's the matter ? Bonner has abducted Janine Dubois . He 's hidden her . Wait a minute , sir . Please will you start at the beginning ? Earlier this evening Bonner came to see me . He asked me to perform an operation on him . This has been my ... existence . Not life , existence . Until I met you . Now you 're going to come with me , Janine . But first you must become exactly as I am . Think of it . Never to grow old , always to stay as we are , as we are now , never to be ill . To stay as beautiful as you are now . - No . - Always . Through all time . And this fluid affected his reason ? For the few moments before taking it he became without reason at all . Homicidal , completely mad . That 's when he killed those three women . - And at other times
zone1	, intelligent . Here 's a carrier 's receipt . " Unspecified crate , 3x2x2 , collect at this address , " deliver to railway arches , Gare du Nord . " Today 's date . The statue . It was here yesterday . It 's gone now . We must try it . It 's the only clue we 've got . If what you say is correct then he must be all right now that you 've performed the operation . I made the incision but I did not perform the operation . It will be all right , I promise you . - No , no ! - Janine ! No ! He did n't . He did n't do the operation . He did n't do the operation ! ( Groaning ) ( Secondwomanlaughs ) I am going to die . ( Screaming ) - Janine ! She 's in there . - What ? Break that door down quickly . Get out of here . (
zone1	woman_screams ) ( Bonnerscreams )
zone1	3838558 - Weinkoop , where is she ? - In this car , sir . - Has she recovered consciousness ? - Not yet . - This is the company doctor . - Follow me . - Come on . Five minutes out of Port Johnson she went into the ladies ' room . - Must 've finished off a pint . - The telegram said she fell . Rolled off the seat like a sack of flour . - Well ? - She 's dead drunk . My report can say something else , but that 's what it is . Belongs in a hospital . Anything to get her off company property . Come on , Doc . Have her taken to the Jefferson Hospital . You go with her . Be sure you make it straight we 're not taking any responsibility . We 're doing this only as a courtesy to her husband . Put her in a private room under another name . Keep her there until I get Sam Eaton to come take her home . Very well , Mr Jones . There 's more to running a railroad than just laying down some
zone1	usual ? - As usual . You wo n't find any around here . They 're all down on Market Street . - Nobody left on that train ? - No , just the crew . I wonder if ... Oh , no . Not Martha Eaton . See you later . This is DD Jones . I want you to put in a long-distance call to Port Johnson . To Mr Samuel Eaton . That 's right , Eaton Iron and Steel . Will you be home for dinner , Mr Eaton , if anyone should ask ? If you mean by " anyone " Mrs Eaton , say so , Nellie ... or forever hold your peace . Well , what with Mr . Alfred coming home from the war today . You 're sure it 's today , are you ? Maybe you even know what time he 's coming . Or how he 's coming . No reason a servant should n't know more than his own family . Those eggs were too hard again today , Nellie . - When I say soft-boiled , I
zone1	may be home . Then again , I may not . - And now I 'm off . Goodbye , Nellie . - Goodbye , sir . Hello . Eaton residence . Oh , I 'm sorry . He just left . You should be able to reach him at the mill in about 10 minutes . You 're welcome . Goodbye . Mrs Eaton got out of the house mighty early this morning , George . - Yes , sir . - Philadelphia again ? I did n't wait to see which train she took , sir . Did n't she say anything ? We were too busy talking about your boy coming home safe from the navy to talk about unimportant matters . In other words , Mrs Eaton 's whereabouts are too unimportant for me to have any interest in them . There 's nothing about Mrs Eaton that 's unimportant . Not to me , sir . Are you trying to say something to me , George ? Well , sir , I made me a promise the day your son went away . " George
zone1	comes home from this war , you 'll say some things that 's been wanting to be said . " Took a lot for granted , did n't you ? I knew he was coming back . I prayed for him . Prayed ? You 're no more of a praying man than I am . If it was Billy gone to war instead of Alfred , maybe you 'd have learned to pray , Mr Eaton . Is that what you promised yourself to say ? A father can feel badly over a son dead 13 years without ignoring the other one . - Do n't preach to me , George . - No , sir . - Maybe you 'd better be taking the day off . I 'll accept the day 's holiday , sir , but after that , I do n't want to work for you anymore . No , I should n't think you would . - I 'll have your check ready for you tomorrow morning . - Yes , sir . You might as well stop in front of the saloon ,
zone1	where you 'll be going anyway , I 'm sure . Here 's to Samuel Eaton , president of Eaton Iron and Steel , who , after 20-some odd years of being dirty , rotten mean to his boy Alfred has just been fired . I said fired , Noony , by his own chauffeur . I 'll drink to that . And here 's to Alfred Eaton , who never did anything wrong in his whole life , except be the son who did n't die of spinal meningitis , when he was a kid . And now I hope he 'll be forgiven for living through the war . You know where North Hill Road is ? - Hey , Jake . Got a passenger for out of town . - Good . - Do n't you want to help me with my bags ? - Who says so ? - How much do I owe you ? - 3 dollars . - Oh , yeah ? Who says so ? - I said so . 3 dollars . - Wait here while I go in and telephone
zone1	out when they raised their prices . - 2 dollars . - Here 's one dollar . Now , beat it before I pull you out of that cab and bust your nose for you . - Well , big man . Mr . Alfred . Hello , Josephine . Hello , Nellie . - Stop , Nellie , for the Lord 's sake . - I ca n't help it . Well , you all look fine . - Come on , now . Turn around , Josephine . - I will not . You do n't have to . I can see it 's getting bigger . - It is not . - She do n't have her corset on . Shut your mouth , for the Lord 's sake . I brought you two old crows some presents from London . You did n't have to spend your money on us . - We 're just thankful you 're home . - I 'll bet you are , too . You did n't tell a soul what time you were coming . I did n't want to
zone1	are n't really ready for you what with the mister and missis away . - Away ? Tonight I have only lamb chops , but I did make apple pie . Where did they go ? The missis went away this morning . I do n't know where . The mister called this afternoon . It sounded like long distance . He said , " Do n't wait with dinner . " We fixed for Miss Trimingham early . Miss Trimingham ? Yes . Come on , Josephine . Help me with these bags . You 'll find your old room , just exactly the way you left it . Nellie , who 's Miss Trimingham ? - She 's your mother 's trained nurse . - Trained nurse ? For the drinking , Mr . Alfred . Alfred . Oh , my Alfred ! Mother , you all right ? Oh , forgive me . How horrible . I 'm so excited and awkward . - Oh , but you 're home . - Yes , Mother . Oh , darling , do n't . Do n't look at
zone1	like this . I 'm so tired , and I 'm not feeling well . Could n't we save everything for tomorrow , when I 'll be at my best ? We 'll make believe there was no tonight and that you came home tomorrow and we 'll say all our hellos as they should be . - Sure , Mother . Here comes your father . Now make allowances . He 's not at his best . Here we are , Sam , and look who 's with me . - My boy . Home at last . - Hello , Father . Hello , Father ? Is that all after all this time ? - No . There 's a lot more . - Yes , I should think there would be . - Now what 've you done to yourself ? - She just tripped and fell . - Does n't he look wonderful ? - Yes . Let 's get in the house . Now , Sam , what we 've decided is we 're not going to say our hellos tonight . We 're all
zone1	as a daisy . How was the war ? OK , I guess . We won it . Oh , have you met my son ? Alfred , this is Miss Trimingham . - How do you do ? - Welcome home . Up we go . Cool sheets and heavenly rest . Good night , Alfred . Sleep as late as you like and remember , you 're coming home tomorrow . Tonight never even happened . The house looks good . Yeah . Your mother touched it up a bit here and there . - You 've put on a couple ofpounds . - Soft living in the navy . I suppose you 're sleepy . I was up at quarter to 6:oo this morning . - Not a very good time to talk now anyway , is it ? No , I guess it is n't . I guess I 'll go upstairs , too . If it 's all right with you . - Father ? - Yeah ? Nothing . Good night . Good night . She does n't need you now . Well ,
zone1	home again and seeing your mother and father ? Things do n't change , Nellie . They just get more so . We got ginger ale , seltzer , and no liquor . Where 's the liquor ? Your father keeps it under lock and key . - Good night , Mr . Alfred . - Good night . Even the servants in your own house , know about you . I 'm tired . I 'm sick . Leave me alone . I 'll leave you alone when you tell me everything I want to know . - Who else saw you together ? - Nobody else . Not a soul . - You were in restaurants together . - Never . Wallowing in filth together ! - And I want to know where every damn place ! - No . - Well , you 're going to tell me . - Oh no , Sam , not tonight . Please . - Where else did you meet him ? - Nowhere else . Only his house . You 're lying to me . You were with him in
zone1	. You could stay with him and me the same night ? Yes ! Did you think you 're any better , than one of those sluts on River Street ? I 'm not proud of myself . Not proud of herself , she says . - How can you look at your own son ? - I ca n't . If that egotistical little father of yours was alive to know about this ... Yourson . Your father . Your heroes . I have no heroes , only some people I love . - You were my hero . - Shut up ! And you drove me to it . You turned your back on me just like you did on Alfred . I needed love wherever I could find it . Love ! You 're a pig . I ca n't stand the sight of you . Mr Eaton . His name is Charles Frolick . - He 's a terrible , evil man . - How long has it been going on ? About a year . She 's been trying not to see him , but
zone1	herself . Frolick ? Number 22 Walnut Street , Philadelphia . - Yes , what is it ? - Are you Charles Frolick ? I am . What kind of an hour of the night ... - Who the devil are you ? - Charlie . What do you think you 're doing here ? Charlie ! My name is Alfred Eaton . Alfred Eaton . You got that ? Now , you go near my mother again , I 'll kill you . Charlie ? What 's the big idea ofkeeping me ... Charlie ! - Mr . Alfred down yet ? - He 's having breakfast , sir . There you are , boy . - Watch those eggs , Nellie . - Yes , Mr Eaton . Well , how did it feel sleeping in your own bed ? You mother wanted to buy a new mattress , but I said no . I slept very well . Thank you . Well , I did n't . It 's not as easy as it used to be . Still , I guess I 'm all right for
zone1	my tail off during the war . I might even get a chance to rest . We all are , in our business . Big contracts canceled months ago and now those darn fool workers are going to strike . Let them . There 'll be nothing , but gas in their kids ' bellies by the time they come back . Pay them exactly what you want . What do you care ? I care because I 'm against anybody going on strike against me . You 'll know what I feel , when you come into the business with me . - Well , I suppose you 're thinking of taking it easy . - Not exactly . Maybe traveling a bit , seeing something of the country before settling down here . We got to start thinking of a club in Philadelphia for you . I doubt I 'll be joining a club , but if I do , it 'll probably be in New York . New York ? What for ? I expect to be spending some time there . I thought you were going
zone1	. I did n't . My home base will be in New York . - The hell it will . - The hell it wo n't ! I guess I do n't feel like having any breakfast . Tell them in the kitchen I 'm not staying . Do n't you want to hear what my plans are ? I 'm in no hurry to . I can see you wo n't do what I 'd hoped and you have n't discussed it with me . I 'd be glad to discuss it . You want to tell me to go to the devil and take the mill with me . You 've been wanting to do that all your life . All I wanted to do is to be friends with you . That 's what you want , friendship ? I have n't got a friend for every 10 years I 've lived . I hoped for that , too . First , you 'll have to show me you 're a man I 'd want to be friends with . The job at the mill was yours
zone1	. Would come out of what , being your errand boy ? You never asked me what I wanted to do . Now I 'm supposed to go into the mill to please you . You 'd cripple me for life . You do n't think I can make it on my own . You 're not big enough to even walk in my shadow and you never will be . Alfred . So much shouting so early in the day with the servants around , too . I guess we 're not a very respectable family , are we ? - You must give him time . - For what ? He 'll never change . He might get used to your ways . I do n't think I have that much time . Neither has he . There 's a lot of sadness and sweetness in you , Alfred , but you can be very cruel and cold sometimes . Oh nice , kind Alfred . Did I just say something awful ? - I 'm sorry . - Nothing for you to be sorry about . Yes
zone1	I used to be nice and I do n't even remember what made me change . Do n't be hard on yourself . I know a lot more than you think I do . You 're still my mother . What do you know ? Everything . Oh , God . Put your arms around me , Alfred . - Do you still like me a little ? - I love you , Mother . Even when I 'm like this ? - You 're leaving us , are n't you , Alfred ? - Yes . Where are you going ? I may stay with Lex Porter in New York for a while . I suppose you 'll see the Thorntons . Fritz Thornton is throwing a party for Lex tonight in Southampton . The Porters and the Thorntons are like a second family to you , but just remember , they 're not . Do n't get too independent . Do n't cut off your own flesh and blood . Anybody can disappoint you , if you catch them at the wrong time and that includes you ,
zone1	you think your mother ought to be . I 'm sorry if it embarrasses you and I 'm not going to make any excuses . Do n't worry . That 's not why I 'm leaving . I could feel it last night your very first look at me down in the driveway . What am I ? Ahopeless drunkard ? They 'd rather have me that than the other thing an unfaithful wife . Apig , he called me . Well , the drinking makes a good cover-up for a lot of things . Goodbye now , Mother . " It would n't have happened if she had n't been a drinker . " " Martha Eaton would n't do such things , if she did n't like gin and whiskey so much . " Well , little do they know . Little does anybody know . - May I have this dance ? - Oh , why , certainly . - Will you pardon me just a moment ? - Sure . Thank you . Are you looking for me ? - I am if yourname is Lex
zone1	'll change it if you 'll stop looking further . Just how far am I allowed to look ? You 're fresh . - I like you . Sam ? - No , Alfred . Are you going to make a pass at me ? You believe in long courtships , do n't you ? - Who 's got time ? I 'm crowding 19 . - What , years or guys ? Nasty . Come on . Let 's dance and crowd each other . I better go fill my wooden leg . You mean it 's all over between us ? Well , these things do n't last forever . Waiter , tell me where I can find Mr Porter . He went into the den a few minutes ago , sir . - Excuse me . - Hey , wait a minute . - Alfred , when did you get here ? - Couple of minutes ago . Come in . Join us . Alfred Eaton , Sage Rimmington . - Sorry . - So am I . Sage , this is the rover boy , I
zone1	what lies ahead ? Darling , if you 'll excuse me ... I think I 'll put on something more comfortable . Like my husband . Bye , sweetie . - I like that . - Oh , she 's very inventive . - How was it , boy ? - How was what ? - Getting home . - Great . Yeah , me , too . I snapped out of it , though . Good booze , bad women . It never fails to work . How did things go in the money department ? Our project . Did you raise the dough ? Oh , your old man . Well , I 'll have another little talk with Uncle Fritz . I 'll just charm him into putting up the whole 500,000 . I do n't want that . I know you do n't , sport , but have we got any choice ? I do n't mean to sound ungrateful , but let 's wait till I can swing my own end . I 'm not going into any business venture , where I carry as
zone1	It does n't mean that much to me . It does to me . Boy , you did have a rough time at home , did n't you ? We got to get you out of there . - I 've already taken care of that . - Really ? - What are your plans ? - I do n't know . I was sort of , thinking about that bachelor apartment you were going to set up in Gramercy Park . Hey , now you 're talking . Play it by ear for a while . Well , you can use your ear . I got better ideas . Let 's start right now . Now , would you look at this ? 200 beautiful Long Island virgins . Markel 's dance music , buckets of champagne ... and I 'm the guest of honor . Now , how can I lose ? Unless I start getting drunk and taking those little girls upstairs . - I met something called Clemmie . - Oh , ClemmieShreve . Now , I 'm saving that for a rainy night . There
zone1	- I 'm so glad to see you . - Mr Thornton , how are you ? This party would n't be complete without you . Champagne for three . - Have they been treating you properly here ? - No complaints . I hope you 'll stay with us for a good long visit . - I may take you up on that . - I hoped for this moment . The three of us together like this as I hoped for victory . God bless you . - Thought I might as well start at the top . - Did you ? Pretty close to it . Thanks for the compliment . Who are you ? Alfred Eaton . That would n't mean anything to you . What 's your name ? - Mary St . John . - That 's a nice , respectable name . Well , of course it 's respectable . That 's a silly thing to say . Am I the first to call it respectable ? You 're the first who ever raised the question . Then I 'm glad I called
zone1	trying to annoy me , you 're succeeding . My manners are rusty . You 're the first girl I 've danced with for a long time . Why did n't you bestow that honor on someone inside instead of here on the terrace ? I rather like the view from the terrace . Then I saw you and I liked the view even more . You touch me deeply . But not in the right places . Well , that was reasonably disagreeable . Yes , and it was so easy . Would you like to go cry or something ? No , but I would n't mind , if you faded away into the sunset . Here comes the bird dog , to retrieve you . What 's his name ? - Jim Roper . , - Oh , grim Jim Roper ? No . Dr Roper . He 's a psychiatrist . Oh , sorry . I hope you get well very soon . Good night , Mr Eaton . Good night , Miss St . John . All yours , Doctor . I know that .
zone1	I heard they were like minks during the war . - How are you doing ? - You tell me . Who 's Mary St . John ? Her old man 's with the DuPont Corporation down in Wilmington . - Fancy pedigree . - Papers on both sides . - Hey , waiter . You can forget about her . - Why ? - You want one ? - No . She 's secretly engaged to the guy she 's with , the doctor , Jim Roper . I do n't think he 's rich enough for her , but if it is n't him it 'll be somebody else who is . If you 're not thinking about marrying her , you can forget about anything else . She 's really saving it . - Want to make a little bet ? - Oh , wake up , sport . You have n't got the necessary qualifications . Well , there are all kinds of qualifications . And straight ahead you 'll notice the famous Whitney estate . Oh , and there to the right is the estate
zone1	from the chimney ? In all probability Mr MacHardie is burning money . Stop hiding behind the glasses . I 'm not hiding . You always manage to put something between us like Jim Roper , or your friend Sage Rimmington , or the net of a tennis court . What are you afraid of ? - Let 's row back to shore shall we ? - See what I mean ? I do n't know why you bother talking to me . Every time you do , you get sarcastic and we end up fighting . Now , if you do n't approve of me , just leave me alone . I 'm sure I wo n't perish from unhappiness . This is the first time we 've been alone . - How long are you going to be here ? - A month or so . Then back to Wilmington ? I used to live very close to there Port Johnson , Pennsylvania . I thought you lived in New York , in Gramercy Park , with Lex and all the stray girls you could lay your hands
zone1	'd better go back . - You do n't mean that . - Yes , I do mean that . I knew you would kiss me today , but I did n't know I 'd kiss you back . It wo n't happen again so do n't try to get me alone somewhere . - You 'd like that . - Stop it . - Why ? - ' Cause I 'm engaged to Jim Roper . - You going to marry him ? - Well , I 'm engaged to him . But you did n't say you were going to marry him . Are you going to row me back to shore or am I going to have to swim back ? Swim . Hello , Alfred . - Who is it , Mary ? - It 's just a friend , Mother . Well , who is it , Mary ? I think you better come in . Mother , this is Alfred Eaton . My mother . - How do you do ? - Mr Eaton . And my father . Daddy , Alfred Eaton .
zone1	believe we 've seen you before . - Are you from these parts ? - Port Johnson , Pennsylvania . Oh , yes . The steel mill . So , you 're that Eaton . What do you think of the strike ? I 'm not in the mill , but my father does n't like it . I should n't think he would . Well , what brings you to Wilmington at this awkward hour ? I was just duck hunting on my way to New York . Thought I 'd say hello to Mary . - How was the shooting ? - Got a few tail feathers . How is Jim ? - Jim ? - Yes . - You mean Jim Roper ? - Yes . I assume you 're close friends . Not exactly . Oh , well , now , not a friend ofJim's . - Is n't that a bit strange ? - No , Mother . Jim and I met Alfred at the same time . - Then he 's really a friend of yours , more than Jim's . - That 's
zone1	the mill . What do you do ? I mean , besides duck hunting in the middle of the week . Actually , I 've got some exciting business plans . - I 'm not allowed to disclose them now . - I see . Well , I guess I better be going . My husband will see you to the door . - No , I will . - Good night , sir . - Good night . - Good night , Mrs St . John . - Goodbye , Mr Eaton . Your mother and father are sort of distant . Now , what do you mean by that ? You know what I mean . You never did believe I was going to marry Jim , did you ? I wrote him a letter and I broke up with him . Why did n't you tell me ? I do n't know . I did n't tell anybody . Alfred ? Are you going to do something and be somebody ? - For you ? - Yes . - Settle down ? - Yes . With you
zone1	you . More than anything in the whole world . Mary ? You 're never going to want anybody else as long as you live . You better go in now . I should think he 'd know better . - He wanted to see me . - And you should , too . I happen to like Alfred , Mother . The Eatons are nothing and nobody . The motheris a drunkard . The father is a nouveau riche war profiteer . How do you know ? You have n't met them . I have sources of information . If he were a gentleman , he 'd stay away before people start talking . We do n't want him . That 's all there is to it . That is n't all there is to it . - I 've broken my engagement to Jim . - I ca n't believe it . Mary ... I forbid you to see this man again . I do n't like that word forbid . It makes me want to disobey you . In that case , I shall have a talk
zone1	meant the young man , but you 've given me an idea . Do n't do that , father ! It 's my life ! I do n't have to take that kind of talk from Eugene St . John or any of that DuPont crowd ! - You did n't . You hung up on him . - If you 'd stayed where you belong ... - Maybe I do n't like where I belong . - That 's what sours your insides that my blood and your mother 's is running through your veins . That 's why you get mixed up with a family who does n't want you . - I 'm not interested in her family ! - You ca n't buy respectability by slipping a wedding ring on it . Sometimes you end up with what you 're running from . - And remember , I told you . - If you 're through , I 'm going . Where , back to that apartment your friend Porter and all those questionable goings-on ? You have n't done an honest day 's work since
zone1	going into business with Lex Porter . Business ? What kind of business ? - Aircraft , private planes . - Airplanes . That 's right . We 're going to design , them , build them and sell them . What are you going to use for money ? It 's already been taken care of . - Lex 's family financing you ? V - That 's right . - 100%/ ? ? - Yes , 10o% . You 're puttingVyour head in a noose . I was going to ask you for my share , but I changed my mind . How much were you going to ask me to give you ? Not give , lend . What 's the difference ? Here 's what I think of your airplane business . Put me down for 500 dollars . Well , that 's exactly 500 dollars more than I expected if I had asked you for it . - Wait a minute . - It 's too late . It 's something else . There 's something I have to know . I 've been wanting
zone1	do n't know how to start this . I mean , where 's the beginning ? Did you ever hear of a man named Frolick ? - Did you ? - Yes . In what connection ? I 'd rather you put the question some other way . All right . - Did you ever meet this man ? - I saw him once . - Did you beat him up ? - Yes , I did . Thank God . Thank God it was you . Maybe you 're a lot of things I never gave you credit for , but a man my age ca n't change so quickly . I can admit I 've been wrong all these years , but that would n't make anything right . It wo n't take away what I felt about you , what I still feel , regardless of what I know in my brain . Some time when you have children , you 'll know . One of them is in here . He shines . His voice is music . You love him as though he never lived
zone1	Billy was to me long before he died . And when he died , there was nobody who understood what happened to me . You were living , you were alive , a deliberate thing God did to me . I did n't want another son or anyone in my life . Not you , not even your mother . Just Billy . That 's why your mother took Frolick , not because she 's immoral , because I did n't even tell her I did n't love her anymore . She had to find that out for herself . I guess she knew it before I did . And yet , even knowing , how badly it turned out for everybody , including myself , I would do the same thing over again . It was so wonderful loving Billy that much . Always in your thoughts . I can feel his arms around my neck this minute . Do n't go . Do n't go ? What do you think I am ? Alfred , I did n't mean it ! Alfred , my son ... Alfred ?
zone1	evening . Good evening . How 's your father ? It 's hard to tell . He 's always the same man sick or well . Yes . Old men may seem unchangeable to you , Alfred , but life itself now , there 's a different thing . Consider this . Aweek ago , I was opposed to any thought of you two marrying . Tonight , I 'm not only reconciled to it I 'm secretly in favor of it . Yes . Life 's full of unpredictable ironies . Now , you would n't have thought it was going to be your own father who would be responsible for this change in my attitude . My father ? How ? By having this unfortunate heart attack which automatically transforms your life . You suddenly change from irresponsible young man to the active head of a family and Eaton Iron and Steel . And this removes the objections we had to you as a prospective son-in-law . You have n't had experience running a mill , Alfred , but you can be sure I 'll help you in
zone1	but I have n't got the slightest intention of running my father 's mill . I plan to be active head of my own family , which means Mary and me . Good night , sir . Good night , Mary . Do you give up ? Yes , I give up . - Congratulations . - Thank you . Eugene , lovely day for a wedding . Hello , Mary . I would n't miss this for the world . - Do n't go , Sage . - I think I 'd better . I read all your letters . I know exactly how you feel . Does he know you the way I do ? Does he know that wild and wonderful nature of yours ? I think you 'd better leave . - It wo n't work . - Please go . You do n't have to marry him to get what you want of him . Good luck , Mary . Yeah ? Hi . What 's the matter you change your mind ? Alfred , do you love me ? Do I love you ?
zone1	called ? All right . I love you . I love you . I love yoi . And incidentally we have a date tonight . Careful , now . Somebody might be listening . Yeah . Bye-bye . Hi . Come on in . I 've got a great idea . Porter-Eaton Flying Machine Company . Tailspins , Incorporated . Bottoms Up Corporation ? If Uncle Fritz ever heard me talking like this he 'd probably take back the money . Alfred , you trust me , do n't you ? Why , sure , I do . You 're my best man . I have to tell you something , then . I ca n't . Your mother just phoned from the hospital . She told me not to say anything especially to you . What is it ? Your father died a few minutes ago . I 'm sorry . - Shall I tell them to call off the wedding ? - No . Well , I guess he hated me so much , he could n't even ... Stand to be alive on the day I got
zone1	She 's like my ideal woman : handles easily , levels off without too much work . - Hey , buddy , you 're not with me . - Oh , I 'm with you . Come on , what is it ? I saw those new engines in the hangar today . The navy ordered 100 from Continental . - We heard about it and got two . - Who 's we ? - Von Elm and myself . - Why was n't I consulted ? - We need engines , do n't we ? - Yeah . I do n't like your going over my head . How do you like it ? We 're about to buzz your happy little home and your happy little wife . The least you can do is put a smile , on that sour pan of yours . What did you marry , a man or a mosquito ? Very much a man , Sage . A delicious man and all man from the top of his head to the tip of his toes . What was that " ah-ah "
zone1	If you 're about to say , " Why no children ? " don't . - That 's my doing , not his . - Me talk about children ? I hate the little stinkers . You absolutely shock me , Sage . Why , because I say what you secretly feel ? Oh , stop it . It 's unfair , you know , the way I tell you everything about Steve and me , what it 's like when we 're alone together ... And you not only do n't let me in on a thing ... that goes on between you and that gorgeous fellow , you even try to pull the wool over my eyes . The trouble with you is you 're nothing but a frustrated Peeping Tom . Wrong gender , darling . Come on now , woman-to-woman , what 's he like ? He 's fine . If only he 'd come home into your waiting arms a little more often , huh ? Precisely what can a group ofred-blooded American males , do to an airplane propeller until 4:oo in the morning
zone1	a man who was n't interested in being successful . Oh , I 'm curious . What does success look like when you turn out the lights ? Oh , you 're impossible , Sage . I say if work is a man 's mistress then there 's only one answer for the wife ... Another man . And how is Jim Roper these days ? - Ever hear from him ? - Of course not . Now , do n't let faint heart spoil life 's golden opportunities , darling . I do n't want to seem a bore , but I 'm not interested in this . - What gives ? - I do n't know . - Pull it up . - I 'm trying . What happened ? Fortunately , he woke up in time . Looked like the new stabilizer to me . What new stabilizer ? We 're trying out a modified version of the old one . What 's wrong with the unmodified version of the old one ? Well , nothing , really , but there 's always room for refinement .
zone1	out of the fact that nobody told me what 's happening . I got a bigger point to make . You and Von Elm must think we 're running an aeronautical laboratory . We 're designing planes , refining planes , modifying planes , redesigning planes . We 're doing everything but selling planes . Either we 're in business or not . I think we got a good plane there . Let 's freeze the design , start manufacturing , and start selling . And if you do n't see it that way , we ought to sit down and have a serious talk . In your office or mine ? Every time Sage start stalking like that , I get a little crazy . I do n't want to win out anymore . I just want to get out . I feel like I 'm blushing all over . I 'd hate to have her think I 'm a ... What do you call me ? Ahot number . Lex does n't give a hang about business . I went into this to make money , not in
zone1	could think of was one thing . How much I wanted you . If he and Von Elm want to play Tiddlywinks , with Fritz Thornton 's money they can do it without me . Sunday , I 'll tell them either I get some control , or I want out . Darling ? You talk too much . - So long , Mary , Jim . - See you back at the house . - Can we go inside , Mr Thornton ? - You cold ? I 'd like to have a few words with you . Sure you do n't want to keep an eye on Mary ? - Why ? She 's a good skater . - That 's not exactly what I meant . - You were my girl . - Obviously I was n't your girl . You would n't say awful things , about somebody you cared about . You made a fool out of me . Think I 'd be a little gentleman ? If you wanted to make me feel terrible , you 've succeeded . Jim , do n't .
zone1	's you . That 's a filthy thing to say . I 've had a dozen girls since you left me , but they 've all been you , Mary . That 's the way it 's going to be with you . Some night in bed , he 'll turn into me . You angry , Alfred , or just thinking ? What ? Oh , no , I 'm not angry . I expected you to support Lex and Von Elm . I admit it would be easier to make money now , but it would be nothing compared to what might come in 5 or 10 years if the itch for quick profits could , remain unscratched for a while . Well , I have to make a decision then do n't I , MrThornton ? Yes , I guess you do , but not today . On the seventh day the businessman should rest . If it was nothing why were you running away from him ? I was not running away . My fingers were freezing . Do you want a wife with frozen fingers
zone1	He still loves me . Thanks . You would n't have believed me if I said we talked about the weather . Did he kiss you ? - I bet he tried to kiss you . - Not only that . He picked me up in his arms and carried me off . You 're just trying to make a joke out of it . Darling , you 're being silly . I like him . I always have liked him . You ca n't expect me to stop liking my men friends any more than I can expect you to stop liking your women friends . - Let 's not talk about it . - That suits me fine . Sandy ! Sandy ! Alfred , stop the car . Look ! Sandy fell in ! Oh , sir ! Mr MacHardie ! Sandy fell in . He would n't listen to me . Here , give him to me . - Get away from here . Who are you ? - I 'm his grandfather . Call a doctor , the fire department . It 's all right
zone1	you . I wish he 'd let it go at sending flowers . You rescued the grandson of James Duncan MacHardie , who is only the most famous financier in America . I know . We 'll get a lot more than a houseful of flowers and an evening of gratitude , you can be sure . First he 'll look us over to find out whether we 're sufficiently respectable . - That word again . - Then he 'll look me over to find out whether my halo 's bright enough to qualify me for one of those desks of his at number25 Wall Street . An aging fortress of banking integrity . You must admit the timing 's perfect what with you planning to leave Lex and no job in sight . How do you know I 'll take his job ? Because I know you , darling , and you 're very shrewd . You 're not at all the kind of man to turn down the opportunity of a lifetime . No matter how much you protest , darling . Besides , does n't Wall
zone1	love the idea of your being available to me more often . - Is that all it would mean to you ? - What 's wrong with a girl worrying about her own needs now and then ? How nice of you to come . I 'm Jean Duffy , Mr MacHardie 's daughter , and Sandy 's very grateful mother . This is my husband Creighton . - We wanted to thank you alone ... - And we do . But we also wanted Sandy to meet the gentleman who saved his life . Oh Sandy , dear . - This is Mrs Eaton . - Hello , Sandy . - And Mr Eaton you have met before . - Glad you dried off . - Thank you very much for fishing me out of the pond . My pleasure . - And ? , - And ... Oh , yes . And it 's a good thing I was n't any smaller or you 'd have had to throw me back . - Oh , very good . - Good . Now , son , skedaddle . -
zone1	your cocktail . Creighton , will you and Mrs Eaton lead the way ? You were very sweet to him , Mr Eaton . I 'd like you to meet the other guests . Mrs Ripley ... Lady Sevringham ... Mrs Pearson ... Lord Sevringham . - My father you know , of course . - Glad to see you again , sir . And MrThornton . MrAnd Mrs Eaton . I think that does it . I did n't expect to see you here . It might turn out to be something of an occasion . Watch out for Creighton Duffy . He 's a member of Machardie and Company , but only because he 's a son-in-law . Resents competition . You have a Portland , Oregon and a Portland , Maine . Why , when you have a new country like this and a splendid opportunity to start from scratch with all-new names why must you have two Portlands ? Well , we have a lot worse than that . - You 've heard of California . - I have a friend there . - And you
zone1	so . - And Pennsylvania . - Philadelphia is in Pennsylvania . But we have a California in Pennsylvania , and an Indiana in Pennsylvania . - I 'm not at all surprised . You have a place in New York called the Polo Grounds and all they do there is play baseball and football . I never saw an elephant in Piccadilly Circus . Did you ? Well , gentlemen , I think brandy and cigars are in order . Creighton , will you play host in the lounge while I have a few words with Mr Eaton ? I like the way you handle yourself , young man . It was a lucky shot . I was not referring to your manipulation of a cue stick . I 've made inquiries about you , Mr Eaton and the results have been most satisfying . I 'm very flattered . I 'm not in the habit of offering positions with MacHardie and Company to men who qualify as lifeguards and nothing more . That seems to make good sense , just as a sensible man ought never to accept
zone1	sure that that 's what he wants . Can a man be that sure of his goals ? - I think so . - Tell me yours . I want to live in a big world compete with big people , and make big money . - How big is big ? - As big as you are , sir . Certainly bigger than my father . I always wanted to top my father , too . It helped me to achieve what I did even if I fell short by almost 30 million . I do n't intend to fall short . And preferably not with your present business associates ? There is such a thing as information , Mr Eaton . And you 've got it . - How long will it take you to settle your affairs ? - Two months . - Shall we join the ladies ? - At your pleasure . Yeah . What ? You 're right , Mary . I 'm sorry . I said I 'm sorry . Well , why do n't you go on ahead , then and I
zone1	. Right now . Absolutely . - When will he get back ? - In time for Christmas , he hopes . What 's he doing in California ? He 's not in California . That was last year . It 's Colorado . What 's he doing in Colorado ? Buying a copper mine for Mr MacHardie . Well , make sure he buys you one , too . How is every little thing in Baton Rouge , Louisiana ? It is Louisiana , is n't it ? Alfred , you 'll have to speak up . I ca n't hear you . Look , why do n't you come a little closer like ... New York City ? That 's in New York state , remember ? I am not . I 've only had one teeny little glass of champagne . Oh , just the usual crowd . You know , Sage and Steve , Nancy and Parker Wells and ... Nobody else you know , I do n't think . Yes , dear , I will . You , too . Bye-bye . Tell him we
zone1	... - Yes ? Mr MacHardie wishes to have lunch with you at 12:oo . I 've got another engagement . - It is now 3 minutes to 12:oo , sir . - All right . Thank you , sir . See if you can catch Mrs Eaton at home ... and if it 's too late , just call the restaurant . - Yes . You will be there posing as one of our bond salesmen opening up new territory eyes open , ear to the ground . Find out all you can about a man named Ralph WBenziger . - Benziger . - If we ever make sizable commitments in that area , this is the man we might want to take charge provided his hands are clean . That 's for you to find out , what kind of man he is . A question , sir . Was it Mr Duffy that suggested me for this expedition to Mountain City ? In the past , you might have felt that Mr Duffy recommended you for other surveys in order to keep you away from home base
zone1	It 's of no interest to me . I am interested only in results . I may tell you , young man , they have been enormously profitable and largely due to the shrewdness of your reports . Thank you , sir . Not to go beyond the walls of this room ... The only gold stars on my son-in-law 's record have been his recommendation of you for these assignments . - How long will I be gone ? - You 'll be there about two months . - Can I take my wife ? - I prefer not . - Plan to leave not later than Friday night . - Friday night ? We just moved into our New York apartment . We 've got 35 people coming over on Sunday . I 've never made any sacrifice for this firm that I did n't feel amply repaid . No dessert for me . Good luck and good day to you . - Well , good night , Mary . - Thank you , Steve . Good morning . Good morning . Why did n't you meet us
zone1	I got home too late . I had to finish that Dunham Report . I suppose I 'm supposed to know what the Dunham Report is . One of the trivial little things that helps pay to keep you neck and neck with Harper 's Bazaar . - Thank you . Incidentally , just where did you wear that little number until 2:oo this morning ? I wore this little number to the Mona Lisa . Would you unzip me in the back , please ? I thought Sage did n't like that place anymore . Oh , Sage was n't along . She stayed home with a bad tooth or something . - What , just you and her husband ? - Just little old us . Ca n't you do any better than that ? As a matter of fact , I could have , but he had another date with the Dingham Report . - Dunham . Oh , so sorry . Dunham . Suppose you tell me what was so important that you left me sitting alone today ... over a chicken salad sandwich while you
zone1	new assignment . The coal regions ofPennsylvania . I 'd give you the details , but you 're obviously not interested . I have to leave Friday night . - And what about the party on Sunday ? - I know . I 'm sorry . And just how long do you suppose you 'll be gone this time ? About two months . And of course I am forbidden to go with you or to visit you because ... It 's not exactly forbidden , but ... The trouble with this company is it 's run by old men . I hope you know what they 're doing to us . What should I do , resign ? I 'm not going to sit around and stare at four walls again . - You do n't have to . - If somebody invites me to the theater , I 'm going to the theater . - Go to the theater ! What if it 's somebody you do n't know ? Aman . I do n't want you having dates with guys I do n't know . Suppose it
zone1	For instance ? - Jim Roper . - What made you think of him ? - He 's coming to the party on Sunday . How did that happen ? I ran into him on Fifth Avenue and invited him . In that case , I 'm glad I 'm not going to be here . It 's probably just as well if that 's your attitude . Yeah , it is my attitude . Another thing : you 're not going out with Jim Roper and that 's final ! - Final ? - Yes ! That 's final . Well , I would n't be too sure . You go right along to Pennsylvania and you play with your grimy coal miners , but do n't be too sure . Anything on that call to New York ? - Come in . - Here you are , sir . Keep trying , will you ? - They 're celebrating the football game . - No kidding . They play on Sunday ? Sure . Mountain City beat the Steamrollers 28 to nothing . Thanks . Hey , you
zone1	- Nope . Sorry . - You played awful dirty . You should have been thrown out of the game . - I was . - No , you were n't , but you should have been . - You 're cute . - Come on in and join us . I 've got a couple of quarts . - I 'm in training . - For what ? - I 'll bet you 're married . - You 're absolutely right . - My wife gave a party today . - She did ? - You know who was there ? - Who ? - Not me . Why do n't we stay in here , then ? I bet you wo n't be sorry ' cause when I like a fella ... - I hate to say no to a lady . - Well , don't . - But you got to beat it . - What do you mean ? I just got here . - And you just went out . - Well , luck to you , Buckley ! - Hello . Hello , Mary
zone1	. Well , nobody was here . We all went to dinner at Michel 's after the party . Who 's " we " ? Peg and Bill , Sage and Steve and Jim Roper and I . - Who brought you home ? - Jim . - How long did he stay ? - About half an hour . You going to see him again ? I do n't know ... Oh , yes . He 'll be at Peg and Bill 's Friday for dinner . Then he 'll undoubtedly bring you home . Possibly . I do n't know . You know what you 're doing , do n't you ? Yes . I 'm showing you I wo n't stay cooped up while you 're free as a bird all in the holy name of career . Listen , I do n't want that guy in our apartment anymore . You tell him , or I 'll come back and tell him myself . If I do , he 'll have a tough time explaining a busted head to his patients . Very well . I
zone1	that 's all . You 're not to come up here anymore . People do n't think of this area as being cold . We have readings of 15 , 18 , 20 degrees below . I 'm glad you came in to see me today , Mr Eaton . I 'm not always as talkative as this . Maybe that 's because I do n't run across many ... who are willing to listen . It 's my pleasure , Mr Benziger . I mean it . That 's mighty nice of you . Makes me feel poorly about not being in the market for any bonds right now . I know how it is breaking in a new territory . We 've got good days and bad days . This happens to be one of my good one's . Local folks tell me you 've been making a few inquiries about me . Yes , sir . Alittle . If you heard anything disgraceful , it 's probably true . You down here all by yourself ? - Pretty lonesome town . - My wife 's back in
zone1	eh ? - No . No kiddies . Excuse me . Yes ? Well , put her on . Hello , Natalie . Oh , let 's see . In about ... 15 minutes . Yeah , I will . Oh , hold on a second . You 're alone . Why do n't you join us for dinner ? You wo n't get as good a steak anywhere , I guarantee you . - If that 's an invitation , I 'm sold . - Good . Nat ? Tell Mother I 'm bringing a guest for dinner . I will . Bye . Quiet , Rocco , it 's all right , yes . He can be pretty loud at times . My wife and daughter are alone a good deal at night . - Hello , Dad . - Hi , Nat . Natalie , this is Mr Eaton . How do you do ? Wo n't you come in ? Oh , Dad . Like the side of a matchbox . Ca n't think why . I shaved at 5:oothis morning . I 'll take those
zone1	but we 're getting new shelves . - You hear that , Dad ? - I heard . I know . I have n't finished them yet . This is the den , but as you see , it 's as much office as den . - I 'll go get Mother . Be down in a minute . - Okay . I 'd never seen a mine before last Monday . - This one of yours ? - Yes . That 's number four . Dad wanted to call it the Natalie , but he was overruled . This one 's number one . It 's the oldest , but number four is our pride and joy . When built , it was the most electrified colliery in the world . This is my favorite room in the whole house . I used to come here and do my homework . - Especially your arithmetic . - Why do you say that ? So your father could help you . No . I was very good in arithmetic , but he did help me with everything else . He
zone1	- I 'm in no hurry for one . - Tell me something . - Yes ? How does it feel to be someone like you , blooming in a coal town like this ? Do you really want to know ? Well , I love it here . When the mountains are covered with laurel or snow , there 's something so beautiful about them . And the people , too . The miners . The old one's , not the young . I 've been in so many of their homes . Not much time left to them . Not much to show for working hard all their lives , yet they have such dignity and wisdom , sorrow and pride . Oh , Mother , this is Mr Eaton . Good evening . It 's nice of you to come . You 're kind to have me . Why is everyone standing around ? Let 's have a drink . - Nothing for me , dear . - Nor me , Dad . What 's wrong with you people ? Mr Eaton ? - Straight scotch is
zone1	drink now . We do n't want ours teak ruined . Welcome to our city . Welcome to our home . And all that 's beautiful in it . I guess we live closer to basic instincts here than some other regions I could name . These miners are a pretty hard-bitten lot . Sometimes they start home a little drunk , fall down an air shaft , get bitten by a rattlesnake , drown in a dam . Yet I have to say I ca n't blame the men ... Goodness , I had no idea . Well , I can finish this tomorrow . - Coming to bed ? - Maybe I 'm a softie baby the men too much , but ... - Good night , Mr Eaton . - Good night . Thank you very much . We enjoyed having you . I might as well say good night , too . Nat , would you keep Mr Eaton company for a minute ? Mother has a heart condition . She never stays up later than 1o : oo . What do you do with your
zone1	? No , I have no particular heart condition of either kind . I do wel fare work , gardening , go to the movies ... The usual . - Would you go to the movies with me sometime ? - No . ' Cause I 'm married ? That 's a pretty good reason at least in Mountain City . How about going to the movies with me in Philadelphia ? Mr Eaton , you probably have a very nice wife . I suppose you 're angry because I asked you . - No . I consider it a compliment . - I hope you do . You 're the first person I 've asked out since I 've been married . - Thank you . - There 's some other things ... I really do n't want to encourage this conversation . - Mother all right , Dad ? - Oh , yes . I had some things to tell her . I wo n't be seeing her in the morning . I guess I 'll be wandering along . Natalie 's having some people for dinner Saturday
zone1	. I do n't think Mr Eaton would enjoy himself . It 's just our bridge club . - I 'll take a rain check . Another time . - That would be better . All right , but we hope you 'll come , back for dinner sometime . - Good night . - Good night . - Good night . - Good night . Hello . Hello . Natalie ? I was just thinking about you . What were you thinking ? I 'm glad you did the right thing . You said no and turned me out into the cold and lonely night . Do n't . You saved me from making a big mistake . Maybe it was I who made the mistake . What do you mean ? I do n't know . I 'm not sure . Are you ? No . There 's a drive-in movie just outside of town . - The last show starts at 9:30 . - Yes ? - Tomorrow night ? - Tomorrow night . The last row of cars . A yellow Plymouth convertible , slightly covered
zone1	mistake . You know that , do n't you ? Yes . I know . Good night . Good night . - Hello . - Hello . I guess we 're the only two people watching the movie . - You know something ? - What ? I do n't even know your first name . Actually , it 's David . David Alfred Eaton . See , I liked David , and my father liked Alfred , so it was Alfred . - May I call you David ? If you like . - Do you believe in love at first sight ? - No . - Neither do I . - I believe in confusion . Yes . Aman walks around in a desert all his life looking for water . All he ever finds is sand . I did n't know you were lost in the desert . I did n't know it either until last night . I walked into a house where there was warmth that did n't come from radiators . I saw your mother and father , and I saw you . You
zone1	's all . No . In one evening my whole life seemed to change . I know it sounds ridiculous , but you made me feel like I 'd been cheated out of something all my life . It 's funny ... That movie out there does n't seem so bad with the sound turned off . In other words , you 'd like me to shut up . No . I 'd like you to do much more than that . Now you 've got me lost in the desert . I guess we 're all out here , searching . Even your wife ? I did n't sleep very well last night after I left you and now many things seem clearer to me . I do n't know if you 're still in love with your wife , but I do know that you have n't given up on your marriage . I know if we stop now , we 'll never do injury to anyone except possibly ourselves . I want to say goodbye , but not in a letter . So I 'll have to
zone1	all right ? - What ? Oh , I do n't know . Our cars being parked so close together ? Nobody uses this road . In fact , nobody knows this place except wild rabbits and squirrels , chipmunks and field mice , and birds and butterflies and ... - Falling leaves . - Which one of those are you ? I do n't know . Asquirrel , perhaps , or ... Maybe just a coward . I saved your letter . - You know , I realize something now , David . - What ? It was the proper way to say goodbye . - The only way . - Natalie . - Yes ? - Look at me . You know something ? Even if we never see each other again , something very good has happened , ' cause you 'll know for the rest of your life that ... Just the sight of you ... Just the sound of your voice created a feeling in me that was so strong that I could n't treat it as polite conversation or with silence . And I
zone1	searching young man , who passed through my life for a brief moment . And I loved his sadness , his loneliness , his searching . Please do n't . Well , I 'll make it easier . I 'm leaving here . I 'm going back to New York tonight . In three weeks , I accomplished all I set out to ... More than I intended . Will we be writing to each other ? - What do you think ? - No . Of course not . Welcome back . - I ordered for both of us . - Fine . I have n't studied your report , but I did glance through it briefly . Its thoroughness convinced me , that I 've no reason to be displeased with you for coming back so soon . You did what was expected of you . I 'm glad you agreed about Benziger . Fine man . However , that 's not what I wanted to talk about . We do n't want to be disturbed . I 'll get right to the point . Have you seen
zone1	Mountain City ? Mary ? No . I got home last night . She was still out on Long Island and she had n't returned when I left this morning . May I assume you 're aware of trouble in your home ? Would you care to be more specific ? Well , now , you see our Mr Hasbrouck who , as you know , has nothing but the highest regard for you happens to live in Westport , Connecticut . So it was inevitable he should hear about your wife 's presence at the home of a neighbor : MrAnd Mrs Joseph Cash . - Cash ? I do n't know them . - No , you do n't . But Dr . James Roper does , and it was there that he spent last weekend with your wife after the Princeton-Yale football game . You have my word , or Mr . Hasbrouck 's word , that that particular host and hostess make a practice of having a houseful of guests every weekend the attraction being that there 'll be no checking on who sleeps in which
zone1	can assure you that Mr Hasbrouck made quite certain your wife 's affair was an open secret before he invited Eugene St . John to lunch . - Eugene St . John ? - Their talk was most informal . St . John agreed to take no action right now , but he promised to speak to his daughter when you decided it was necessary or advisable and that is where the matter stands . That 's not where the matter stands where I 'm concerned . It 's none of this firm 's business what my wife does . I 'm surprised Mr St . John did n't tell Percy Hasbrouck to go to the devil . He probably realized what 's good for your future is good for his daughter 's . If there 's anything that he , I , or anyone can do to save your marriage he 's forit . - What if I do n't want to save it ? Then we 've failed . Then you have failed , Eaton . Divorce is a damnable thing . It violates good order . -
zone1	n't it just possible that infidelity might be grounds for a divorce ? There are no grounds for divorce . If you want my personal theology infidelity is the lesser sin . I 'd do anything in my power to prevent a divorce . Including condoning infidelity ? I consider your word " condon " disrespectful . I condone none of it . The problem of infidelity is between husband and wife and God . The problem of divorce concerns the whole of civilization . What is marriage ? An exchange of vows , a contract . It is my duty to myself and to any man working for me to demand that he honor all his contracts . When you came here you found out we always honor our word even if it means taking a loss . This is the first opportunity you 've had of putting yourself to our test . - And if I do n't meet your test ? You 've worked hard and well , Eaton . You have a fine , hard-earned record with us . You ca n't afford to throw that
zone1	. And I say with all due respect that you can afford nothing of the kind . I was n't going to tell you this . I did n't want it to form part of your decision , but I like you , Eaton , and I do n't want to lose you . Only you and I will know that I mentioned it at this early date . - Mentioned what ? - The roll-top desk . The partnership . I 've had discussions with the board and it 's only a question of time and much less now than you might suppose . Stay where you are , son . You 've a lot of thinking to do . But do n't do it all now . You 've had a bad time . Well , you 're back . - Was the trip successful ? - Yeah . Are you back for good or is this just a visit ? For good . Finished up sooner than you expected ? Sooner than you expected , too . Now that I 'm back you 'll have to start
zone1	all about you and Roper at the Cashes ' . I could subpoena everybody that was up there ... and divorce you in New York state . But you wo n't because Mr MacHardie would n't like that . You think you 're pretty clever , but you 're not . You flaunted your affair publicly . I do n't like a wife thumbing her nose at me . And I do n't like having a husband who is n't a husband . - What do you think you 're doing ? - What does it look like ? What do you expect me to do , enter a convent ? I 'm sure you 'll find yourself a woman , if you have n't already . You just better be careful . You 'd better be able to explain every minute of your time . Or you 'll do what ? I 'll put you where you 're afraid of landing in the tabloids , page one , two , or three . Take your choice ! I know why you 're doing this to me ! It 's
zone1	It 's your own sick dream of 5 million before you 're 40 ! Be the big man , bigger than your father ! Mr Eaton , will you go directly into the partners ' room , please ? Mr Duffy , please go directly into the partners ' room . Creighton , come in . Alfred , come in and sit down . Now , we 've been having a go at the Nassau proposal and we 've been taking under consideration Nassau 's request that we underwrite a common-stock issue to finance a plant expansion . Nassau obviously wants to expand , because they expect to land a sizable contract to manufacture their new E1-FX plane for the navy and it behooves us to look into this E1-FX to see how good an aircraft it is before we commit MacHardie and Company to getting involved . Sir , is n't the United States Navy 's interest in the planes sufficient endorsement for us ? Ordinarily it should be , but in this case my sixth sense tells me that we ought at least to conduct a routine investigation
zone1	as we have on our team a man so well qualified to do it . Alfred , you 're not only a personal friend of Alexander Porter , but you were associated with NAC in the days before it rose to prominence in the aircraft manufacturing field . Some people seem to think my departure from Nassau marked the beginning of its rise . Would n't we be placing Mr . Eaton in a rather embarrassing position by asking him to attempt to exercise impartial judgment where his close friend Mr Porter is concerned ? And who would you recommend for the job , Creighton ? Well , sir , in as much as I brought this venture to the firm 's attention and in as much as I 'm familiar with all of its ramifications ... I have every confidence in Mr Eaton 's judgment and loyalty . Alfred , how long will it take you to get this underway ? By a fortunate coincidence , Mrs Eaton and I will be at Mr . Porter 's table at a charity ball Saturday . There 's no rule saying
zone1	is there ? I 'd like to say I 'm close to everything that goes on at Nassau , but I 'm just the titular head . If you 'll pardon the expression . Thanks to Uncle Fritz ' money I reap the dividends , the profits , and the credit . Yes , thanks . Von Elm 's the real brains . He 'll give you all the facts you need . - Can you set it up ? - I 'll see you get the run of the place . Thanks . - Can I ask you a corny question ? - If you do n't mind a corny answer . Are you getting anything out of yoursuccess besides more success ? Why do n't you say what you mean ? - All right . Let'stalk about Mary . - Nothing to talk about . Things any better ? They 're not any worse . They 'll never get any better . - I 'm not interested . - I 'm not good enough for you ? You might say that . You wo n't be the first
zone1	to go back to the table . He does n't even know you 're alive what perfume you 're wearing or how gorgeous you are . Everyone knows it . So do you . - Let go of me , please . - Do n't act . I know all about you . Do you ? Alfred , would you take me home , please ? I thought you were having a merry old time . - Good night . it was delightful . - Good night , princess . - you were a charming host . - But corny ? - Get my car , please . - Yes , sir . - Hello , Natalie . - Hello . It 's nice to see you again . Do you know my wife Mary ? Natalie Benziger . - How do you do , Mrs Eaton ? - Hello , miss Benziger . - What brings you to New York ? - a little shopping expedition . Are you here with your mother ? No . With a friend : Mrs English . Caroline English . - How 's
zone1	. Where did you two know each other in Philadelphia ? I tried to sell Natalie 's father some bonds that time when I was down in Mountain City . - In Pennsylvania , remember ? - Yes , I remember . Well , good night , Mrs Eaton . It 's very nice meeting you . - Good night , Natalie . - Good night . Well , and what does she call you ? Miss Benziger . She calls me Mrs Eaton and you call her Natalie , but she does n't call you anything . Are n't you Mr Eaton or Alfred ? As a matter of fact , I 'm Calvin Coolidge , but she does n't know that . She 's really quite lovely , you know . - And you know me . I like men . - So I 'm told . When she 's that lovely , I find it hard to hate her . - I think you were lucky . - I was ? Yes . She has something I have n't got ... Niceness . - But then I
zone1	No . Honesty and guts . She has no guts . What are you doing ? Do n't worry . I 'm not calling your girl friend . I do n't have to . Dr Roper , please . Hello , Jim ? Remember me ? Exactly . Look , why do n't we have dinner sometime ? Tomorrow night ? Are n't I , though ? Fine . I 'll meet you at your place . Marvelous . Any objections ? I have no facts and no evidence , so this is what I 'm going to do . - It 's all I can do . - Just like that ? Yes , just like that . I let you talk to foremen , designers , mechanics , public relations men . Everybody but the test pilot . I 'm sure they told you everything they know . They were instructed to be cooperative . I 'll bet they were . Everybody 's been very helpful . E1-FX is the greatest plane to ever sprout wings . Maybe it can fly , too . - What am I
zone1	to say anything . Before I go back to Wall Street and report the failure of a mission , I 'll give you one hour to produce this test pilot that 's been so mysteriously busy . - Suppose I ca n't find him . Then you 're in the wrong business . - Do n't think that wo n't be in my report , too . - Wait a minute . - Get Kelly In here . - Yes , sir . If somebody like me did n't know you well , they 'd figure you to walk in here with a whole set of prejudices against us . You left this company when it was nothing because you thought it would always be nothing . I 'm glad I 'm known so well by somebody like you . Come in . You sent for me , sir ? This is Jerry Kelly , our test pilot . - I think Mr Kelly And I will take a walk . - What do you mean , a walk ? That 's where you put one foot in front of
zone1	I 'll make it up to you . I intend to make you do that . Every time I 'm with you this way I get the strangest feeling . - Well , I 'm a strange man . - Are you ? - And you 're a strange woman . - How am I strange ? - Have n't you discovered that yet ? - No . Well , I 'll let you find out . Jim . Do you love me ? Love you ? Honey , I adore you but I do n't believe in love any more than you do . I believe in you wanting me and me wanting you . That 's what brings you here and that 's what will keep us together . Then I do n't suppose there 's any sense in us talking about marriage or even thinking about it . Look , let 's have no more talk about love or eternal devotion , shall we ? Jim ! Want me . Please want me . Oh , David ... The first real thing in a whole long year
zone1	really why I came to New York . Well , I 'm glad you did . I 've been wondering ... Wondering about so many things . - you have ? - Yes . Your wife , she 's lovelier than I thought she 'd be . And you 're still with her , are n't you ? We live under the same roof . That 's all . David , is there someplace we can go ? So there it is . Or there it was . I could have divorced her for it . I could have , but I did n't , because it would have meant damaging my career . God help me . My career seems to be more important than I ever thought it could be . I put you out of my mind and buried myself in my work even deeper than before . But I guess it never really worked , because whenever I thought of you , it was ... It was always with love . Then the other night , the moment I saw you , it was like seeing
zone1	danger for both of us . You see , that 's why ... I wish I 'd had the courage not to phone you . So be careful , Natalie . I have nothing to offer you except pain . Deep , tender , loving pain ... And I do n't want to hurt you . - you understand what I 'm trying to say ? - Yes , I do . If you had any sense you 'd get up from the table and never see me again . - do you want me to ? Oh , David . I ca n't bear being with you any longer , just talking . - Is there someplace we Can go ? - No , Natalie . - a hotel ? - You would n't like that . No , neither would you . But arrange it , darling , please . Busy , busy , busy . How 's the Nassau Investigation going ? Do n't you want to wait for my report ? Only if I have to . Do n't worry . You 'll get the whole
zone1	their test pilot , a fellow named Kelly ? That 's right . You saved my son 's life once . You might want to do the same for his old man . You skate on thin ice , you 'll get your feet wet . Were n't you skating on thin ice last night making love in public to a young lady who bears no resemblance to your wife ? You should be more careful . Wait a minute . Let 's be a little realistic . We may want to do each other a big favor . Do me a favor . Get out of the way . You know as well as I do that Mr Machardie has some hidebound notions about improper behavior around here . - like the improper way you tried to turn the Nassau deal into your own private game ? I got proof I plan to put before the board tomorrow . Oh , you would n't do that , because if you do , you go with me . You and your plaything . - Why do n't you go jump
zone1	That 's how you got into this company in the first place . Sir , could I interest you in a set of the Encyclopaedia Britannica ? - Step right this way , young lady and we will discuss the matter . - Thanks . Oh , darling , hold on to me . Do n't let me run away . I almost did n't come . I turned back twice . You know , we do n't have to stay here . We could go for a walk or out for dinner , go to the ... Champagne ? Come here . - Look . - It 's lovely . You know , I think I 'm going to remember this night for all time . And someday , when we finally part , I 'll go to Spain and live with my memories . As soon as I see you getting tired of me . You 'll be too old to travel when that happens . I love you . More than I ever thought I could love anybody . I love you , David . - Message
zone1	more of the girl . - I got plenty . - Let 's go . Come on , let 's go ! Why do I feel this ... - this kind of death ? - of what ? I do n't know . You were just thinking of what your mother and father would feel , if they saw one of those photographs of us . I was n't thinking that , and I wo n't let you . Ca n't keep it out of your mind forever . Unless I play ball with Duffy tomorrow , you 're going to be undressed in public , smeared all over the newspapers . I do n't care . Believe me . I knew what I was doing . I 've got to accept the consequences , whatever they are . I wo n't let them do it to you . Not to me . If you 're going to let that man blackmail you , it 's to protect your career . Everything you 've worked for , not me . You see ? That 's the death I feel .
zone1	n't there ? Why you did it , for whom . Well , I do n't think I could live with that . Ca n't we end this kind of talk ? You 're very close to saying final things . Maybe they have to be said . Maybe there never really was any future for us and it took your friend Mr Duffy to wake us up from the dream . You know what you 're doing , do n't you ? Sending me back to Mary and yourself back to Mountain City . Is that what you want ? Well , if it is , why do n't you say so ? Because the moment I do ... I 'll feel that my life is over . You 're trying to force me to say it , then . I guess maybe I am . All right , then ... If that 's the way you want it . Goodbye , Natalie . Goodbye . Is something wrong ? Anything you want to unload ? The least I can do is listen . You know something , Alfred
zone1	ship , if you 'd just unbend a little . - What kind of relation ship ? What ever we like . Of course , I know there 's no love lost between us , but ... If you 'd just stop playing the role of the aggrieved husband , we might have the same enjoyable relation ship ... that a lot of our married friends have . Well , I 've seen you look at me when I knew you wanted me and I certainly wanted you . And you just turned around and walked back in your own bedroom . I always thought , He 's such a fool , such a waste . - Now , would n't it be nicer if we were friends this way ? - Shut up . You look like an old man tonight , Alfred . What 's the matter , is your girl friend giving you trouble ? I do n't want to talk about it . I hope you have n't been stringing her along and telling her you were going to get a divorce . Knowing women ,
zone1	she 's angry because you wo n't . I always knew she had no guts . Well , am I wrong ? Is your girl friend holding out on you and demanding marriage ? Mary , please . If it 'll do you any good you can tell her it 's not just your boss man who 's standing in your way . You can tell her that you also have a wife who happens to like her marital arrangement and does n't intend to change it . Why not ? It gives me status , security and a wonderful kind of freedom . Well , why are you staring at me ? When I think of the misery that we 've brought each other , the wasted years , betrayals , humiliations ... I 'm not blaming you for it . I guess I did as much as you did to destroy whatever we had between us , but it 's gone now . It 's beyond recovery , dead . That 's all right . We do n't need it . As a matter of fact , maybe
zone1	going to bed now , Alfred . I 'm really not that bad , remember ? - Mr Eaton ? - Yeah . Sign here , please . Thank you . Before we hear Mr Eaton 's report on the Nassau Aeronautical Corporation situation , I have a few words to say of a very happy nature . All right , Henry . I know you 'll forgive me for breaking one of our more tire some traditions , if I decorate this stale but profitable room today with the presence of an attractive young lady . Gentlemen , Mrs Alfred Eaton . How do you do ? Right over there , Mary . Mrs Eaton was let into our little secret , several days ago and if I may judge by the look of surprise on her husband 's face she 's kept her secret better than most women are considered capable of doing . Now , Alfred , I come to something which is no secret and that is the high esteem in which you are held by this firm . I speak not only for myself ,
zone1	to your work with a devotion that might serve as an example to all young men who aspire to success . You have sacrificed your own pleasures and pastimes for us . You have traveled all over the country for us . You 've sat at your desk until 3:oo and 4:00 in the morning forus . And time and again you have executed difficult assignments with more boldness and courage than we had any right to expect . Not only that . And this is especially important . You have made us proud of your performance in the private walks of your life as well . I think you know what I mean now . There you have conducted yourself with a wisdom , maturity , good taste and a fine sense of responsibility to your business position . And soon , I think you 'll see why it was worth it . It 's now time to be specific . As long we were all going to be assembled here today I thought this would be the proper occasion to tell you before you read about it in
zone1	first man , on the sunny side of 40 , ever to be made a full partner of Machardie and Company . Congratulations , Alfred . Congratulations . Congratulations , Mrs Eaton . Congratulations . Now , then ... Mr Machardie ... Gentlemen , I ... I am deeply honored . I 'm flattered by your generous bestowal of a partnership ' cause this is a day that I have been working toward with every fiber of my being . For like all well-brought-up American males I have always been aware of the fact that nothing is more important in life than the attaining of wealth and high position . And I can honestly say that I never allowed anything to sway me from my goal of achieving it . When business called , I never let personal responsibilities stand in the way . If anything ever threatened to interfere with the affairs of Machardie and Company , I always knew that there would only be one choice and I invariably made it . Because I have truly learned , gentlemen , as Mr Machardie so gracefully put it ,
zone1	and a fine sense of responsibility to one 's business position if one is to get ahead in this world . Some men think in very small terms , gentlemen . If they find themselves married to a woman , who has been unfaithful to them , they dissolve the marriage just as if they owed no responsibility to the business firm for which they worked . And if they find genuine happiness with another woman they embrace it as if they had no consideration of their business colleagues . These men do not become successful , gentlemen . They do not become full partners at Machardie and Company . They become abject failures . They take their place alongside the millions of mediocrities who value a houseful of kids , a host of friends , photograph albums filled with trivial memories above all the truly important considerations of this world . With all due modesty , gentlemen , I feel that I have earned the position you have given me today . No one here deserves it more truly than I . - One second ... - I 'm
zone1	will be to deliver my report on the Nassau Aeronautical situation . And after you 've read it , I 'm quite sure that my friend Mr Duffy there will want to issue another report on another subject namely , the newest partner of MachHardie and Company , the newest and possibly the shortest-lived . And , now , if you will excuse me I have other , less important business to attend to . - Sorry . - What ... - What Is the meaning of this ? - What 's the matter with him ? Alfred . I know you 've come to congratulate me . Thank you . - You 're making a fool of yourself . - That was terribly considerate of you last night when you were telling me " about the " " beautiful relation ship " " we could have " but you never mentioned the partner ship . Because maybe I would 've thought the partner ship had something to do with your new-found if somewhat unwholesome interest in our marriage . Alfred . Alfred , I want to talk to you
zone1	through legal channels . - Alfred . Go to her . It wo n't do you any good . If she 's foolish enough , nothing will stop me from spending my life with her . I 'll never give you a divorce . Wait till you see the photographs Mr Duffy will release for public consumption . - What photographs ? You wo n't be able to show your face in this city if you do n't give me a divorce . How do you like them apples ?

Go ahead . - Pull her up . - I ca n't . She wo n't lift . Strap in . Got to set her down . I ca n't see five feet ahead of me . Ready for crash . Damn it , the radio 's out . - Are you alright ? - It 's just my arm . Let me get him out . Get the baggage . Stay put . I 've got to help Pierre . Never mind . Come on ! We 're going to get you out of here . Find some kind of cover . - What about the
zone1	edge of a cliff . The wind may blow her off any minute . Hang on . Here we go . John , Robert , come on ! There 's a dry spot here . Come on ! Hang on . I think Pierre found a shelter . Good man , I never doubted you . Searched her down safely . Are you guys kidding ? We were darn lucky . Help ! Help ! Do n't move . We 'll pull you up . - Take hold of my ankle . - No Pierre , I 'm stronger . - I can still bring the buzzard to roost - I 'm lighter , hang onto me . What are you doing ? Are you two out of your minds ? Come back ! I 've got to get lower . He ca n't reach me . Reckless fools . I ... I am most indebted to you . You saved my life . - May I ask who are you ? - Kamal Achmed ben Haghir This is John , he got hurt . This is Pierre and I
zone1	wilderness ? Yes I do . I am of the tribe of Taha . Why are you wandering around this desolate region by yourself ? - The storms scattered my caravan . - Your caravan ? - I 'll be darned . We were circling ... - Trying to warn you , you were heading directly into the atomic explosion area . Have n't you been ordered to stay clear of this zone ? We are nomads . There are no restricted zones for nomads ? You must be the master of the desert . Now look here Farouk . Can you lead us out into civilization ? Yes ... Yes Sir . I can guide you to Wadi el Kebir . - As soon as the rain subsides . - How long will it take us ? Two days , perhaps more . There towards the western horizon . And all we can do is sit here and rot and wait . What a ball I would have set up for all of us in Cairo . It 's just around this boulder . - That 's good .
zone1	. You need rest . There 's a cavern in this mass of rock . Sip it whilst it 's hot . It will soothe the pain . By tomorrow morning you 'll be much improved . Thank you . You 're very considerate . Pierre ! Hey , take a look at this Hard as diamonds . I 've never seen anything like that before . I need n't explain this to you gentlemen . This bit of stone is nothing to be excited over . Just some ordinary metal . Are you kidding . I 'm a mining engineer . I know what this stuff is . It 's valueless . A common ore . I 'll make a deal with you . I wo n't teach you about horses , do n't teach me about minerals . Pierre , we must act fast . and clinch an option for mining rights here . - You ca n't do that . - What do you mean by that ? We do n't sell such rights . I 'm beginning to understand now . what you 're really trying
zone1	will not let you touch an inch of this . We 're obviously not getting through to each other . If you think a casual threat is going to stop us ... You will find ... that my threat is far from casual . You may be right . We are excited . We all went through a rough ordeal . Let him go . What can he do ? Come on Pierre , look at this . It scales off in small layers . There 's no trace of oxidation . He can make much difficulty for us . Alright I 'll apologize . But do n't you know what this is ? He never did explain how he and his men happened to be so close to the explosion area . - What are you driving at ? - I do n't know , but ... Somehow or other ... I have the feeling He 's not just the chief of a small band of desert nomads . Well , who do you think he is ? I think we ought to try and find out . Alright
zone1	. If he does n't come back , who 'll get us across the desert . You ? Relax . I 'm sure we 'll manage . You had to insult him . I wish I were in Paris right now . Pierre , let 's stop the nonsense . Let 's get some sleep . Stop ! I want them alive . We 're prisoners alright . Well , Pierre . Are you convinced ? - What is it , - I do n't know . It does n't seem possible . - Come on Pierre , what 's on your mind ? - Something unbelievable . Something fantastic . Well , this is the place for it . - Why the honour of this visit ? - You bandit ! - After we saved your life . - Get a hold of yourself John . Why are we being held ? - I meant to lead you to safety . - But what changed your mind ? Your insolence . But also the discovery you made in the cavern . I told you , you 'd get your
zone1	the mineral deposits ? Where are we ? Where have you brought us ? To Atlantis . Atlantis ? What kind of a joke is this ? Perhaps you should ask him . Maybe his sense of humour is more developed . Maybe he understands this kind of joke . What 's he raving about Pierre ? He may be telling the truth . Atlantis did not disappear without leaving a trace . What do you mean ? The legend is wrong in one detail . Atlantis did not sink into the sea . It settled in the sand . the very sand of this desert . You want me to believe , an entire continent would suddenly sink underground ? Thousands of years ago the ocean , reached up to these very mountains . There was one of the most violent earthquakes ever known . When it was over , the ocean had fallen back , to its present shores , leaving behind it ... desert rock . This desolation . And slowly over the centuries the sands covered the ruins of Atlantis . Buried them ... for all
zone1	these caverns . What 's left of that empire has existed here for centuries . And will continue so . That 's fine with me . I do n't give a darn about Atlantis . All I want is to get out of here . So do I . I regret that that does not depend upon me . On whom then ? Antinea The last queen of Atlantis/ How can that be ? Antinea was the name of the last ruler of Atlantis before the earthquake . Since then her spirit lives again in every young woman destined to take her throne . For once , I can agree with you . You sure know how to pick ' em . This is the man who saved my life . The life of Kamal Achmed ben Heghir is very precious to me . We thank you . You must not thank me . We all did what we could . We thank you all . You will be our guest . Our very welcome guests . We do n't want to seem ungrateful But if you do n't mind
zone1	- I 'm afraid you have no choice . - You 've already said that before . Would you want us to remain here against our will ? - Kamal 's decisions are also mine . - What are you really after ? - Now if it 's ransom ... - You are being rude . No . Let him go on . - You 're making things worse . - Do n't you want to get out of here ? Do n't you understand . All we want is to get out of this weird ... - this strange world of yours . - There is no other world . Only this . You 're condemning us to .. to this living death ? Which tomb do you have reserved for us ? We will take care of that my friend . We will find a place for you . The Gondwara mountains accommodate many like you . Did you say the Gondwara ? Are we in the Gondwara ? You must set us free . We 're all in danger . It 's true . They 're going
zone1	us get to the base to warn them that you people are living here . We 'll all be buried alive . You must believe us . These caverns will collapse like cards . Nothing can destroy them . They 've been here for thousands of years . They ca n't resist . And we 'll die of radiation . - Are you finished ? - No I 'm not . Let us go . It 's for your sake . We must get to the command before the blast is set off . Take them away . Not him . Let him stay . You 're a rude man . - Do you always treat women like that ? - I do n't know . Maybe I 've been lucky . But you are mad . All of you . You 're dangerous . People like you should be put away under lock and key . Do n't you realise that you are playing with the lives of human beings ? You do n't understand our rites . Our culture has survived the ages . Try to understand .
zone1	you , no . I want no part of it . - You have no choice . No man has ever left Atlantis alive . You too must accept it . In time . To be given every attention , like respected guests . Yes master . - I do n't want Zena to go . - Get out of her way . Do n't be afraid . You must restrict yourself to serving . Do not answer any of their questions . I 'm sure they will ask many . Just listen . Tarath , I wo n't tolerate you questioning my orders . Zena was promised to me by you . I have spoken to her since you asked me . She has still to make up her mind . What happens if the strangers turn her head ? What do you fear ? She 's a reliable girl . - Do n't you trust Zena ? - How can I ? She 's an innocent girl . She 's not Antinea . - Do n't be insolent . - You do n't understand . You 've trained
zone1	the horses ready . I 'll be back before nightfall . How many men will you need ? Six will be enough and ten horses for supplies . Is the schedule in the mine OK ? Or should we seize replacements for those lost in the storm ? Do n't bother . I have ways to keep things moving . Wind velocity 48 kilometres . South west by south . All observation posts stand by for further instructions . Wind velocity ... 48 kilometres , south west by south . All observation posts ... Please , you should eat something . Come along you . Where are you taking him ? What do you want with him ? Hold it John . D' you want to get us killed Come on . I 'll be back . - Do you know where they 're taking him ? - No . Nothing . - Do n't lie . You know . - Take it easy . What do you want from her ? He meant no harm . We 're all under a terrible strain . Please let me serve you
zone1	name is Zena . - It 's an unusual name . - But I like it . - I also come from the outside . You are very kind . I 'm sorry you 're being kept here . I 'll be back soon . I was hoping you 'd send for me . - Where is Antinea ? - In her apartment . She 's alone now . - What do you mean now ? - I took her to him this morning . - You did what ? - It was Antinea 's order . They spent the whole day together . - Where is he now ? - I 'm holding him . In my quarters for you . Have him returned to the others immediately . Open . He 's dead . Who authorized this ? - Who authorized this ? - We caught this man in the corridors . Attempting to escape from here . Tarath ordered this . Take him to the golden cavern . Advise Tarath of this order . I met Zanussi 's caravan . In ten days they will return with
zone1	about ... caravans and supplies . You seem upset . Is there something you wish to ask me ? Is there something I should ask you ? Your spy Karaka told you . - I urged you not to see him . - It 's for me to decide . And to do . I 've never interfered with you before . whatever you wished to do , I stood aside and permitted it . Now ! - For the first time I ask you ... - You have no right to ask . Why do you talk of right ? It was I who found you . A child ... Amongst the lowliest . From that moment on I loved you . I made you the supreme symbol of my life . Of Atlantis . Yes . And I have paid you in full . What more do you want ? In all these years , I have allowed you to use me . Exactly as you please . I will not give him up . I ca n't . I shall not allow it . You are part
zone1	forsake this . I can . Believe me I can . I want to live . I 'm younger , much younger than you are . I know . I 've known him only a few days . Yet Robert means more to me than you after all these years . You are in love . Yes . Many times I 've predicted that love would come into your life . This is in the nature of every woman . Selfishly , I had hoped you would come to love me . - I never told you I loved you . - No . Now I realise you never said it . You 've listened well to him . You voice his thoughts . Let me express mine . To be really in love , means you may be deeply hurt . Look at me . Look well . I dread what it might do to you . - I 'm not afraid . - Listen . I know this type of boy . Strong , yet soft in a way . Made ruthless by his struggle to survive in
zone1	his might have to destroy your self respect . If your great love ... makes you unselfish then you will end human bondage . Is our dream of Atlantis and its queen to be ended ? Is all this once again to become the rubble I once found ? - Stop it please . - Are n't you risking too much ? Is n't your life ... all this , my own existence far too great a price to pay for what you think is love ? What others may call our dream for us must be reality . Robert ! What happened ? they took me to Antinea and I 've been locked up in Terat 's quarters . - What did she want from you ? - Pierre . Not that again . I warned you not to touch her . I begged you ... begged you . What 's wrong with you ? Are you crazy ? Antinea 's no pleasing for guys like you . I 'm sorry Pierre . We 're acting like fools . We ca n't fight amongst ourselves . Come on .
zone1	. - I 've been by myself for hours . - Escaped ? How ? He slipped out of here . Shortly after they took you away . What were you doing up there ? Trying to go after her ? I searched every inch of this room . For a way to get out . Up there , the stones are loose . I made a hole . Now , we can get out . We 've got to find John . There is no escape from Atlantis . I hope we can get to him before he gets into real trouble . I 'm sorry Pierre . You 'll have to stay here . We ca n't give them a chance to catch us both . I 'll use your rope to cross the gorge . Seein ' ya . You fiend ! Back ! One ... Two ... Three ... You fellows get back . You two take the prisoners . Move that wheel ? Move ! Right , stop . Let him see what he can expect . Right there , I 'm coming . Get
zone1	the wheel . Somebody help me . Seize him ! Get back to work . Why is it your business ? I 'll teach you to be a hero . Kill the guards ! You 'll stay down there for a good long while . And save your strength if you do n't want to drown . - Can you hang on ? - Yeah . It 's not the first time for me . - How did you get here ? - They kidnapped me a month ago . I 'm a sergeant of the Atomic detachment . If you let go , it 's the finish . I wo n't . He 's very concerned about his friends . Only you can make it easier for him . Again you speak of one thing and mean another . Why do you treat me like a child ? I do not . I only ask you to help him , please . He must not suffer . I will send him to you . She will see you . Go on . Come closer . I regret that no
zone1	. They are alive . They fled into the desert . But my men are pursuing them . I hope they will find them before they die from thirst and fatigue . You still seem worried . What more can I do ? Nothing . I 'm afraid I have only myself to blame . Why do you feel it is your fault ? I should have known better . Yes , I 've been utterly stupid . By my silence , I 've made john 's escape possible . Also I discovered and prepared the place for Robert to flee from the cavern . You are Robert 's close friend ? I 've known him for many years . We are like brothers . I owe him a lot . - I would do anything for him . - Why did n't you try to escape with him ? We had an argument . It was all my fault . Is it always your fault with him ? - Why should I believe you ? - She laughs . I tell you , John is dead . And Robert
zone1	condemned to the mines ? It 's impossible . - Why would she lie to me ? Why ? - You must believe . I only tell you what is true . You must escape . - We 've got so little time . - But that 's impossible . - D' you know what you 're saying ? - Yes . I overheard the reports on Tamal 's radio . They plan to explode the bomb today . Tomorrow . You must get out and notify the command of what is happening here . You 're the only one left . It 's our only chance . If you delay ... Robert ... you ... All of us are doomed . Please . Let me help you . I know a way out of here . Please ... Trust me . But why would you betray Antinea ? And everyone here ? Because I do n't belong here . They kidnapped me , five years ago . From my village in the hills . Now , more than ever I want to go on living . I do n't
zone1	you die . You 're so young . I 'll go with you . We all must live . I 've planned and schemed a long time . The men we can trust are willing to try it . You remember , there 's a river in the mine . It enters through an opening in the rocks . Go on . The river ... cuts ... into the hillside out there . At some point and I think I know where Of course , you must be right . With a rope and hook , we can overcome any obstacle on the river bed . - Whatever route it may take . - It make sense . But the opening through the mine into the river ... is too narrow . We need a drill to open it yet more . I know something that works much faster . And I think we can get it . Lower , lower ! Everybody put a workspace up . Section Two , take your implements . Work stations like yesterday . No loafing . Everybody 's ready . - Right I
zone1	Push ! One ... Two ... Three ... The guard below us , he 's got a machine gun . I 'm sick . They 've killed two guards . They 've got the machine gun . Sound the alarm ! They 're killing the guards . Call for reinforcements . Get the rope . Keep down now . Here they are ! Work faster . Before they call more guards again . Cover us ! Go after every guard . Keep firing . The guards wo n't dare attack if the bullets fly . - Ready ? - Yes . Take cover ! I 'll break you into the ground ! They 're blasting their way out . Do n't be afraid . Into the river . Follow on . We 're right behind you . Hold your guns over you heads . Well , thank god we 're free . Give me the rope . Max and I go down first , fellows . The you follow and we cover you . Keep out of site until we hit the ground . You understand fellows ? Follow orders

zone1	been abroad and ... sometimes I think I 've never seen anything , sticking at home . Well , I suppose there comes a time in most chaps ' lives when they have to make out for themselves , especially if they want to make headway . Yeah . The best time to do a thing like that 's when you 're still single . - I suppose so . - Aye . - Before you get tied down . - Aye . Mind , if you do think it 's best then for you to make a move , it 's up to you . I do n't want you to think there 's anyone here holding you back . No , I see that , Dad . I see that . Is it serious , then , this lass ? No , I just go about with her , that 's all . Your mother seems to think it is serious . - Well , she imagines things . - Aye . You did n't go down there last night , then , Geoffrey ? No , then
zone1	Hey , Frank , just a minute . Here . You wo n't recognise this one , will you ? - It 's not your lad , is it ? - It bloody is . Well , you 've fattened out , then . How 's work going down ? - All right . - He 's doing well . He 's doing fine . They think a lot of him down there . Well , I 'll have to be getting along , Dad , you know or I 'll be late . You do n't want a new clerk , do you ? Eeh , I do n't know . They do n't know when they 're well off , do they ? They do n't , and you ca n't tell ' em owt either . You 've still got him up at home , have you ? Well , up to press we have . He 's got some lass hanging round him , though . - He 's big enough . - And bloody daft enough . I 'm sorry I 'm late , love
zone1	made it anyway . No , only I had to go down to Beulah Road to the blood donation centre . - The what ? - You know , blood . They came round work , did n't they , asking for people ? Yeah , that 's right . Oh , can I have a coffee , please ? - Anything else ? - Do you want anything ? - Only just had my tea . - No , just one , please . No , they came round to the typists , asking , but I would n't go . - Ca n't stand the sight of blood . - Well , you do n't see it . You do . I 've seen it on telly . " Call Dr Martin " . They have this bottle hanging from above the bed . That 's a transfusion , you stupid girl . Who do you think you 're talking to ? No , you do n't see anything . It does n't hurt . You would n't get me to go . Anyway , you get off
zone1	and a biscuit . It 's all in a good cause . You never know when it might be your turn . Oh , shut up , Vic . Honestly , I just hate the thought of hospitals . I ca n't stand ' em . I do n't know why I watch " Call Dr Martin " every week , because I 'm always waiting for something awful to happen . - Did you see it last week ? - No . Oh , I do wish you 'd watch it . It 's quite good really . No , because they 've got this new sister , Sister Fairlie , and she 's supposed to be in love with Dr ... What 's his name ? Not Dr Martin . The tall one . Well , of course , his wife 's paralysed from the waist down . I think if she died it 'd be best for everybody . Oh , hello , Ingrid . Oh , hello . Bet she 's surprised to see me here . She 's been keeping out of my way ever
zone1	this afternoon , and if I know him , every word will have gone straight back to her . Still , it does n't bother me . Well , he comes walking in at half past four , with this great big pile of letters he wants typing and I 'd already got four statements to type . So , I just said to him straight out , " Why do n't you ask Marjorie to do it ? " " Oh , " he says , " Marjorie 's got enough on her plate . " I said , " Mm , it 's funny Marjorie 's always got enough on her plate " when there 's a last-minute job on . " And , honestly , Vic , she spends more time in that cloakroom messing about with her face than anyone I know . I think Mr Everton 's a bit gone on her . Course , anyone can get him if they set about it the right way . Just look helpless . You ought to see Marjorie , the way she looks at him all
zone1	You have n't been listening to a word I 'm saying . Yes , of course I have . You were talking about work . Talk to yourself around here . Did you get my birthday card ? Oh , yes , thanks , love . I 'm sorry I forgot to mention it . Would you like to get me some more coffee ? Yes , would you like anything else ? - No , thanks . - Right . Another coffee , please . Well , the money does n't go into your pocket , does it ? - What 's this ? - Open it and see . Many happy returns . Thank you . - Do you like it ? - Yes , it 's lovely . It really is . It 's lovely . You should n't have done it . Well , I knew you had n't got one . Well , it 's just what I needed . You 're a funny lad , Vic . Do you think so ? Yes , and I love you . Well , that 's all
zone1	? Have n't you got anything to say ? - Vic ? - Mm ? I thought at first , just now ... that you wanted to , you know , do everything . Yeah , I might have . I was n't daft enough to try . I wonder if it 's anything like that . I suppose it must be . I do n't know . I wondered . You know Irene at work ? That girl with the long hair in our office . She just wo n't believe me when I tell her I do n't know what it 's like . She 's always telling me . She 's awful . You ought to hear some of the jokes she tells . Honestly , she 's got a one-track mind . She 's going out with Sidney Chapman . You know , she is funny . She goes dancing three nights every week , only she does n't like dancing , really . She just sits at the table . I suppose a lot of people do that , though , do n't they ?
zone1	point in it , myself . Come on , let 's go . Oh , these shoes . Just a minute , Vic . Just a minute ! Bacon , mash potatoes . - Beef , please . - Cold beef and mash potatoes . Anyway , I was telling you about this boy . He 's in his car , like , and he said , d' you know , if we wanted to go out , we could . - Saved a seat for you , Vic . - Thanks , love , all the same . But they 've got one for me over there . Have you seen " Oh What A Clanger " at the Regal yet ? Yeah , I went last night with Bob . Have you seen it ? No , not yet . I was supposed to go with my mother on Saturday . But she 's had to go away for a few days . You know , my auntie 's ill . - What a shame . - Anyway , I might go with Dorothy . I see there
zone1	, Saturday . Yeah , well , if he goes , we 've had it . - Mm , second division for us . - You can say that again . You dirty low-down no-good Yankee draughtsman , draw ! I 'm not afraid to die for Mary-Lou . We could have picked them birds up . They were looking round at us . They were looking round at the row you were making , more likely . We 'll get chucked out of there , one of these days . Where are we going now , then ? Gala Rooms ? - How about a game of snooker ? - What , again ? Why not ? I 'll give you two blacks , play you for the table , then I 'm going home . Hark at Joe Davis . Hello , Vic . Hello . What are you doing here ? - Vic , I had to see you . - You see me every day at work . No , Vic , you 've been avoiding me , you have n't spoken to me all week
zone1	weeks . - What 's wrong ? What have I done ? - Nothing . No , I 've been busy , you know . I 've had a lot to do . A friend of mine came over and he stayed longer than we expected . - Is it something I 've said or done ? - No , nothing . It 's rotten being a girl , sometimes . I 'm sorry , love . - What are you doing tomorrow ? - Going to the match . It 's cup tie . What about Sunday , then ? All right , I can come Sunday . I 'll see you in the park , same place . I thought you did n't care for me any more . I 'll see you Sunday , then . OK . Good night , Vic . Two , four ! Three , four ! Can we have a recall ? B-O-L-T-O-N ! Bolton ! Get out the way , you fool ! Get it between the posts ! Hey ! Mavis ! Could n't you get a bloke to bring
zone1	and sharpen your pencil . I 've been watching you trying to get off with that goalkeeper . - Hey , who 's that , then ? - Bird . - She 's all right , is n't she ? - Course she 's all right . You 'll be all right too , mate . Stick with me . - Yeah ? - Where we going tonight , then ? Chatty , are n't they ? Well , do n't speak , will you ? Here , how about tomorrow , then ? Ignorant slags . Listen , are you OK if I get them fixed up ? - No , I ca n't . I 'm fixed up already . - Oh , well , pull the ladder up . - Who with ? - A bird . You 're not still on with that , are you ? You 're better off with these two . I do n't know so much about that . She must have changed , then . I thought she was one of the untouchables . Well , it depends how you
zone1	! Come here ! Where have you been ? " Stick with me , " he says . You wo n't go short if you do . There 's plenty more where they came from . Go on . Hey , when did you last make the grade ? Couple of months ago . Yeah , in your flipping imagination . - You want to be careful , you know . - I always am . - Are you ? - Yes . Go on . You 're all right . There 's a man serving . Go on , then . - Small . - Right . Anything else ? - Oh , and some cough mixture . - Right . Yes ? Can I help you , sir ? - Oh ! - I n't it awful ? - You look like a drowned rat . - I feel like one . - Where shall we go , then ? - Well , my mother 's gone away . You can come home and dry off if you like . All right . - I 'm not ticklish
zone1	not . - I bet you are . See . - Oh ! - What 's the matter ? - I 've scratched myself . - Have you ? - I 'm sorry , love . - What 's that ? - Can I look ? - Hey , give it to me . - Not till I 've seen what it is . - Give it me . No . All right , then , have a look . See if I care . Oh . You mucky devil . Why ? Well , you are , carrying a book like this . I do n't know how they can do it , posing like this . It 's just a job . I 'd like to know what goes on in these studios . She 's lovely , though . Is n't she firm ? - She 's no nicer than you are . - Get away . Well , I think your figure 's just as good as hers . Look at her bust , though . Bet she does n't need a bra . I think
zone1	so . Yes , well , we wo n't go into details . I wish we could . You want a lot , do n't you ? Ingrid , you know how I feel about you . That 's the trouble . I do n't know . Nobody 's ever got me this way before . You do n't always feel like that , though , do you ? You 're not bothered about me . I do n't know what I do feel half the time . That 's the trouble . Sometimes I feel rotten about it all . Sometimes I think it 's not fair on either of us . And sometimes I feel like I do now . Yes . I know . - Do you want to pack it in ? - No . I do n't want to pack it in . - What 's the matter ? - Somebody might come ... Your mother 's gone away , has n't she ? Yes , I know , but the neighbours ... - Lock the door . - I have done . If somebody
zone1	. - Vic . - Come on , Ingrid . Come on . It 's nothing , you know , really . Not to you , perhaps , but it is to me . I think of nothing else sometimes . Well , I ca n't do it while you 're here . You 'll have to go out . - I 'll go to the bathroom , then . - All right . - Vic ? - Yeah ? Give me time , wo n't you ? Yeah . I love you , Ingrid . Did you get anything ... you know ? No , I could n't . We 'd better not go too far , then . No . Do you love me , Vic ? Yes . - Do you ? - Yes . You meant all those things you said , did n't you ? Well , I must have done or I would n't have said them , would I ? You did n't say them just for what you could get ? No , love , I would n't do that . But
zone1	. Better get dressed . Phew . It 's hot in here . What 's up with you ? I do n't think it 's hot at all . You do n't fancy going out for a drop of fresh air or summat , do you ? No , I do n't . I do n't fancy any fresh air . I said I 'm cold . Do you fancy a drink , then ? Rum and pep ? Do n't drink . Well , I could warm you up . It 'd take a man , not his shirt button . Enjoying yourselves ? That 's right , yes . Enjoying yourselves ? Jolly good . Oh , you know my wife , do n't you ? - How do you do ? - How do you do ? Look out , here he comes . Watch it . Well , lads , having a ball , eh ? Marjory , my dear , these are some of the reprobates I have to contend with . May I introduce my wife Marjory ? Mr Shaw . Mr Rawly .
zone1	Mr Duggins . - How do you do ? - Yes , well . Be seeing you later , then . Fancy waking up and finding her in bed . Hey ! What you doing ? Kidnapping ? Get away ! It 's my little Adam Faith , this is . Now , then , you draughtsmen , no slacking . I want those blueprints out by 12 o'clock . Aye , it 's all right for some . Do what I did , kid . Get out of it . I thought he was supposed to have left . - Jealous , are we ? - What 's up with you ? I do n't go out with her now . I 'm beginning to wish I did tonight , though . She 's looking all right . Do you know , it 's a funny thing ? Sometimes I really fancy her . The next day , I can hardly stand the sight of her . Ladies and gentlemen . There will now be a short pause for refreshments . Hey , that little blonde . She 's
zone1	by your beds . Return of the bad penny . Well , it 's just nice to see what I 've got out of . When you get to my age , you want security and a pension , eh , Vic ? - I 'm going off security a bit . - There you are , another convert . Well , I mean , you can have a bit too much security , ca n't you ? I 'd like to get out of this town , go somewhere else . Have a look around . Enjoy myself . - Are we all happy ? - No ! And now , as a special treat for you all , the Dawson Whittaker 's Formation Team , who , you 'll all be interested to know , will be going forward to the preliminary round of the Northern Area Formation Dancing Championship . So , we might see them on the telly yet . I 've had enough of this . Who 's for a pint ? Right . Where are we going , then ? Red Lion ? No
zone1	Let 's go to the White Hart . Vic ! - What ? - I 've got to talk to you . - Are you sure ? - Yes . How do you know ? Something that should have happened has n't . How do you mean , it has n't happened ? You know what I mean . - How long ? - 15 days . - Well , that 's nothing , is it ? - It is with me . - But you ca n't be sure . - I am sure , Vic ! - What are we going to do ? - I do n't know . We 'll get married , then , if we have to . I 've always wanted to marry you , Vic . I 've often imagined how you might propose to me and now I 'm forcing you into it . You 'd never have asked for me but for this , would you ? I know you would n't . I 've asked you , have n't I ? I 've said we 'll get married ,
zone1	Vic . You wo n't turn me down , though , will you ? I wo n't . I wo n't . I 've always wanted you . Well , now you 've got me . And your father 's profession ? Engine driver . - And what 's your address ? - 25 Fountain Street . 25 ... Fountain Street . Right . Thank you . Would you take a seat a minute ? The registrar wo n't keep you a moment . Well , it 's a nice day for it . Morning . - Victor Arthur Brown ? - Yes . And Ingrid ... Ingrid Rothwell ? Yes , now , we do have your mother 's consent ... here . Oh , yes . Yes . Mm-hm . Seems to be in order . Please rise . Now , there are one or two things that I do have to tell you . This place has been sanctioned for the solemnisation of matrimony and matrimony should not be entered into lightly . It is a lawful and binding union between one man and one woman ,
zone1	others . Victor Arthur Brown , repeat after me . I do solemnly declare ... - I do solemnly declare ... - ... that I know not ... - ... that I know not ... - ... of any lawful impediment ... - ... of any lawful impediment ... - ... . why I , Victor Arthur Brown why I , Victor Arthur Brown may not be joined in matrimony may not be joined in matrimony to Ingrid Rothwell . ... to Ingrid Rothwell . Now , Ingrid Rothwell , repeat after me . I do solemnly declare ... - ... that I know not ... - ... that I know not ... - ... of any lawful impediment ... - ... of any lawful impediment ... Be sure to write the minute you get there and tell me about the hotel and all that , if you 're comfy . I 'll be all right , Mam . When I think of the nice wedding I wanted her to have , all in white and the church and the choir ... It does n't matter , Mother . It
zone1	. Come on , love , let 's go . Bye , Mam . Ta-ra . Goodbye , love . Look after her , wo n't you ? I will . - Cheerio , Vic . - Cheerio . Come on . - Goodbye , love . - Ta-ra ! - Goodbye , Vic . - Bye , Vic . Bye ! Here ! Do n't forget to write ! Do n't catch cold ! Ta-ta , love ! Our Christine had a white wedding , but it 's all cost . I mean , they 'd do better saving their money . Well , it 's done now . We shall have to see . If her father had been alive , I doubt if there 'd have been a wedding at all . - Bye-bye ! Bye-bye ! - Bye ! Well , missus . Well , mister . - Vic ? - Hm ? Here . Vic . Do you think we should ? Do n't you think it might be dangerous ? - How do you mean , dangerous ? - For the baby . What
zone1	. - Did n't your mother say anything ? - She said I had to be careful . What 's she trying to do ? Spoil our honeymoon ? She was only thinking of me , Vic . She did n't mean any harm . Oh , Christmas ! Now , just you hang on a minute . Now , look . It says you 're OK till about six months . Now , never mind what your mother says . See what that says . - What is it ? - It 's for people getting married . It tells you things , how to go on and all that . I would n't have thought you needed any lessons . Yeah , well , anyway , get reading that . I 'll take your word for it . What have you got this passion-killer on for ? It 's a passion-rouser . It 's sheer nylon . I bought it especially for you . Do n't you like it ? I like it when I 'm looking . - I 'm not looking now . - Oh ,
zone1	, Mam . Come on , Vic . Hello , love . Eeh , it is nice to see you . - Have you enjoyed yourselves ? - Well , sort of . Did you have that terrible storm yesterday ? - Yes . - Ooh , it was shocking here . How many postcards did you send ? I did n't get one on Wednesday . It is nice to get home again . Eeh , everything 's been going wrong while you 've been away . The new carpet has n't come . They promised me faithfully it would be down and fitted by the time you came back , and now they 're saying it 'll be another fortnight . Never mind . And the television 's gone wrong . Well , I 'm saying it 's gone wrong . The BBC 's all right , but there 's a shadow on the commercial . Vic 'll have a look at it , wo n't you , Vic ? Yes , I 'll have a look at it . Oh , well , I should n't touch
zone1	still under guarantee . And anyway , I 've got a man coming to look at it this afternoon . Well , we 'll show Vic where everything is . Get the cases unpacked and then we 'll all have a cup of tea . You know , I 've only had that set three months . I hope that man comes . It 's " Take Your Chance " tonight . - Do you watch it , Vic ? - I think I 've seen it , yes ... There 's a retired major competing at the moment . He 's having to work as a car-park attendant . It 's extraordinary , a man of that background and education . And then there 's some of these people , miners and such like , they 're earning 30 and 40 pounds a week . Yes , well , you just have to take what 's going , do n't you ? Well , here we are . We got the larger bed in . Oh , the new chest of drawers has n't come . There 's somebody
zone1	all looks very nice ... We can put some of Victor 's things in the airing cupboard for the moment . Will you help me take some of those sheets and things out , love ? You see , you ca n't rely on anybody these days . They promise to deliver and then they let you down . Take it or leave it . That 's their motto these days . These people ! Oh , Victor , would you mind not smoking in the bedroom ? Anywhere else in the house , by all means . Oh . Ingrid ? You see those curtains in the bathroom ? Well , you remember Mr Baxter , who used to live next door but one ? He 's got a store on the market now , you know . Has he really ? Yeah , and when I was down there the other afternoon , he said to me , " Mrs Rothwell , you would be a fool to yourself " not to have this four yards , all reduced . " - They look nice , do n't
zone1	thought , " Well , makes a change . " - Mm . Good morning . Small loaf , please . Small loaf . Yes , thank you . Any cakes this morning ? Packet of Eccles cakes , please . Eccles cakes , yes . Any Swiss rolls ? Chocolate ? Assorted ? - Oh , the chocolate , please . - Chocolate , yes . - The children wo n't eat the assorted . - Thank you . Did well last week , then , first team . Yeah , terrific . Micky Patterson 's back on form , i n't he ? He 'll be up against something this afternoon . - Yeah . - Blackburn Rovers . - You 're going down , are you ? - Well , I 'm hoping to . I saw a lovely maternity frock in Lewis 's window . Do you mean that one I told you about ? Yes , I think I 'll go and get it this afternoon . - Yes , love , you go and get it . - I like the blue-and-white one best
zone1	have you ? What 's up ? It 's only quarter past nine . - Good morning , Victor . - Morning . - Behave yourself . - There 's a letter for you . I 'll just go and run over that new carpet , and if that mark has n't come out , it 's going back . And listen , Mr Faddy-Chops , I 've timed these eggs especially for you this morning . Four and a half minutes each so do n't say that 's too hard . Get away . You do n't know how to cook eggs . Hey ! Rub it , man ! Rub it ! Put a bit of elbow grease into it ! And do n't forget the corners ! There and there . Oh , put a bit of life into it , man ! - Who is she talking to ? - The window cleaner , I expect . You do n't talk to people like that . Lazy , idle , slovenly , and then they have the cheek to come round for a Christmas box .
zone1	Hall concert . Shall we go , then ? - Oh , I do n't know . - Why ? What is it ? Brass band concert . My dad 's playing . Only I usually go when I can . Will it be like the last one we went to ? Hm ? What do you mean ? Well , you know . It 's all old-fashioned , i n't it ? Well , you do n't expect them to play the top ten , do you ? No , but I mean it 's more for elderly people . They were all clomping about in big boots when we went . - What 's boots got to do with it ? - Well , you know . My dad 's playing . Look , it wo n't hurt you to go . Crikey , I sat through that picture with you last week . I went to that last one with you , Vic . You do n't expect me to go to every one , do you ? - Look , are we going or are n't
zone1	fortnight tonight . I do n't know . We might want to go somewhere else . You 've got to make sacrifices when you 're married , Victor . Give and take . Yes , well , I do n't see what that 's got to do with it . Well , we 're going anyway . ' Good evening , Mr Frost . You are a commercial traveller , I believe ? - ' And you are from Eltham , right ? ' - ' Enfield , actually . ' ' Enfield ? Oh , you are perfectly right , perfectly right . ' And you are a commercial traveller ' and your hobbies are gardening and looking at people . ' Do tell me , Mr Frost , what exactly do you mean ' by this " looking at people " ? ' - ' Well , I look at them ... ' - You see , it 's not right . The picture should n't keep going bright like that . I thought Mr Mathieson had been round to fix it . I 'm sick of Mr
zone1	shop and if you complain , all he can do is answer back . I 'm not surprised he answers you back , the way you talk to people . It 's the only way to deal with these people , Victor . What do you mean , these people ? What do you keep calling ' em " these people " for ? Just the same as us . They 're just the same as you . - Oh , do n't start , Vic . - You do n't understand , Victor . You do n't see them holding the country to ransom . I mean , take the busmen . 18 or 20 pounds a week they must be getting . You what ? Well , look at the miners and the railwaymen . They want more wages so the fares keep going up and up . They have n't the sense to see that it 's them who 's putting up the cost of living . - They hold the country to ransom . - Do n't talk so damned wet , woman . - Vic
zone1	? Ah , she makes me sick . Got no idea what she 's talking about . I 'm sorry , Mum . I 'll go and talk to him . If you speak to my mother like that again , there 'll be trouble . Well , there 'll be trouble , then , ' cause I 've just about had enough of it . Well , you might show a bit of respect for her . - After all , this is her house . - Oh , do n't I know it ? Do n't put your ash over there . Do n't sit on that cushion . You should n't drop your ash all over the place . Ah , shut up . I do n't know what the hell 's come over you , Ingrid . - You get more like her every day . - Vic ! I tell you straight , I did n't bargain for this bloody lot when I offered to marry you . And there 's no need to swear . She 's enough to make the bloody vicar swear
zone1	the same . You never back me up , do you ? You let her say just what she likes . You never think of siding with me , do you ? I never used to fall out with my mother and I wo n't start now . No , we know . She is my mother , Vic . Yes , and I 'm your husband , if you did but know it . Perhaps you 're sorry you married me . There 's no " perhaps " about it . - See you , Vic . - OK . Of course , with a family , you will be entitled to the allowance . Yes , I have been to the personnel department and I have n't heard anything . You take my advice , you 'll put it to Mr Althorpe . You 'll find him very fair , very fair indeed . - You think so ? - Oh , yes . The management are always willing to listen to the new draughtsmen . Are they ? All right , then ? Come along , Catherine
zone1	Come on . There 's a good girl . Bring your bicycle . I 'm locked out . You do n't know where they 've gone , do you ? They 've gone to the hospital . It 's not antenatal day . But surely ... It 's Ingrid . Yeah ? They 've taken her to the hospital . She 's had an accident . - But surely someone 's told you ? - What accident ? But did n't her mother ring you up ? It was just after two o'clock , love . She fell down the stairs . Come on , Catherine . There 's a good girl . He did n't know anything about it . Hey , stop ! Can you give me a lift to the hospital ? Yes , yes , hop in . Thanks very much . I wish she 'd never set eyes on you . Keep her in for another week or two under our observation ... - ... and then if she does n't get on ... - Can I help you ? Yes , my name is
zone1	Brown . Oh , yes , I want to speak to you , Mr Brown . I 'll see you later , Nurse . I 'm Dr Parker . I 've just left your wife . How is she ? She 's not had a very comfortable afternoon , I 'm afraid . She 's lost a lot of blood . We had to give her a transfusion . But she 's going to be all right . I 'm sorry about the baby . I 'm afraid we could n't do anything to save it . - Can I see her ? - I 'd rather you did n't tonight . Her mother 's just left . I 'm afraid she was n't very good for her . She 's trying to get some sleep now . I ca n't understand why you did n't come earlier . I was at work . I did n't know . Did n't your wife 's mother telephone you ? I 'd be the last person she 'd think of telling . Well , you can visit tomorrow evening at seven .
zone1	? Just tell her not to worry . I mean about the kid . I could n't get used to the idea of being a father , anyway . It 's ten past seven , you know . We 'd better be going , if we 're going . Oh , I do n't mind if we miss the news . - I like your slip . - Do you like it ? It 's nice to get something to fit me again . I thought we were in a hurry . - Mind my dress , Vic . - Oh , bloody hell . How long is this going on , then ? Do n't mind me , will you ? I 've got no feelings . Oh , Vic . You 'll have to snap out of it some time . - What do you mean ? - Well , what I say . You ca n't act up on the strength of your miscarriage forever . I 'm not just putting on an act , Vic . Well , maybe you do n't know it , but

Well , damn it all , it 's about time I could make a pass at you without feeling like a dirty old man . If that 's all you think of , you 'll just have to show a bit of willpower , wo n't you ? It 's been three months , Ingrid . I 've waited for three months . - Very noble and kind . - And what does that mean ? I do n't have to thank you for doing what any normal husband would do , do I ? Well , no , you do n't . But it seems I 've got to go down on my bended knees to get you to do what any normal wife would do . Oh , where 's your self-control , Vic ? Oh , do n't give me that again . I do n't understand you , Ingrid

I do n't just intend to be the lodger . - Are you there , Ingrid ? - Where the hell does she think you are ? - Hello . - Evening , Victor . Hello , love . Eeh , the time I 've been , getting home . The people waiting for buses . Well , I thought you 'd have gone out and I 've have missed you . You going to try your coat now , love ? Coat ? What coat ? You 've got ten bloody coats . What are you always making her buy coats for ? They 've altered the buttons and they 've shortened it a bit . We 're supposed to be saving up to get out of this bloody hole , not buying coats every ten minutes ! Try it on , love . More of an emerald green in this light , is n't it ? It is , really . -
zone1	lovely lining too . I 've always wanted a coat ... Put it away , you mucky devil . You 'll get me shot . Stick us a gill in there . - Where did you get that from , then ? - Friend of mine at the seaside . Thanks . Oi ! Which one have I got to press to get my money back ? Do you mind ? Yes , love ? Just a minute , love . - Half a bitter . - Get nothing there , old son . Where did you spring from ? Just back in my old haunts for a few days . - What are you drinking ? - Half a bitter for me . Two half bitters , please . How are you , then ? Still pushing the old pencil ? That 's about it . Hey , what about you ? I 'm in business now , old son . They 're trying to make a salesman out of me . Get around a bit . Bags of expenses . Just up my line . - You ,

Well , they 've got good reason to , I tell you . You want to try it some time . Try it ? I 've been trying it for two years . Finished my sentence and walked out , packed it in . I did n't know you were ever married . I 'm not now , thank God . Course , I got married too young . That was my trouble . Still , you can always get out of it if you do n't leave it too long . It 's the blokes with kids that I feel sorry for . They 're stuck with it . Yeah . Hey , you did n't get hitched to that blonde you were knocking about with down at the works , did you ? Yeah , I did . Ha-ha-ha-ha ! Well , well . Well ,

There she is , then . What do you think of her ? - Where did you knock this off ? - Bought it , sweat of my brow . - How long have you had her ? - About a couple of months . You jammy devil . - Get in then . We have n't got all night . - Right . They close at half past ten , you know . Hey ! I know this one after all . No , this is about the penguin . Well , a fellow went into a garage , you see , so he says to the attendant , " How big 's a penguin ? " The attendant says , " Well , he 's about this big . " He says , " Oh , bloody hell . I

We 'll wait until His Lordship decides when to come home . Home ? Do you call this my home ? I have n't even got a key . You do n't call this my home , do you ? I 'm just a lodger , that 's what I am . When you 've got a home of your own , you can do as you please . But I expect people who stay in my house to accept my standards . Can you see me getting a house ? I ca n't even rent one , let alone buy one . Not the way she spends it , buying coats all the time . Huh ! They do n't call me Rockefeller , you know . I do n't own Dawson Whittaker 's , you know . No , and you do n't own this house and
zone1	, did n't I ? And bloody glad she was to have me . - Must you swear ? - I feel like swearing . I 've felt like swearing ever since tea time . I do n't know how you can come into the house in that condition . - There 's no decency in you . - I had enough decency to marry her . Yes , after you 'd seduced her . Do you think I had to tie her down ? If it had n't have been me , it 'd have been somebody else . How dare you ? How dare you say such filthy disgusting things ? You filthy upstart . You come into the house drunk , filthy drunk . You 're filthy . You talk filth . You are filth . You 're filth ! You filthy pig . You filthy disgusting pig ! - Oh , Mother ! - Do n't cry , love . Do n't , love . Do n't cry , love . Ingrid ? Ingrid ! Ingrid ! - Go away ! - I want Ingrid !

Ingrid is not leaving this room tonight ! Right , you old cow ! You 've done it ! You 've done it now . Hm ? Hello , Vic . Do you want to come in ? - More tea , Vic ? - No , thanks . - Sure ? Christine ? - Mm-mm . Well , I 'd better go and get dressed . You need n't go . You might as well hear it all . No , I have to go anyway . I know you want to talk to Christine . I 've left her . Oh ? What brought this on ? That bloody woman . Everything . - Was it the miscarriage ? - Well , among other things . You know she did n't even phone me when Ingrid fell downstairs ? And she blames me . Well , after that
zone1	I told her . I said , " I may not be good enough for your daughter , " but I was good enough to marry her when she was in trouble . " Well , you got her into trouble , Vic . I know . I wish to God I had n't . Chris , I wish I could have met somebody like you , someone who 'd make me better than I am , not worse . But you did n't only marry her just because of the baby , did you ? Course I did . It does n't happen to everyone , you know , like you and David . I thought it was like that at first ... but it did n't last for very long . Well , I 'll have to be honest with you , Vic . You 've only yourself to blame . If you had n't played about with that girl , you would n't be in this state . Right 's right and wrong 's wrong . You sound like my mother . Well , you 're married
zone1	the fact . Yeah , I 'm married , all right . You all made sure of that . There was n't one of you said , " Do n't do it if you do n't want to . " It was n't a case of wanting to or not wanting to . You made the decision when you did what you did with Ingrid . I do n't know what to say to you . I could always talk to you . You could always understand better than the others . Well , I ca n't just wave my magic wand and make it all come right . You thought you could come and tell me all about it and everything would be fine , just like it was before you were married . That 's it , is n't it ? Well , I 'm sorry , Vic . It ca n't be done . I know . Well ... we can put you up on the couch for a few days , anyhow . - Morning , Mrs Brown . - Morning , Mrs Cole . -
zone1	. Aye , I heard you were skulking about . Well , I do n't want to talk to you till you 're back with that lass . You 've changed sides , have n't you ? Your Ingrid thinks a lot about you . But you 've never cared a tuppenny damn about anybody but yourself since the day you married her . Have you ever thought what it means to a woman to lose a baby ? What 's she got now ? She 's got nothing . So , do n't you come to me for sympathy . Now , lad ... I 've just been down home . Oh , did you see your mother ? I bet she gave you short change , did n't she ? Yeah . Well , what are you gon na do , then , lad ? Ca n't live at our Christine 's forever . I 'll not go back to Windermere Crescent again , I know that . Who says she 'll have you back ? Who , Ingrid ? Probably she wants a divorce . Is n't
zone1	Well , it amounts to this . Do you want to stay married or not ? I do n't want to stay married to her mother . To hell with her mother , Victor . Cut yourself off . Get yourself right away from that woman . - Where can we go ? - Oh , anywhere . Get a flat . Live in a bloody tent if you 've got to . I 'll tell you something , lad . When I was first married , I 'd have lived in yon pig pen over there before I 'd have lived with her mother . It 's not as easy as that . There are n't all that many places about . You know what Ingrid 's like . She wants a semi like her mother 's . She wo n't just live anywhere , you know . She 'll live where she 's bloody put . You 'd look a right clown if she would n't have you back , would n't you ? It 's better than the last place we looked at . Do you think
zone1	the only snag . We could make something of it . Let 's go , Vic . You want to take it , do n't you , Vic ? Beggars ca n't be choosers , can they ? Well , what I mean is ... I mean , you want to take it because it means we can be together . I reckon we ought to give it a fair try , just the two of us . We might be chucking pots at each other inside a couple of months , but at least there 'll be nobody to blame but us . We 've had a rotten six months , have n't we ? Yeah . - Vic ? - Mm ? All that time , you know , when I did n't want you to make love to me ... well , I did want you to , really . But it never seemed right somehow , while we were living at home , while we were living at my mother 's . You know you 're going to have to stand up to her , do
zone1	were up here together . It 's getting a bit cold , though , is n't it ? We never used to worry about that before . Supposing somebody comes ? Well , we 're married , are n't we ?

One just before she left . Blind ? Good heavens ! They expect one blind child to teach another ? How long did she teach there ? She was a pupil . This is her first position ? She was valedictorian . A houseful of grown-ups ca n't cope with Helen . How can a half-blind Yankee schoolgirl manage ? Great improvement . Now we have two of them . - You be quiet . - I was agreeing with you .

Everyone 's been telling me not to say anything . - Viney , look out front for Helen . - She 's out by the pump ! I 'll look . - Miss Sullivan . - Yes , Captain Keller . Is there no key on your side ? If there were a key , I would n't be in here . Helen took it . The only thing on my side is me . Not in the house ten minutes . I do n't see how you managed it .

What are you looking at ? Nothing for you to look at . - Now ... - (

Very good girl . - ( Kate ) What are you saying to her ? - I was just making conversation . Saying it was a sewing card . Does that mean that to her ? Oh , no . She wo n't know what spelling is till she knows what a word is . The Cap'n says it 's like spellin ' to a fence post . Does he , now ? - Is it ? - No . It 's how I watch you talk to the baby . - The baby ? - Any baby . It 's gibberish . Grown-up gibberish . Baby-talk gibberish . Do they understand

Maybe after a million words . Perhaps you 'd like to read Dr Howe on the question of words . I should like also to learn those ... letters , Miss Annie . I 'll teach them to you tomorrow morning . That makes only half a million each . - It 's her bedtime . - Yes . Ow ! I 'm sorry . ( makesgutturalsounds ) Why does she get a reward for stabbing me ? There are so many times she simply can not be compelled . Yes . I 'm the same way myself . Good night . ( James ) Should n't we give the devil his due , Father ? We lost the South two years earlier when he outthought us behind Vicksburg . Outthought is a peculiar word for a butcher . - Harness-maker , was n't he ? -
zone1	numbers . He led them to slaughter like sheep . - But even if he was a butcher ... - And a drunk , half the war . Agreed , Father . If his own people said he was ... What is it you find to admire in such a man , Jimmy ? - The drunkenness or the butchery ? - Neither , Father . Only that he beat us . - He didn't . - Are you saying we won the war , sir ? He did n't beat us at Vicksburg . We lost it by stupidity vergin ' on treason . ( James ) We lost it because Grant was one thing no Yankee general was before ... Drunk ? I doubt it . - Obstinate . - Obstinate ? None of ' em compare with old Stonewall . If he was there we 'd still have Vicksburg . ( James ) The butcher would n't give up . He tried four ways ... ( Captain ) If we 'd had a Southerner in command instead of a half-breed Yankee traitor like Pemberton ... What 's

It 's the only way we get any adult conversation . - I 'll get another plate . - I have one , thank you . Viney ! What Cap'n Keller says is only too true . She 'll persist in this till ... - I have a plate . I intend to keep it . - You see why they took Vicksburg ? A plate is no matter to struggle with a deprived child about . - I 'd sooner have a more heroic issue . - I really must insist ... - She 's hurt herself . - She hasn't . - Will you please let her hands go ? - You do n't know her well enough ... I know a tantrum when I see one and a badly spoiled child . Hear , hear . You 'd have more understanding if you had some pity
zone1	turns on her whims . Is there anything she does n't get ? What I pity is that the sun wo n't rise and set for her , and you 're telling her it will . What good will your pity do when you 're gone ? - Kate , for the love of heaven ... - I do n't think it serves ... Serves you good . It 's less trouble to feel sorry than to teach her anything ... You have n't taught her anything yet . - I 'll begin now if you leave the room . - Leave ? - Everyone , please ! - You are a paid teacher , nothing more . I ca n't unteach her six years of pity if you ca n't stand up to one tantrum . Old Stonewall indeed ! Mrs Keller , you promised me help . Leave me alone with her now . Katie , come outside with me at once ! - Heaven 's sakes ! - Out , please . If it takes all summer , General ! I 've a mind to ship her

Where will you be , Cap'n , while I am making it clear ? At the office . Will you ? I thought what she said was exceptionally intelligent . - I 've been sayin ' it for years . - To his face ? Or will you take it , Jimmy , as a flag ? ( banging ) ( makesgutturalsounds ) ( stampsfeet ) ( yells ) Good girl , Helen . Agh !

Helen did fold her napkin . What is so extraordinary about folding ' a napkin ? Well , it 's more than you did , Cap'n . Katie ... Today she scuttled any chance of gettin ' along with the child . If you can see any point in her staying , it 's more than I can . - What do you wish me to do ? - I want you to give her notice . - I can't . - Then if you wo n't , I must . ( whimpering ) ( CaptainKellershouting ) ( CaptainKellershouting ) Miss Sullivan ? Captain Keller , I thought we
zone1	, come in . Miss Sullivan , I have decided ... I have decided I 'm not satisfied . - In fact , I 'm deeply dissatisfied . - Excuse me . - Is that little house near the bridge used ? - In the hunting ' season . - Mrs Keller ... - If you 'll give me your attention . I 've made allowances because you come from a part of the country where people ... ( clearsthroat ) ... women , I should say , come from , for whom allowances must be made . I have decided nevertheless to ... Miss Sullivan , I find it difficult to talk through those glasses . Why do you wear them ? The sun 's been down for an hour . Any kind of light hurts my eyes . Put them on , Miss Sullivan . I 've decided ... to give you another chance . - To do what ? - To remain in our employ . But on two conditions . I 'm not used to rudeness . There must be a radical change of manner .
zone1	n't it obvious ? And persuade me there 's a hope of your teaching a child who flees from you like the plague to anyone in this house . - There isn't . - What , Miss Annie ? It 's hopeless here . - Do I understand ... - If we agree it 's hopeless ... Miss Annie , I 'm not agreed . She did fold her napkin . She learns . She learns . Do you know she began talking when she was six months old ? She could say water . Well , not really . Wah-wah . Wah-wah . But she meant water . She knew what it meant , and only six months old . I never saw a child so bright or outgoing . It 's still in there somewhere , is n't it ? Miss Annie , put up with her and with us . ( Captain ) Us ? Please . Like the lost lamb in the parable , I love her all the more . Mrs Keller , I do n't think Helen 's worst handicap is deafness or blindness
zone1	. All of you are so sorry for her , you 've kept her like a pet . Why , even a dog you housebreak . It 's useless for me to try to teach her language or anything else here . Miss Annie , before you came we spoke of putting her in an asylum . What kind of asylum ? For mental defectives . I visited there . I ca n't tell you what I saw . People like animals , with rats in the halls and ... What else are we to do if you give up ? Give up ? - You said it was hopeless . - Here . Give up ? Why , I only today saw what has to be done to begin . - I want complete charge of her . - You have that . No . I mean day and night . She has to be dependent on me . - ( Kate ) For what ? - Everything . The food she eats , the clothes she wears , fresh ... air . Yes , the air she breathes
zone1	her out of . The one who lets her have it should be her teacher , not anyone who loves her . - But if she runs from you to us ... - Yes . That 's the point . I 'll have to live with her somewhere else . For how long ? Until she learns to listen to and depend on me . - I 've packed half my things . - Miss Sullivan ... It meets your conditions . It 's the one way I can get back in touch with Helen . And I ca n't be rude to you if you 're not around . What is your intention if I say no ? Pack the other half for home and abandon your charge to ... to ... The asylum ? I grew up in such an asylum . The state almshouse . Rats ? My brother Jimmy and I used to play with the rats because we did n't have toys . Maybe you 'd like to know what Helen will find not on visiting days . One ward was full of the old
zone1	, but there was nowhere to move them . That 's where they put us . There were younger one's - prostitutes mostly , with TB and epileptic fits , and a couple of the kind who keep after other girls , especially young one's . And some insane . Some just had the DT 's . The youngest were in another ward to have babies . They started at 13 , 14 . They 'd leave , but we played with the babies , though a lot had sores from diseases you 're not supposed to talk about . But not many of them lived . The first year we had 80 . 70 died . Jimmy and I played in the dead-house where they kept the bodies . - Oh , my dear ... - No . It made me strong . But I do n't think you need send Helen there . She 's strong enough . Miss Annie . Yes ? Where would you take Helen ? Well ... - Italy ? - What ? Ca n't have everything . How would your little house do
zone1	wo n't recognise it . You can see her every day if she does n't know . Well ? - Is that all ? - That 's all . Why , Cap'n , with your permission ... Percy could sleep there , run errands . We could let Percy sleep there , Cap'n . - And move in some old furniture . - Cap'n , that old bedstead ... I 've not yet consented to Percy , or the house , or the proposal , or to Miss Sullivan staying on . When I ... Very well , I consent to everything . For two weeks . I 'll give you two weeks . It 'll be a miracle if you can get that child to tolerate you . Two weeks . Miss Annie , can you accomplish anything in two weeks ? Anything or not , two weeks and the child comes back to us . Make up your mind , Miss Sullivan . Yes or no ? Two weeks . I 'll get her to tolerate me . Hm ? A . It 's the first of many
zone1	? - No . For all she knows she could be in another town . - That 's her sign for me . - Yes , I know . In two weeks . Miss Annie , please be good to her . These two weeks , try to be very good to her . I will . ( grunts ) No ! ( dollmakessound ) ( Helensobs ) Two weeks . What did I get into now ? ( Helenmoaning ) ( Anniesobbing ) Oh ... oh ... oh ... ( sobbing ) ( childsobbing ) Jimmy ! Yes ? Did you call me ? No . - What are you doing here ? - Taking a turn . Is everything all right ? Just a dream ? How old was he ? The other Jimmy . Helen 's age . How did he die ? He had a tubercular hip . Oh , we were a pair , all right . Me blind and him on a crutch . When did he die ? 11 years ago , this May . You 've had no one to dream about
zone1	n't let go of things easily , do you ? You 'd be quite a handsome girl if it were n't for your eyes . - No one 's told you ? - Everyone . You 'd be quite a gentleman if it was n't for your manners . You would n't say that to me if you did n't have your glasses on . How will you win her hand now , in this place ? Do I know ? I lost my temper and here we are . I 'm counting on her . That little head is dying to know . - Know what ? - Anything . Any and every crumb in God 's creation . I 've got to use that appetite too . - Maybe she 'll teach you . - Of course . That she is n't . That there 's such a thing as dullness of heart , acceptance , and letting go . Sooner or later we all give up , do n't we ? Maybe you all do . It 's my idea of the original sin . - What

How would you like to play a nice game with Helen ? Touch her hand . ( makesgutturalsound ) Let me go ! Let me go ! She try and talk . She gon na hit me . She can talk , if she only knew .

Oh , why should I talk to you ? I 'm teaching a new word to Percy . So you 're jealous , are you ? All right . Good . I 'm finally back to where I can touch you . Touch and go .

She thinks she shouldn't . - This her breakfast ? - Yes . - She would n't eat ? - She 'd love to eat it . Why have n't you given it to her ? I will , when she dresses herself . She 's thinking it over . - You intend to starve her into obeying ' ? - She wo n't starve , she 'll learn .

We are more than satisfied . You taught her things to do , to behave . - So manageable . Cleaner . - Cleaner ? We say cleanliness is next to godliness . Cleanliness is next to nothing . - Give me more time alone with her . - No . What is she spelling ' ? Water ? Teaching a dog to spell ? The dog does n't know what she means any more than she knows what you mean . I think you ask too much of her , and yourself . God may not have meant Helen to have the ... eyes you speak of . I mean her to . What is it to you ? - Half a week . - An agreement is an agreement . Mrs Keller ... I want her back . I 'll send Viney to help you pack . Not until 6

I know without it to do nothing but obey is no gift . Obedience without understanding is a blindness . Is that all I 've wished on her ? - No . - Maybe . I do n't know what else to do .

Well , fitting in the sense that Jacob 's thigh was out of joint , and so is this piggy's . - James , I declare ! - Pickles , Aunt Ev ? I should say so . You know my opinion of your pickles .

Please pass me more of her favourite food . - Take her , Miss Annie . - Thank you . I 'm afraid you 're the difficulty , Miss Annie . I 'll keep her to what she 's learned . You 're quite right .

His home was invaded by hoodlums books and paintings burned on the lawn . Did you recognize any of them , sir ? No . They wore masks like this . I found this button . Yes , sir .

Now , Maribelle , we 're all on the same side . - Are we , Ben ? - Fair , you mean ? Well , your father 's going on the same network . Same time , same freedom of expression .

And you have my personal guarantee that whoever did do it justice will prevail . - Right , sheriff ? - Certainly . What in tarnation are you laughing at ? Nothing , Pa . Nothing at all .

Not so long as you support a gang of juvenile delinquents called Youth Clubs ... - With a free hand to commit mayhem . - Hold it ! Now , maybe you 're right . And maybe , just maybe the Finley Youth Club was mixed up in that shindig . That 's why I 'm gon na publicly disavow , disown and remove my name from the Finley Youth Club . And if my own flesh and blood was one of them hoodlums he 's gon na pay , even though it brings shame on the memory of his dead mother . God rest her soul . They say I stole the oil rights

But working in a cocktail bar . Of course , I do n't blame you . It
zone1	no elbow room for a go-getter . No opportunity for a man who 's going places . Yeah , but Mr . Barnaby , you know , sporting goods ? He promised me this job as a salesman in promotional sales . Small potatoes . Let me tell you something , laddie . This here is America . Today you 're nobody tomorrow you 're somebody . But you got to think big , act big , and you 'll be big . Now , I could set you up myself , but ... No , sir . I would n't want that . That 's the way . You 're my kind of man , laddie . In this world , there 's only one payoff window . Number one , the winner , success . Now , that can be you . But a man who 's going places he needs a place where he can climb , bust out . A place like New York . Now , this here is the ticket that 'll get you there . Train leaves at 9:40 tonight . This night
zone1	laddie that you come back to St . Cloud number one , riding high on the hog . Well , laddie . But Heavenly , does she know ? She told me to wish you luck and Godspeed . Well , I know , but I wan na talk to her , sir . We made a lot of plans . I plumb forgot . Heavenly and Aunt Nonnie left for New Orleans this morning taking a boat for Europe . Do n't you go forgetting her , now . You keep in touch , laddie , you hear ? Mr . Wayne . Mr . Wayne ! Long distance , Mr . Wayne . They ca n't find Walter Winchell . This is some secretary named Friday . Hello ? Yeah . Well , this is ... Well , when will Mr . Winchell be in ? No . Well , I 'm calling for Alexandra Del Lago , who 's ... Disappeared ? Oh , no , ma'am . She ... She has been searching America for new faces and she has found them , and she has

Well , the princess is unable to come to the phone right now . She 's out . No , out for a walk . Well , sure . Call any time tomorrow . Thank you . Operator ? Say , would you try the Finley residence again ? Good night , mayor . Good night , Mrs . Norris . Bye , mayor . I 'll get it , Charles . Hello . Well , who 's calling ? Now , listen to me , you lousy son of a ... Boy , you just got a natural talent for being mean and ornery . You want me to like this yellow-bellied ... ? I 'd be grateful if you 'd think for once . What 's to think about ? George told me lover-boy came back ... You already told me what George said . But supposing Mr . Wayne did n't just
zone1	. To smear his stink over Heavenly and over me . Is n't that a reason to go and ... ? But supposing he is just passing through . - Well , which is it ? - That 's what you 're gon na go find out . - Charles . - Yes , sir ? - Where 's Heavenly ? - She 's down at the beach , sir . Lay out a suit and shirt . I 'm going into town tonight . - Yes , sir . - Pa . Get the lead out , boy . Pa , you did n't mean what you said about disowning the Finley Youth Clubs ? After what you did to the professor ? I 've got to . Burning books , Halloween masks . You 're just plain stupid , boy . Least you could 've worn white hoods and burned a cross . - The Klan would 've been blamed . - Oh , my . You better stop laughing at nothing or you 'll end up in a nuthouse . Without me you would n't have won
zone1	one . - Bull . - I got you more headlines than the last campaign ... - You sure did . Once for drunk driving and once for a stag party cost me $5000 to hush it up . Nonnie . Hey , you . Yeah , you . What 's Heavenly doing down on the beach alone ? Just trying to be alone , I guess . Sure you ai n't arranged a meeting between her and Mr . Wayne ? - No , Tom . - But you did tell her he was back . - Yes , Tom . - Sister-in-law you got a powerful lot to answer for . You favored Chance Wayne encouraged , aided and abetted in his corruption of my baby . That boy never could ... Could never knowingly harm her . You 're like your dead sister . Gullible . Hello , honey . I do n't like you out here all alone . Why , Papa ? Afraid he might come along ? - Who might come along ? - Oh , Papa . - I 'm concerned , that
zone1	touching , Papa . I 'm only trying to save my baby from being hurt ever again . How ? By insisting I marry Dr . George Scudder ? And before him , a 50-year-old moneybags you needed for your business ? Me ? Sell my own flesh and blood ? More than once . Remember the Texas oil tycoon ? And the Washington wheel ? All of them rich , all of them important . Every one of them had a powerful feeling for you . There was a time when you could 've saved me , Papa by letting me marry Chance , when we were both young and clean . If he loved you so much , why 'd he run off in the first place ? You told him he was n't good enough . You drove him away to compete with all those big shots . - The point is , he went . - Yes , and he tried . Oh , how he tried . And when the right doors would n't open he went in the wrong one's . Oh , do
zone1	me . Not when I need you . For what , Papa ? What are you planning to use me for now ? Why , honey , ever since your angel mama was took away from me you and your brother are all I got in the world to give my love to . - That does n't speak well for Miss Lucy . - Who is Miss Lucy ? That certainly does n't speak well for her . I ai n't never heard of no Miss Lucy . You never heard of the woman you keep in a $50-a-day suite of rooms at the Regal Palms Hotel ? That charges her clothes and beauty treatments to your account ? And you say , " Who is Miss Lucy ? " Well , keep your love , Papa . Just give me 10 percent of the fortune you spend on this woman you never heard of . - You keep your mouth shut . - You better tell that to Miss Lucy . - You keep your mouth shut . She does n't speak very well of you , Papa
zone1	lover . - Who says Miss Lucy says that ? She wrote it with lipstick in the ladies ' room at the hotel bar . Wrote what ? She wrote , " Boss Finley ca n't cut the mustard . " That is a ridiculous lie . Oh , Papa . I know and everyone knows that Miss Lucy was your mistress long before Mama died . I never harmed your mother , as God is my judge . Careful , Papa . Judgment Day might be any day . You listen to me , you ungrateful , hypocritical slut . Last week , in the state capital , when I was speaking on the menace to the chastity of womanhood , a heckler almost caused a riot . You know what he hollered ? " Hey , Boss Finley , how about your daughter ? How about her chastity ? " An honest question , Papa . What was your honest answer ? That was my answer . You have got an illusion of power , Boss . I have power , and that is no illusion . You
zone1	life . I wo n't embarrass you any more , Papa . - I 'll go away . Tonight , if you like . - You 're going nowhere . - You 're marrying George Scudder . - No , Papa , I 'm not . - We 'll discuss it tomorrow . - No . - All right . - Not tomorrow , not ever . All right . Tomorrow night , you 're coming to the TV rally with me , missy . You 're gon na wear the white of a virgin . You 're gon na wear a smile on your face . You 're gon na face that crowd and TV audience with pride and defiance . - That 's gon na stop all those ugly rumors . - I wo n't do it . Then you wo n't . And I 'm gon na remove Chance Wayne from your life finally and for the last time . Now , sugar , how do you want him to leave St . Cloud ? In that fishtail Cadillac he come in , or in the garbage
zone1	choice is yours . Sergeant , get my car out . Did you have another attack , princess ? What was that strange noise ? - Oh , you mean the radio ? - Yes , it frightened me . Well , some more oxygen ? No . No , I must look hideous in it . No , honey . You just ... You just look exotic . Yeah , like a princess from Mars , or a big , magnified insect . Oh , thank you very much . - Well , maybe I ought to call a doctor ? - No . No , no doctors . Get me my robe . When something disturbs me , I just get a little short-winded , that 's all . What is this place ? A private hospital ? And you . What are you ? Are you one of those male nurses ? I take care of you , but I 'm not your nurse . But you 're employed by me , is that it ? For some purpose or other ? - Yep , you 're
zone1	you , princess ? - Yes , I see . I 'm used to footing the bills . Hey . Is your money there ? The jewels accounted for ? I 'm looking for a pill . May I have something to wash it down with ? You 're not going to give me water . Hello ? Oh , yes , Mr . Hatcher . I 'm afraid I made a mistake , Mr . Wayne . Those rooms you 're in , they 're reserved for the TV rally . Well , I 'm sorry too , Mr . Hatcher . You see , Miss Alexandra Del Lago ... - Do n't use my name . ... is sound asleep . - But Miss Del Lago is in no con ... - Do n't use my name . Ask him how long he intends to stay . - Well , that depends . - Hang up . Well , Mr . Hatcher , you would n't wan na bear the responsibility for what might happen to Miss Del Lago if she is ... I said , hang up
zone1	, I only used your name to stop them from evicting us . Will you please shut up ? I 'm trying to forget . Forgetting . What are you trying to forget , princess ? What 're you trying to hide ? You 're all out of focus . Do n't I have any glasses ? Where are my glasses ? Well , you had a little accident . - Oh , what was that ? - You fell flat on your face with them on . - Where 'd you put them ? - lf I was in that condition I would n't know where anything I had with me was . Or anything I did . By the way , did we do anything ? Mostly you 've been knocking yourself out with one thing or another . Did we spend the night together ? Oh , yes , ma'am . But I did not molest you . Well , should I thank you for that or accuse you of cheating ? I like you . You are a nice monster . Well , I was born
zone1	I do n't mind waking up in an intimate situation with someone but I do like to see who it is . So I can make whatever adjustment seems called for . Well . I may have done better but God knows I have done worse . Do you remember where we met ? Well , this much I do remember : That I like bodies to be silky-smooth , hard gold . - Do you remember where we met ? - No . - And the circumstances ? - No . All I remember is us driving through a town called Tallahassee . - And before that ? - That water . Is that the Pacific Ocean ? No , ma'am , that 's the gulf . What gulf ? The gulf of misunderstanding between you and me . - It 's not that funny . - Oh , yes , it is . That 's exactly what Bennie Taubman said to me . " Sweetie , sweetie , " he said ... - No more gulfs between you and I . - Bennie . This comeback will be
zone1	. - I 'm worried , Bennie . You leave the worrying to me . Excuse us for a minute . You 've been a top star for 15 years . You 've got millions of fans . Loyal , devoted . Devoted to the way I used to be , the way I used to look . Bennie , I am scared . - You ? Never . - Miss Del Lago ! You 're a professional , an artist , a personality . Alexandra Del Lago is the sex symbol of America . - Say , Charlie , how about it ? - She 's coming . - Thank you . - Playback . Get me a little something , will you ? - God , no . - What 's the matter ? I remembered the thing I wanted to forget . The stupid , senseless end of my life , that 's all . No wonder I did n't want to remember . I was no fool . - You want some oxygen ? - No . Where is it ? Where is the stuff ?
zone1	it now . Those pills are n't any good . It 's right here . Well , that is a brilliant place to put it . Hotel maid sometimes do clean under mattresses , you know . Would n't that be pretty ? A year in one of those model prisons for distinguished addicts . This is pretty high-class pot . Where 'd you get it ? You beautiful , stupid young man . That is not pot . It 's hashish . Moroccan , and the finest . Pop star . It 's insanity . The legend of Alexandra Del Lago was ... Was youth . I was right . I told him I was right . Why ... ? Why did n't I trust my instincts ? They 've stood me in good stead for many , many a year . Where does one retire to ? There is no place to retire to when you retire from the movies . No place except oblivion . One thing that 'll help you forget oblivion is ... This . It 's this . If I had just been old
zone1	. I just was n't young . Not young . I just was n't young anymore . Nobody 's young anymore . Stars in retirement sometimes give acting lessons . They give beauty hints , they write gossip columns . Princess , just smoke . Oh , yes . Smoke . And after this the mercenary young lovers . - Like me ? - Yes , like you . Your comeback . I mean , what happened ? You just did n't have it anymore ? Oh , I had it . I had the will and I had the talent to go with it . But the camera . The camera does n't know how to lie . The screen is a very clear mirror . There is a thing , God help us , called a close-up . Camera number one in position . Finish your candles , there , boys . Playback . The camera dollies in . And you , your head , your face are caught in the frame with the lights blazing . And all your terrible history screams while you smile . No
zone1	hold it . I told you I want a shadow right here on her neck . You understand ? Not your fault , sweetie . You 're terrific . Okay , Charlie . We go again . Right now . - Camera , number one position . - Playback . - Quiet . - All right , places , everybody . And then , before you know it , comes the night of the preview . The first part of the film , I felt so safe . - What did you say her name was ? - Alexandra Del Lago , stupe . I thought she was dead and buried . Sweetie , wait . Believe me . Please . Miss Del Lago , one more picture , please . She fell . Oh , poor thing . - She 's drunk . - They 're all drunks , all of them . After that , flight . Running away from that frightful comeback . I never stopped running until now . - Know what you need right now ? - Yes , to forget again . First we
zone1	we apply the magic formula . What ? Like we did in Palm Beach , remember ? That soothing , magical formula called papaya cream . Yes . Yes . Papaya-cream rubs . Were you one of those faceless young bodies in Palm Beach ? Well , that 's where we met . Do n't you remember , in your private cabana , on the beach ? And you were breathless . I mean , just like you are right now . It was painful . Painful to see . And you were the anesthetic that eased my pain . Yeah , and you were smoking . Just like you are right now . That feels so ... I do n't remember your face , but your hands are familiar . There . That hash , how 'd you get hooked ? On my way to Europe , running away from my comeback . The ship 's doctor gave me injections . Did he know he was giving narcotics to the famous Alexandra Del Lago ? He just knew he was helping a woman suffering from neuritis . The hashish
zone1	it into the States , smuggle it ? Know another way ? You mean you smuggled it right past customs , princess ? What are you trying to prove ? Nothing . No , I just ... Do n't forget , you 're the one that introduced me to this fine old Moroccan hash . Boy , I doubt very much if I have any vice old or new , that I could introduce to you . - Ma'am , do n't call me boy . - You knew all about this stuff , Carl . - My name is not Carl , it 's Chance . - You called yourself Carl in Palm Beach . I always carry an extra name in my pocket . Why , are you a criminal ? No , ma'am , not me . I mean , you 're the one that 's committed a federal crime . What 'd you do that for ? I thought you might 've planted someone outside the door . Do n't you trust me ? Who taught you to rub desperate ladies the right way ? And
zone1	? - Well , more or less . - How much more ? Ma'am , if we 'd made love , you 'd have remembered it . Well , what stopped you ? Certainly not I . And certainly not your ethics . What 's the angle ? Why did you hold out ? I held out till you signed a contract . Well , evidently I signed . Why did you still hold out ? - I wanted to hold your interest . - Well , you miscalculated . My interest always increases with satisfaction . You mean you do n't intend to live up to that contract ? I can get out of that contract any time I want to . - Do you have any talent ? - For what ? Acting , baby . Acting . A contract for acting implies that you are an actor . Are you ? I 've been an extra in movies long enough to know that I can be as big a star as some of them she-men that have made it . Princess . Princess ? All I need
zone1	takes more than one break . - Chance . Chance . Chance Wayne . - You 're stoned . - Baby , there is no easy way to the top . You can forget about magic formulas and trick contracts . Forget about this false dream . Okay , say it , princess . What is it you want ? Come here . Let 's comfort each other a little . That 's right . Princess ? You know something , honey ? That all that talk about narcotics it 's been recorded on tape . - Where did you get that thing ? - You bought it for me in Palm Beach . To improve my diction . - comeback . The ship ' s doctor gave me injections . Did he know he was giving narcotics to the famous Alexandra Del Lago ? He just knew he was helping a woman suffering from neuritis . The hashish came later . In Tangier . - Blackmail , is it ? - That 's very ugly language . The language of the gutter is understood by anyone who ever fell
zone1	live up to this contract . - And that 's not all . - Money ? - And if I refuse ? - Well , you wo n't . You would n't want the FBI to get ahold of these recordings . - Chance . - Or the newspapers and those bigshot columnists ? And the dirt magazines ? Princess , you got a big name to protect . You still got a reputation . I had , baby , I had . I have been blackmailed by experts . I hate to think what desperation has made you think that you can try to intimidate me . Me , Alexandra Del Lago , with this ridiculous ... Oh , Chance , it 's silly . It 's so silly , it 's touching . It 's downright endearing . Makes me feel close to you . Now , I got ta see somebody . I want some cash and I want your car . Here . Here . Now , you 'd better start signing these traveler 's checks , or I 'll ... Or what ? Oh ,
zone1	When monster meets monster , one monster has to give way and it will never be me . Now , then , signed checks are payment . Delivery comes first . I have only one way to forget the things that I do n't want to remember and that way is through making love . It 's the only dependable distraction , and I need that distraction right now . In the morning , we 'll talk about what you want and what you need . Are n't you ashamed a little ? Yes . Are n't you ? More than a little . Close the curtains , please . Then come here to me . And make me almost believe that we are a pair of young lovers without any shame . Two things , Pa . First , he 's bedding in with a broken-down old movie star , Alexandra Del Lago . But she 's still famous and capable of causing us trouble ... Second , Mr . Wayne do n't show any inclination to move on . I told him she 's not well enough to
zone1	, every newspaper 's gon na be down here . But if we separate Mr . Wayne from his lady we could proceed more directly , if it was necessary . Right , sir . You 're the doctor , call an ambulance . - Haul queenie to the hospital . - Without her permission ? Say she 's contagious . Bubonic plague , typhoid fever . - I 'm not gon na let you involve me in this . - Lower your voice . - He 's not gon na involve me in this ... - Doctor , laddie you are already involved right up to your scrofulous chicken neck . I 've done anything you ever asked me . Anything . But one public mistake , one slip , and we ... Laddie , you 've got all the symptoms of a nervous breakdown . Now , my prescription for you is a weekend vacation . A change of scenery to build up your backbone . I 'd say you 're sickly . Critical . Might be even terminal . So you 'd better leave quick . Tonight
zone1	. - Yes , sir . - Happy Easter , Fly . - Thank you , sir . - Happy Easter . - Thank you , governor . - Shall I ring her , say you 're coming up ? - No . Lucy ? Lucy ? Hiya , honey . I 'll be with you in a second . How can you watch two TVs , chop your toenails stuff yourself with chocolates all at the same time ? I already seen the movie . Shut that damn thing off . I said , shut it ... ! My , my , my . Ai n't we in a mood . Guess what I got for you , for an Easter present . I went all the way to New Orleans for it . Close your eyes , lover . This is a mighty exciting surprise . Do n't look . Like ? Is that for me ? Well , I surely do n't intend to give it to anybody else . Oh , feast your tired old eyes , daddy doll . I sure do hope that this
zone1	sugar . For me ? You 'll spoil me yet , honey . Oh , why , it 's lovely . It 's a lovely Easter egg . Am I supposed to eat it ? Open the top . It sure takes a powerful kind of rooster to lay this kind of egg . Oh , darling , you should n't have . Why not ? You deserve everything you get . Oh , I 'm so nervous . Like it , sugar baby ? It 's absolutely divine . It 's heavenly . That 's better . Now you go downstairs to the ladies ' room of the cocktail lounge and you write on the toilet mirror with this same lipstick : " Miss Lucy is available to any punk 's got $5 and can cut the mustard . " You know , I do n't very much like my Easter surprise . Hello ? Operator , did you get the Finley residence yet ? Aunt Nonnie ? Well , can you talk now ? Well , can I see you , then ? Well , I can ...
zone1	I 'll meet you there . Aunt Nonnie , whatever it is that happened , I can explain . And listen I got it made . No , I really got it made . All right . Princess ? Princess ? Pure , hard gold , all right . Yeah . Well , I 'm glad you 're appreciative but , you know , I 'm going out pretty soon and my credit is kind of shaky . I would like to smoke , please . No , no . Just one of the ordinary cigarettes that only give you cancer . What are those lovely bells ? Why , madam , it is Easter Sunday . How fitting . I feel absolutely reborn . Yes . The world and I are on very good terms this morning . Yeah , well , we made a little bargain last night , remember ? Oh , yes . Well , I will live up to my end of the bargain after I have put on my face . The face I face the world with , baby . Will you open
zone1	're afraid of ? Oh , no , ma'am . The thing I want most in the world is out there . This town belonged to me once . And will again . Were you born here ? - On the wrong side of the tracks , but ... - Well , most of us were , baby . You know , the set that I ran with was a snob set . You know , they had family , big names , big money . - All I had was ... - Beauty . Say it . What you had was beauty . I had it , and I say it with pride . Yeah . Well , the others were born satisfied . Well , I had to get something better . And I did . I got it . While my friends were doing the conventional things like flunking out of state university I appeared in the biggest stage hit on Broadway . I had my picture on the cover of LIFE magazine . And , at the same time I was employing my other talent ,
zone1	ever truly meant for . I 've wallowed in a social register of New York with discreet wives in the millionaire set and debutante daughters in the horsy set . Did they foot the bills too ? Yeah . But I always gave them much more than I took . To older women , I gave back a feeling of excitement and youth . To sad , lost women a merciful display of affection and temporary hope . Eccentrics ? Understanding , tolerance . You must have been quite a successful enterprise . - Oh , I was going places . - Where ? Successville . My name was appearing in columns I was promised this part in a big Broadway play Hollywood was nibbling . I was getting to be somebody . Then it was time for me to come home for my girl take her away with me , like I promised . And when I came home , oh , man . This town just buzzed with excitement . Chance . She never asked about the others . Well , she didn ' t have to .
zone1	was done to could ever cancel out our love , the pleasure we gave each other . You know , the big difference between people is not between rich and poor or good and evil . The biggest of all differences between people is between those that have had pleasure in love and those that have n't . We interrupt this program to bring you a bulletin from Washington . It was officially announced that United States ground forces entered the Korean War today . President Truman termed the intervention a police action . And I am positive there 's no finer , no braver , no more patriotic man to lead our Dixie Regiment than our own hometown boy Chance Wayne . Congratulations . All I could think was , " This stops everything . " Just when things were going great the end . Period . Even if I was lucky , I 'd have to start all over again . You and a few million others . Their jobs would be waiting for them , but my trade was youth . And war either makes you age
zone1	full of hopes and dreams and ambitions being wiped out by a 2-ounce accident like a bullet . A bullet shot off into space by anybody . And my head and that bullet at the same place at the same time . Only , it was n't a bullet that got me , it was my nerves . A month in a hospital , a medical discharge . And when I came home that time , there was no parties , no banners no picture in the newspaper . - So you ran away again . - Yeah . And I finally made it to Hollywood . And failed again . That time . But not this time . Princess . Now , I 've got a few things to iron out right now . But tonight you give this big press conference , see ? You know , to tell the world about this new discovery you signed up . The last thing I want is publicity . I know , but this will prove that young talent is your real interest in life . Which it certainly is
zone1	life is me , Alexandra Del Lago . Besides , a movie starring our special talent would be banned in all 50 states , censored worldwide . Princess , I am taking your car . - Well , when will I see you ? - Wait here . I do n't like waiting for anybody . Baby . Morning , Miss Finley . What is it , sergeant ? Nothing , miss . Just sort of spying ? No , ma'am . Just sort of watching over you . Easter must be a very dangerous time . Guess so , miss . - The ladies ready for church ? - Miss Nonnie 's already gone , sir . - She took a taxi . - I see . - She get any calls this morning ? - The phone rang . She talked to somebody . No , sir , Mr . Finley . I do n't know who to . Get my Bible . Good morning . Nice morning , Mr . Finley . Thank you , laddie . You look mighty sweet , sugar . I would like
zone1	would like you to behave like a daughter should . Well , did you meditate on Mr . Wayne 's future ? At the present , he is enjoying life in the loving arms of a famous Hollywood siren . Hey , Pa , if Chance is living with a real princess does that make him royalty too ? It makes him what he always was : A criminal degenerate and parasite . Oh , I see . Chance ? She never blamed you for anything . She always had ... Nothing . I gave her nothing , Aunt Nonnie . She lived lonely and she died lonely . Gee , I 'm glad to see you . I came here to tell you one thing . Well , I was sort of hoping that you 'd bring Heavenly . Go away before it 's too late . Before her father ... Why wo n't they let me see her , Aunt Nonnie ? Because she and George ... ? - I ca n't talk about it . - Why ? Why ? Now , why , Aunt Nonnie ?
zone1	Please help me , Aunt Nonnie . You were always able to ... See , you were like a mother to me . You always called me son . Why did you stop calling me son ? Oh , Chance , go away before it 's too late . I am not leaving here till I talk to Heavenly or see her . Now , you tell her that . Aunt Nonnie , I got a right . Goodbye , son . Aunt Nonnie . - Aunt Nonnie , I 'm taking you to church . - No , Chance . I 'm afraid . Afraid for you . Take your sister on in . - Happy Easter . - Happy Easter , mayor . Well , look here . Glad to see you , laddie . Hold it , Mr . Finley . Thank you , sir . It 's no use , Mr . Finley , I ... Laddie , I hear you 're consorting with a genuine princess . Guess that sort of makes you a prince , do n't it ? Happy Easter , Mrs .

That 's Why He Died , And That 's Why I Did n't Go To The Funeral . Why Did He Have To Die ? Why Did He Have To Run Into Me ? That 's A Lot Of Damn Nonsense , Holly . I Knew You 'd Say That . I Could Have Bet You 'd Say That . I 'm Making A Fool Of Myself . Excuse Me . [Doorbell_Rings] Come On In . Morning . Uh , Coffee . Help Yourself . No , Thanks . I Had Mine . How 's The Young Lady

zone1	Closing The Gap . Now He 's Almost Wheel-To-Wheel With Petty . What A Battle . Marsh Has Tried The Inside , Outside In A Desperate Bid .

Beer , Tom . I ... I did my best for him . I 'm sorry . - Was n't good enough , was it

If you let me carry out one post mortem . It 's no good cutting him up after he 's dead . It 's too late . - You 're being ridiculous - Ridiculous is it ? There 's my brother lying dead out there . And twelve others like him . Twelve . How long have you been with us , Doctor ? Twelve months , is n't it ? That 's one a month . - Steady , Tom - One a month . Not a very good record , is it ? Are you trying to say no one died before I came here ? At least we knew what they died from . And if I was to tell you they died from swamp fever or the plague or some other nonsense , would that make you
zone1	. - Well , it would n't be the truth . I 'm not going to start telling a lot of ridiculous lies just to keep you people satisfied . It 's not good enough . Oh , so we are not good enough for you now ? - I did n't say that . - it 's what you meant , though . Well , let me tell you something , Doctor . You 're not good enough for us . Do you understand me ? You 're not good enough ! - Ah , Doctor , there you are . - Sir James ! - Good afternoon , gentlemen . - ( All ) Good afternoon . We 've met before in rather distressing circumstances . May I now introduce myself ? Sir James Forbes , Professor of Medicine at London University . And this young man was my cleverest and most able pupil . I hope you realise how lucky you are to have him here . Landlord , see these gentlemen have a drink with me , will you ? Yes , sir . Thank you
zone1	ready ? - Good afternoon , gentlemen . - ( All ) Good afternoon . - Sir James , what are you doing here ? - You 've lost weight , my boy . - Alice not feeding you properly ? - Yes , but ... - Are n't you glad to see me ? - You 've no idea . - Why have you come ? - You wrote to me . It 's very kind of you to come all this way , sir . I 've just seen Alice . She 's not looking well . Poor Alice . I 'm afraid she needs a holiday badly . - You both do , by the look of you . - Ca n't manage one at the moment , sir . - You 've no idea what it 's been like . - Well , we 'll talk about it later , without any of this hocus pocus you put in your letter . Ah ! That was an excellent meal . You girls are to be congratulated , eh , Peter ? Oh , yes , Sir
zone1	is , cooking is a science and not an art . If you get it right once there 's no earthly reason why you should n't get it right every time . Now , you girls run along to bed . Peter and I will do the dishes - But , Father , you ca n't ... - But Father , nothing . You 've had a long day and I 'm sure Alice is tired . Yes , I am tired , it 's true . Good night , Peter . Father . Good night , my dear . It 's so nice to see you again , Sir James . Thank you , my dear . it 's nice to see you , too . For you , Sir James ? No , thank you . That 's not the answer , you know , Peter . I know . I wish I knew the answer . First of all , we have to decide what the question is , do n't we ? This disease seems to be more mental than physical . Yes , but you
zone1	was no attributable cause for this mental affliction . I 'd like to Know a little more about the symptoms . - What about appetite ? - The patient show a loss of appetite . Skin colour ? In every case a loss of skin colour , too . - Reflexes ? - Retarding Hm , like someone in need of a holiday in fact , eh ? - You do n't mean Alice , surely ? - Now , now , now . Do n't let 's jump to any conclusions . - What did the autopsies show ? - I did n't make any . You did n't make any ? What 's come over you ? It is not permitted to make any . - Well , who stopped you ? - The villagers . They do n't want the bodies of their love one's cut about . What about the coroner ? Surely he supported your applications ? - There is n't one . - No coroner ? This is n't London , sir . This is a Cornish village , inhabited by simple country people
zone1	He acts as coroner and magistrate , judge and jury . And who is this jack of all trades ? Hamilton , sir . Squire Hamilton . Master ? Tonight . Tell the others . They are not back from the chase , Master . Tell them to prepare just as soon as they return . I do hope you meet him , Sylvia . He 's such a charming man . - Is he now ? - And so handsome . - And rich . - And unattached ? Yes . Yes , he is , as a matter of fact . You 're not trying to marry me off by any chance ? Well , you could do a great deal worse . He 's got a lovely house and a lot of money . And what does Peter think ? He does n't like him . He thinks he 's arrogant and overbearing . But he 's wrong . He is wrong . - Good night . - Alice . You 're trying to tell me something else , are n't you ? No ! No ,

Here , you 'd better let me do the drying . - I really do need a drink . - Rubbish . What you need is an end to your worries . So far we 've nothing to start on , nothing to help us at all . I know . We must have a body to examine . We ca n't possibly work without one . If you 're thinking of applying for an exhumation ... Apply for nothing . We 'll dig one up . - We 'll what ? - Dig one up . That lad they buried today will do . Nice and fresh . Then we might learn something . - But we ca n't just go out and start ... - We 'll do it tonight . There 's a full moon . Could n't be better .

I know that it is useless to ask you to forgive my friends . Such behaviour is beneath contempt and beyond forgiveness . I only ask that you accept my solemn word that I knew nothing of what was going on . How do you know my name ? The arrival in as small a village as this of a beautiful young lady and her distinguished father could scarcely go unnoticed , Miss Forbes . My name is Hamilton , Clive Hamilton . Will you kindly take me home , Mr Hamilton ? I fear you have not forgiven me yet . Your fears are well founded , Mr Hamilton . I have not . Now , will you take me home or do I have to walk ? Is there nothing I can do to persuade you of my personal innocence ? Nothing . I
zone1	My carriage is at your disposal . Unfortunately , I ca n't leave at this moment but I shall instruct one of my young guests ... - Thank you . I prefer to walk . - Miss Forbes , you ca n't walk . You might be attacked , Miss Forbes . I 've already been attacked . And it was here in your house . Now , please open the door . Thank you . And tomorrow I shall go straight to the police . - Please do n't do that , Miss Forbes . - Why should n't I ? I am the Squire of this little community and responsible for the welfare of everyone in it . Should any scandal attach to my name , the effect could be disastrous for all these people . I ca n't expect you to understand why that should be . I just ask that you believe it . And what about those your charming young guests ? Will you leave me to punish them in the way I think most fit ? I promise they 'll suffer for what they
zone1	had n't been for you . Yes , that 's true , I suppose . Very well , Mr Hamilton . I wo n't go to the police . - This time . - Thank you . Are you sure you can find the way ? Thank you , Mr Hamilton . Good night . Please take great care not to stray from the path . There are tin mines under this land . The ground sometimes subsides . Denver ! Everything is ready , Master . . Ah . . ( Laughs ) Alice . Alice ! ( Gasps ) Good evening , Officer . You just step up here a moment , gentlemen , please . I ... I realise this looks ... it 's a serious charge you 'll be on in the morning . What charge ? Who might this gentleman be ? Sir James Forbes . - Good evening , sir . - Good evening . What are you going to charge us with ? Body snatching I should think , sir . I see . Well , in that case I suppose ... you
zone1	I do n't care who you are , sir ! Well . What 's going on , sir ? I do n't know , Sergeant , any more than you do . Now , look , Sergeant , I need your help . My help , sir ? Say nothing of what you 've seen here tonight . Now look , Sergeant , it does n't need me to tell you there 's something very wrong in this village . All these young men dying and now this . Well , some people say it is the marsh fever , sir . Oh , marsh fiddlesticks . In any case , it could n't cause a body to disappear into thin air , could it ? - No , sir . - Well , then , will you help me or not ? I 'd like to help you , sir . Really I would . My boy was one of the first to go , sir . Well , then , help me for his sake . Very well , sir . I 'll withhold my report for 48
zone1	Thank you , Sergeant . You wo n't regret it . I 'm sure of that . What are we going to do about this , sir ? We 'll fill it in , make it look as if it 's never been touched . We can manage this on our own , Sir James . Why do n't you wait inside where it 's warm . Thank you , Peter . Yes , I will . - Good night , Sergeant - Good night , sir . Right-ho , let 's get on with it . Sylvia ? Have you seen Alice ? She 's not in her room . Come in , Peter , and sit down . - Sit ? - Please sit down . I have some shocking news for you Peter . - What is it ? - Alice . Then she was ill . - I must go tell her . - Wait . - I have to see her . - She 's not here . - Where is she ? - Control yourself , Peter . She 's not here . Now
zone1	on the moors . She 's dead . No . Sylvia found her . No . ( Sobbing ) No . Oh , God . Forgive me . I killed her . - That 's not true . You know it isn't . - Yes , it 's my fault . - I should have known . - That 's nonsense , Peter . If she 's been struck by this disease , it 's no fault of yours . Take me to her , wherever she is . Yes , I will , Peter . I will . But there 's one thing we have to do . We must find out about the disease , find out what it is and destroy it . You will have to let me perform an autopsy . - God . - We have to , Peter . And I shall need your help . - I 'm ready , Father . - Yes , very well . We 'll ask the sergeant to come with us . - Hey , Martinus . - Heh ? Come on , wake up !
zone1	. ( Screams ) No ! Extraordinary . - No sign of rigor mortis . - Hm . When did she do this ? - Some days ago . - How ? Piece of glass , I think . She was rather secretive about it . - Oh ? - It was a clean wound . ( Sighs ) Well ? It 's not human . - it 's not human blood . - Exactly . She 's been splashed with the blood of some animal . Do you think she might have been attacked ? By an animal ? There are no external signs of violence . None at all . Then how did she die ? That 's what we are trying to find out , Peter . How did she die ? Stop it ! I ca n't stand any more . It 's not a matter of what you can or ca n't stand , my lad . - it 's the truth that matters , the truth . - I 'm telling you the truth . - Look , Jack . - Sergeant . Sergeant
zone1	me so it 's no use my denying it . And she ... And the body was found right by me , all right . But I did n't kill her . I did n't kill her ! So you say , but you was drunk . And so I 'll go on saying , because it 's the truth . All right . What was you doing up there , anyway ? I told you . I 'd just had a skinful . I do n't know why I went up there . Just to get away from everything . Are you sure you did n't see her ? - And follow her into the woods ? - No ! You 'd had a row with her husband . There 's plenty who 'll swear to that . Now , I put it to you that you wanted your revenge . - So you saw her and followed her ... - No , I tell you , no ! - Is that the truth ? - Yeah , it is . I 'm sure of that , at least
zone1	least " ' ? What do you mean by it ? You would n't believe me , anyway . You leave that to me to decide . You saw something else up there , did n't you ? What was it ? What was it ? My brother . - You saw your ... - My brother , yes . The one that 's dead ! The one that 's buried out there . I saw him just as clear as I see you now . All grey , his eyes staring . I saw him . And yet I know he 's out there , lying in his coffin . Nothing . Absolutely nothing . Peter , you 'd better go up and get some rest . You 've been on your feet for 24 hours . I ca n't rest . I 'll just go and make all the arrangements for the funeral . - ( Knockatthedoor ) - Yes ? - Excuse me , sir . - What is it , Sergeant ? The front door was open so I took the liberty ... Well , what
zone1	. - What about him ? You should have a word with him . Oh , very well . I did see him , sir . I swear it . Everything I told the sergeant is the truth . I 'm telling you , sir . I did see him , sir . I saw my brother . Your brother is dead and buried . I know that , sir . Did n't I bury him myself ? But I saw him in his shroud . - Standing , staring at me . - How could you see him ? God only knows , sir . But I saw him . God only knows , indeed . That 's all , Sergeant . You do n't believe me , do you , sir ? On the contrary , I believe everything you say . Well , are you satisfied now , Sergeant ? No . - You just heard the gentleman say ... - I know what the gentleman said . But I 'm the law here . And I 'm responsible for you until I have made further investigations
zone1	Gasps ) Father . Feeling better , my dear ? Feeling well enough to talk ? Now , when you told me about Alice , you said there was a man with her . Did you recognise him ? No . You remember the young man we saw who was following the funeral procession , the one who shouted at us to go away ? Yes . - He 's been arrested . - But it was n't him . But you said you did n't recognise the man . ( Gasps ) Is it possible that the man you saw was the man in the coffin ? It was , was n't it ? But how ? Never mind how , my dear . Just one more question and then you can rest . When we found Alice was she in the same place where you saw her with this man ? No , no she was n't . It was up by some old mine works . I do n't Know exactly where . Well , I 'll try to find them . You go back to sleep
zone1	few minutes . Thank you , Father . Very well . Ah , Peter . - How is she ? - Oh , very much better . She 's talking of getting up . Well , I feel like a stroll . Care to join me ? Yes . I want a word with the sergeant so we 'll call in on the way . Where are we going , sir ? Up on the moors . A breath of air will do us both good . I did n't know this place even existed . What did they mine here ? - Tin , sir . - Tin ? Yes , there 's a rich vein runs under here sir , worth a fortune . Then why has it been allowed to fall into decay like this ? There was a lot of accidents , sir . Miners killed and maimed . They would n't go down there . They said it was unlucky . Old Squire was furious , but he had to shut it down . Has young Hamilton tried to reopen it ? Oh , no
zone1	money . - Where does he get his money from ? - I ca n't rightly say , sir . He was away when his father died in foreign parts . The old squire left him the house and a lot of unpaid bills . When young Squire come back here , he shut himself up there , would n't see nobody . Then suddenly he had a lot of young people down staying there and spending money like water . It 's creepy . - They do say , sir , that it 's ... - What do they say , Sergeant ? - That it 's haunted ? - Well , how did you know that , sir ? It does n't take much guessing , does it ? Come on , Peter , we must n't leave Sylvia alone too long . Thank you , Sergeant . (
zone1	knock_on_door ) - May I come in ? - Please . Thank you . What can I do for you ? At our last meeting you made it abundantly clear that my attentions would not be welcomed , that
zone1	appreciate your feelings and the reason for them . I would n't dream of imposing myself on you , only ... Only I felt I had to come and tell you how terribly sorry I was to hear the news of your friend , Alice Tompson . I knew her , you know , not very well but enough to realise what a very fine lady she was . Please accept my sincere condolences . Thank you , but would they not be better given to her husband ? I fear they would not be accepted , Miss Forbes . - Oh ? - Doctor Tompson does n't like me . You are not alone in your opinion of me . I ca n't imagine that the opinion of others affects you very much . Oh , I should like to be popular , of course . I should be lying if I said otherwise . But I realised long ago that in order to be popular one must conform . I find that too big a price to pay . Conform ? Well , to the standards of conduct
zone1	I conform to them . At least you are honest , Mr Hamilton . Probably my only virtue . ( Laughs ) I 'm always honest , even with myself . I wonder how many people can truthfully admit to that . Not many , I agree . I am becoming a bore . I have taken up enough of your time . Oh , I wonder , could I impose on you for a glass of water ? Oh , yes of course . Unless you prefer sherry ? Please , I do n't want to put you to any trouble . It 's no trouble . Do you believe in life after death , Miss Forbes ? - That 's an odd question . - Odd ? To ask a stranger . I was hoping that you no longer considered me a stranger . Very well . Yes , I do believe in life after death . Do you ? I 'm sure of it , Miss Forbes . - (
zone1	glass_breaks ) - I 'm sorry . - Here , let me ... - Oh ! How
zone1	's nothing , really . This should prevent the risk of any infection . You must think me a clumsy idiot . I really do apologise . One can not be too careful . There . Is that better ? - Thank you . - A safety pin should hold it . I have one in my bag . Allow me . May I say that I consider you to be a very brave young lady . Because of this ? Because of everything , Miss Forbes . I 'll see myself out . ( Drumbeats ) ( Drumbeatsintensify ) it 's the Master . Open .

I am given to understand that you have a fine collection of books on a variety of subjects . I wonder if you have any on witchcraft or black magic . If so , may I have the use of your library ? - Come with me . - Thank you . Come in , sir . No , no , please sit down . Oh , hello , Peter . Peter ... Have you ever heard of voodoo ? - it 's a form of witchcraft , is n't it ? - Exactly . It 's practiced in the Caribbean , in Haiti to be precise . Please sit down , Vicar . I find all kinds of
zone1	You 're not following and there 's no reason why you should if I do n't explain properly . - Unless you would like to ... - No , I 'm ignorant in these matters . Oh , well . Sylvia tells us that she saw something on the moors , something that was a man and yet not a man . Her description was of a walking corpse , the corpse of Martinus ' brother . Now young Martinus also says that he saw something on the moor , something that he insists was his brother . But we know that his brother is dead . We also know that he is not lying in his coffin . Now , what do you make of that ? That he was buried alive , that he somehow freed himself and he 's out there . But I 've told you , Peter , I saw him . And he was as dead then as any corpse I have ever seen . No , that 's not the answer . Then , what is ? What is the connection with voodoo
zone1	corpse wandering on the moors is an undead , a zombie . It 's incredible , sir . How can you , a man of science , believe that ? I have an advantage over you there , Peter . I spent the afternoon reading up the subject in the vicar 's library . And it 's all there . It 's all clearly scientifically stated . And we have the evidence of two sensible human beings . What can be done ? About Martinus ' brother ? Nothing . I 'm thinking of Alice . - Are you saying that Alice is ... ? - Peter , I am . I pray that I 'm wrong . But I 'm going to watch over her grave tonight with the vicar until daybreak . I 'll come , too . I 'd rather you did n't . I think you need some rest . , - I am rested , sir . - Well , I 'm ... If anything were to happen , I 'd rather you were n't there . I 'm coming with you . Very well
zone1	should go home now . it 's very late . Dr Tompson and I will stay on . - If you 're sure . - Yes , yes . Quite sure . All right . - Good night , Sir James . - Good night . ( Drumbeats ) ( Drumbeatsintensify ) What happened ? - Who attacked you ? - I do n't know . He wore a mask . We 'll take you home . ( Drumbeats ) I shall be all right now , thank you . If you should need me ... Do n't worry . We wo n't hesitate to call you . Thank you , Sir James . We must get back . This may have been a trick . ( Footsteps ) Zombie . ( Screams ) - Oh . - Peter ? Peter , it 's all right . it 's all right now . You had a nightmare . A nightmare ? Then , it was n't Alice ? I 'm afraid that part of it was true . You fainted and we brought you back here . And Alice ?
zone1	will be at peace now . Peace ? Is there such a thing ? There will be , my son , and with God 's help and the energy of your good friend , I am sure of it . Well , I must get back to my church now . Thank you for your help , Vicar . It is I who should be thanking you . I shall pray for you both . Would you care to tell me about your dream ? It sometimes helps . I dreamed I saw the dead rise . All the graves in the churchyard opened and the dead came out . All the graves were empty . In heaven 's name , where are they ? What 's happened to them , sir ? It is essential that none of the villagers should know of this . We must get these graves filled in before anyone is astir . Very good , sir . Sergeant , I want another word with your prisoner , young Martinus . - You want to see him right away , sir ? - Yes ,
zone1	can see that . The question is how ? The question is , where did he go ? Has he joined the others ? - The others ? - You know what I mean . But he 's not dead , sir . Not yet , Sergeant . But he soon will be . Did the prisoner have any visitors yesterday ? - Well , did he ? - Er ... No , sir . - Are you sure ? - Yes , sir . Well , only the squire , that is . - What did he want ? - He wanted a word with the prisoner . I did n't think there was anything wrong . - What did they talk about ? - Oh , I did n't listen , sir . I did n't think it would be right . They just talked ? Nothing else ? - No , nothing , sir . - Are you sure ? Well , of course I 'm sure , sir . They just talked . Oh , the Squire asked for a glass of water . For the
zone1	him one . Where is it ? - The water ? - The glass ! I threw it away , sir . It got broken . - Who broke it ? You ? - No , the Squire . And young Martinus out himself ? How did you know that ? Never mind . Sylvia . Sylvia ? - Yes , Father . what's the matter ? - Oh , there you are . Oh , nothing , I ... I was just getting a little worried about you . Why ? I 'm all right now . I 'm just clearing up . - How 's the finger ? - Fine , thank you . Almost healed . I must get on . Ah , Peter . I have to go out again . I want you to do something for me . Do n't let Sylvia out of your sight until I tell you it is safe to do so . - But , sir ... - Please . Believe me when I say she is in danger . (

I 've told you , he is busy . I 'm glad to hear it . I , too , am a busy man . But as I have found the time to come all the way out to see him I think that he could come out to see me . Would you tell him that , please ? Well ? Yes , thank you . - Are you being funny ? - No , I 'm not being funny . I 'm just trying to remember my manners . I wish I could say the same for you .

Am I right in thinking that you have spent a large part of your life in the Caribbean , in Haiti , to be precise ? And while you where there , did you learn something of the practice of voodoo ? You are mad ! No , I 'm not . But can the same be said of you ? Get out of here ! - I 'm not going . - Yes , you are . Good night , Mr Hamilton . Well , I 'm ready . (

You all three stand convicted of a craven and cowardly assault on a defenseless old lady . Because you were told that
zone1	into her flat , expecting to find a considerable sum in jewellery there . Well , your information was incorrect because the old lady was there . And your first act on entering was to order her to take off a valuable diamond ring she was wearing . And when her knuckles proved too swollen for her to remove it , you threatened to rip it off . Having thus reduced her to a state of quivering terror , she was then struck violently across the head and locked unconscious in her bathroom . The effects of that savage blow were such that she is today almost totally blind . You then left the flat , taking with you jewellery to a value of approximately ? 100,000 .

I can just see her now , tottering down the road in a little pink frock with all her bum showing . There you are , Jenny . ( Joy ) You seen this in the paper ? Some fella did a smash and grab . He got away with ? 50,000 worth of jewels . Why do n't you go up west again ? Here , have a look . Some people have got more chance
zone1	you just ca n't do that on your own . He 's not a burglar , the geezer . You need a ringer . You need , like , two-handed , you need a ... Well , you need money . You got ta have money to do something like that . Well , why do n't you ask Jim and Bunter to lend you some ? Jim and Bunter would n't give me anything , Joy . Nobody would give me anything . What have I ever give to anybody ? People , if you 've got no dough , you 're nobody . You 've got no money , people do n't want to know you . - You got money , you 're Jack the lad . - Look at my knees . I paint my toenails then I forget to wash my knees . I du n no know what 's wrong with me . Here , did you hear about that Jimmy Baxter ? He got off . ( Laughs ) Do you know how he got out of that , love ? It cost
zone1	one of the flying squad , ? 200 . - Well , what do you mean ? - He give it to him . He give it to him so as not to give evidence . - Ai n't you ever heard of that , Joy ? - Well , I have , yeah . Do you know last time I got nicked , I sent you round to Lennie to borrow money ? - Yeah . - The money was n't for you , Joy . If Lennie had given me the money , I would never have done that last lot of jail . Well , I did n't know that . You did n't tell me . The only straight policeman you 'll ever see is possibly ... the top man in England or the one's on the zebra crossings . All the other one's , with their Moody Blue raincoats and their tough boots , they 're all bent , love . The lot . From start to bottom . Bent . They 're bent on traffic of fences . You got money , they go
zone1	's like anything . People like stockbrokers and all those people in official positions , or in a position to handle the public 's money , they 're all thieves . All the MPs , everybody . But they make laws so they ca n't get nicked . Not like us . We 're the only people who get nicked when we do anything . Screws are the same as cozzers . If I 'd had a tenner a week to give a screw , I could 've had a bottle of whisky every week . The only thing you ca n't get in there is a broad cos it 's too big . That 's all . Everybody 's bent , Joy . It 's like this flat . We had to give a few quid to get this flat . Plenty of people on the housing list ca n't get a flat cos they 've got no money . Everybody 's bent . - Hello , Mr Jacks . - You 're early . Had a good week , then ? - Yeah . How are you today
zone1	are . - Hello . - Say hello . - Hello . - He likes you . - He liked me last time , did n't he ? Oh , that 's quite good . That 's very good . Do n't you fancy her ? Yeah . They would n't be allowed now to do a picture like that in Germany . - Why 's that ? - Well , they just passed a law , you see . You ca n't ... If you 're gon na expose your breasts in a photograph , you see , you 've either got to see both of them or none of them . - Really ? - Yeah . None of this business . You ca n't have one out and one in . You either have them both out or none . - Why 's that ? - I do n't know . ( MrJacks ) I like the patter . " Man is for woman made and a woman made for man . " - They 're right , ai n't they ? - I bet she 's
zone1	can you tell ? She ... I like her . What do you reckon ? Yeah , she 's quite nice . She 's got a bit too much make-up on for me . I think that 's rather good , you see . Poking them either side of the ... - ( Laughs ) - ... of the wooden doings . - Yeah , I suppose that 's quite artistic . - Yeah . Mmh . I like that , actually . What do you reckon ? Mmh . It 's quite nice . Yeah . How would you like to have a bit of wood , anyway ? ( Laughs ) Oh , I think she 's repulsive . Look at that face . ( MrJacks ) Out the way . Out the way . ( MrJacks ) That 's the one . ( Joy ) Oh , no , she has n't got much . ( Joy ) I mean , I would 've thought you liked them with , erm , you know ... ( MrJacks ) Well , yeah , I do . I know
zone1	MrJacks ) It 's a landmark in the dark . - ( JoyLaughs ) ( Joy ) What do you like about her , then ? ( MrJacks ) Well , she looks in need of it , you see ? Oh ! Oh , you are cheeky , are n't you ? ( Joylaughs ) You know , what I 'd really like is a nice flat in Chelsea . Have you got any ? Have I got any ? Well , I might be able to put you onto one . Ooh , pardon . I might . Yeah , well , it sounds a bit more classy than this . Sounds a bit poxy , a flat in Wandsworth , does n't it ? - Where have you been , Joy ? - I went to pay the rent . - You went to pay the rent ? - That 's what I said . - You 've been four hours paying the rent ! - Do n't do that ! Do n't start all that ! Now , do n't start all that . Has he
zone1	. - Eh ? I have n't seen one . What do you mean , has he got a couch ? You know what I mean ! Where 's my tools ? - I have n't seen your tools ! - I want ' em ! - Now , do n't you start ! Do n't ! - Sit down ! I want my tools ! Do n't start that with me . I 've had just about enough of you . You 're always having a go at me ! I come in this house , I do everything I can . I 'm not your slave ! I 'm not your ... - ( Screams ) - Now get ! Now get down there ! - You gon na get down there ? - Yes , I am ! I am ! Do n't touch me ! - Get down there , then ! - ( Sobs ) - Let me go ! Do n't hit me again , please ! - Let you go ? ( Sobs ) ( Tom ) Look , I 'm sorry ,
zone1	away ! - Do n't go running to your old woman . - Do you know what you 've done ? - What have I done ? - You 've hit me . You 've hit me and ... - Look , I did n't mean to hit you . - You 've hit me and I might be pregnant . - That 's it . That 's the finish . - I told you never to lend ' em , Joy . ( Joy ) ' You see , he wo n't go . He wo n't leave me . ' And I ca n't get rid of him unless he gets nicked . ' If only I had a car , I 'd drive off and find a place ' where there are only men and a few glamour girls ' and flashy cars and big hotels . ' But then I 'd muck myself up talking . ' Cos I always get ballsed up talking to the upper classes . ' Whoever heard of girls like me making it ? ' How can I go back to
zone1	same anymore . ' Oh , I ca n't stick this sort of security . ' I ca n't abear the thought of all these women doing the same things , ' you know , mopping down their steps , doing their ironing , ' changing their babies , doing their shopping . ' Then there 's another side of life where the husband and wife are very happy . ' They do n't have to dabble in what it 's like with other people . ' If I leave Tom , I 'd be frightened . ' Cos I 'm so frightened of being on my own . ' ( Joy ) Can I have a cup of tea , please ? ( Menchat ) ( Joy ) ' I suppose my life 's over . ' Well , you only get one chance . ' I got a great pain in my heart yesterday . ' I really wanted to gas myself . ' I 've never felt that desperate before . ' Then again , you read all this stuff in the papers . ' You know
zone1	, locked up , and all the rest . ' Well , I do n't want my little Jonny , I do n't want him to be a result of that . ' You know , the result of a broken home . Cos that would be terrible . ' And that 's why I 'm trying . That 's why ... ' If I could find a bloke tomorrow ' who loved Jonny as much as he loved me ... ' ... well , I 'd go with him like a shot . ' Cos all you need is a man ' and a baby ... ' ... and a couple of nice rooms to live in . ' When you think of it , that 's all it comes down to . ' ( TV ) ' ... but generally dry . There could be the odd showers ... ' Where 's Jonny ? I do n't know . I thought he was with you . ( Joy ) I told you I was n't taking him with me . Well , I ai n't your baby minder
zone1	Have you seen Jenny anywhere ' ? No , I have n't , love . I 've had her in for an hour , give her tea and everything . - ( Joy ) Oh . - Do n't know where he can be . It 's half past seven , nearly , you know ? Shh , love ! He might be down the waste ground down there . There 's a load of kids playing . Jonny ! Oh , God . Jonny , are you ' m there ' ? Jenny ' ? Are you in there ? (
zone1	knocks_on_door ) Jonny ' ? Oh , no . Jonny ! ( Sighs ) Jenny , are you over there ' ? Jenny ' ? Are you ' m there ' ? Jonny ! 0h , my God ! ( Sob ) Oh . Jonny . Jonny . ! Jonny ! Oh , Jonny ! Oh , Jonny ! Oh , my baby ! Oh , my baby ! Oh ! Mummy thought , I thought I 'd lost you for ever and ever and ever . What
zone1	go ? - Yeah , we 'll go now . ( Sighs ) That 's difficult . I do n't know cos I dream about it a lot , but I really do n't know , if it came to it , I suppose it 's all big dreams , really . But if anything happened to little Jonny , I suppose I 'd become a brass . Oh , is there any perfect life ? I do n't think there is , really . People go on about how happy they are and what they got and what a lovely home they 've got and they 've got a new telly and they 've got new fitted carpet in the lounge . And I sit there and I think ... And I go on about it myself . I 'm always saying , " Oh , I want this and I want that . " But when you come down to it , I do n't think there is a perfect life , really . You just got ta make do with what you 've got and be happy
zone1	even talk about it . I always think of Dave . Cos he ... he brought out something that was inside me that I never knew was there . I ... You know , he was marvellous . I think about him all the time . If I ... If I listen to a record or something . It just ... You know , I just ca n't imagine he 's not here with me , cos it was so marvellous . And it 's terrible if you love someone . Why should they be taken away from you ? But I just think of the time when we 're gon na be together again . And I hope it 's not too long . Cos he was so different to Tom . He was soft and warm and ... It was ... It was fantastic . With Tom , he just , he 's insensitive . He does n't ... He never asks me if I 'm all right or ... You know , he thinks that money is everything . But with Dave , it was fantastic .

Screenplay by Bob Barbash Produced by Sy Weintraub Directed by Robert Day This is why I called you , Tarzan . This is what I wanted you to see . Ugly looking thing . Ugly and terrifying . Those claws are poisonous . It is the symbol of Barcuna . Barcuna leads a deadly cult dedicated to the killer instinct of the jaguar . This killer cult was once destroyed 3 centuries ago . But now this terrible thing has returned with all its monstrous effects . The first signs were found in the jungle beyond Marakeet and Caliba . And now it 's growing . A lightning circle of death and destruction . Barcuna marches through the jungle attacking and burning every village , and with each attack his power grows with new recruits for his cult . Afterwards only a few dead are found . The rest are taken as slaves . Where he takes these people
zone1	not know . Investigators we have sent into the area have never returned . You are the only man I know , who can track down this terror . The one man who can find Barcuna and crush him . Come , old friend . Let 's discuss it further as we walk . Hello , Cheetah . Hey , you put on some weight . You 're enjoying the treatment here . He has become our number one attraction . - - The children love him . - - Glad to see you , too . We can never thank you enough for donating him and the other animals . Good , Cheetah . Thank you . Come . You have more old friends to visit . Jungle tribes are difficult to enslave , Professor . How does this Barcuna keep a hold on them ? By preying on their primitive beliefs . Yes , Tarzan . Here we are , surrounded by the fruits of man 's progress . A modern civilization capable of sending men out into space . And yet , out there in the jungle
zone1	Professor ! - - There 's Baron ! - - Yes . Tarzan , I leave you with your friends for a while . I know how much they mean to you . All right , Professor . I wo n't be long . Hey , Baron . Baron ! Do n't you recognize your old pal ? Easy , boy . Yeah . You see , Cheetah ? Baron ! Give us a little more speed , Pepe . Yes , sir , captain Sam . When you get to those sand posts , stay on the right side of them . The dock is just around the bank . We 'll tie up there and let the motor cool off . Do n't rush me . I did n't say anything . Yeah , but I know what you 're thinking . I knock 3 kings , 3 jacks , 7 , 8 , 9 hearts , and I go down with 9 . Oh , let me see ... Three 5s , three aces , a king , a jack , a 10 of hearts , and
zone1	. I win 7 points . Deal the cards . - - You did n't mark to score . - - " You did n't mark to score ? " What 's the matter ? You think I 'd cheat a little kid ? Well , every time you win , you mark the score , and every time I win , you give excuses . All right , all right . Now satisfied ? Now , deal the cards , you juvenile delinquent ! Come on , come on , deal . Uh-uh , uh-uh , keep your hands where I can see them . What 's the matter ? You think I 'd cheat my old captain ? Now , how many times have I told you , huh ? This is a captain 's hat . It belongs on the captain 's head . Do you understand ? You promised him his own cap . Not until he gets a promotion . You also promised him a promotion . That 's when he gets his own cap . Now , come on . Let 's play cards
zone1	kibitz is on my hand . Boy , oh boy . That 's life for you . Work my fingers to the bone , and what do I end up with ? A 10 year old card shop and a fugitive from Bana Mambeli . Hey , let 's forget the game . I 'm sure the motor 's cooled off by now . Hey , wait a minute . I 'm beating you . Hey , now , when you 're gon na learn , huh ? What 's more important , a little card game or business ? Now what ? Come on , you put out the fire , and I 'll get the boat ready to ... Pepe ? Pepe ... Pepe , get in the boat . - - What is it , captain Sam ? - - Nice and easy , now . Had natural bad view . Stop ! You ! No move ! Go on ! Shoot ! Kill ! I know it 's a gun , and I know it can kill . - - Who are you ? - -
zone1	'm captain Sam Bishop . This is my first mate , Pepe . I saw your boat from up in the trees , Captain . I heard the shots and I got here as quick as I could . It 's a good thing you did . His gun jammed . Oh , he-he . It can happen to anybody . Captain , If I were you , I 'd take the boy and go back down river . Oh , I ca n't do that . It 'll be dangerous for you to go further . Oh , me and Pepe have been to some tight places before . See , mister , that boat there is mine , and we 're delivering some medical supplies to a doctor up in Caliba . I 'm getting paid $200 for the job , and for $200 , mister , I do n't go back for anything . Captain , if you do n't mind , I 'd like to go up river with you . I 'm going in that direction , and I might be of some help ,
zone1	show you that captain Sam Bishop is a man who shows appreciation for you there 's no charge . Captain Bishop ! A lion ! It 's all right . His name 's Baron . He 's my friend . He is your friend ? I 'd hate to meet your enemy ! Oh , Baron wo n't bother anyone as long as I 'm around . You mean , he travels with you ? On my boat ? He 'll be of no trouble . You have my word . All right , your word . What about his ? Okay , okay . Do n't be so ... I take your word , too . But he stays tied up in the cabin , okay ? All right , captain . I do n't get it . You mean , you travel with a chimp and a lion ? I have my reasons . Chief Barcuna , I have news from the great city . The professor in the city has been destroyed . But there was another man , a man from Africa . He is now
zone1	him come . Wow ! I think I can hunt them by a mile ! Aim is just as important as distance , Pepe . But you go ahead and practice a while . All right , Pepe , play time 's over . Your turn behind the wheel . Be careful with those mud banks , okay ? Keep on the right . That 's a nice pussy . I 'm your friend , pussy . Pussy , pussy , pussy ... Hey , are you sure you got him tied up ? I 'm sure , but I 'll check . Are you gon na be staying in Caliba , Tarzan ? No , I 'll be going deeper into the jungle , captain . Into the Marakeet country . Marakeet ? Pretty rough country up there . Now , why would you be going way up there ? You have n't heard some talks about some hidden treasure , have you ? No treasure . Just something I have to do for an old friend . Oh . Pepe ! Keep in the middle of the river
zone1	penalty for escaping . - - Take him to the pit ! - - No ! How long has the boy been with you , captain ? Oh , a couple of years . What happened to his parents ? He 's an orphan . Well , he must have somebody . As a matter of fact , the boy is a Marakeet . Those nice people beat him with the sticks and chased him out of their village . It seems that they think that an orphan brings bad magic . I found him wandering around the river banks . Been with me ever since . Do n't you think he 'd be better off at the mission , captain ? Now , what 's a mission gon na do for him ? Proper care . Peace and upbringing . Peace and upbringing ? What kind of talk is that ? You 're not one of those social workers , are you ? Now , look . That kid has plenty of fresh air , a good place to sleep , and 3 meals a day . Now ,
zone1	I 've just noticed that the boy is very bright . At the mission he 'd get a good education . Education ? Look , I 've been teaching him everything I know . All right . But I still think you worry about him a little . Me worry about him ? What for ? He 's not my kid . Now , where 's my cap ? Now , how many times do I have to tell you , huh ? You keep your hairy paws off of my cap . Now , here . Swab the deck . Everybody works on my boat . We 'll find a spot up the river we can spend the night . I think it 'd be best if we travel through the night , captain . Those medical supplies are marked " urgent " . Yeah , I guess you 're right . We 'll have to stop for an hour or so , and give the motor a chance to cool . This old boat ai n't as young as it used to be . Neither are you ,
zone1	I am the one ruler of all the jungle ! Barcuna 's blood is the blood of the jaguar . I have the power to destroy my enemies . I , Barcuna , have cursed the people of Marakeet , and they will all die . Those who defy me face death . Here you go , Cheetah . Now , that 's where you 've made your big mistake of the day . I take your queen of hearts , and I give you 9 of spades . And I take your 9 of spades , and I ... Captain , what 's the name of this game again ? Come on , you know the name of the game - - " gin " . Well , that 's what I 've got - - " gin " . Gin ? Four 9-s , three 6-s , and three jacks . I 'm stuck with 7 points . What 's the matter , kid ? Do n't you trust me ? Sure , but sometimes you do n't count so good . Where did you learn how to
zone1	so good " ? It 's " sometimes you do n't count so well . " Okay , but I want to see what you 've got anyways . 7 ? You 've got 37 ! Oh , come on . How could I have 37 ? I ... I ... I thought that 's queen , match the king . A diamond and a club ? Do n't be so smart , anyone can make a little simple mistake . Captain ... You 're not mad at me , are you ? No , I 'm not mad at you . You 're a good kid . But who likes kids ? Come on , deal the cards . Let 's deal from the top of the deck , huh ? They came ... attacked the village ... Barcuna ... drove my people out . Slaves digging holes in mountain ... to take out shiny stones ... Slaves ... White people ... I 'll bury him . Now , what was that he said about shiny stones ? I bet he was talking about diamonds . Yes , sir
zone1	all right ? I know he 's after something . Well , kid . The day Tarzan finds those stones , we 'll be standing there right alongside of him for our share . After all , we 're not charging him for the trip , are we ? Come on , kid . Too bad people do n't behave like that . Well , Tarzan , we 'll be there in a couple of hours . Caliba is just up there , on those hills . The approach is around the bend of the river , about two miles up . Okay , Peringa . Bye-bye . Uhu . Sit down , Panyo . Now ... Stop it ! Stop it ! Leave them alone ! Tell your people that the jungle belongs to Barcuna . Hey , captain ! Look at that smoke ! Oh , my gosh ! It 's Caliba ! I wonder if the doctor 's all right . I 'll meet you there . Full speed ahead , Pepe ! You 're doctor Phillips ? - - You come from Caliba ? - -
zone1	We ? Captain Bishop 's boat . You were traveling with captain Bishop ? Yes . What happened back there ? It was horrible . They came so suddently , they ... They herded the people off like animals . Do you know who they are ? One of the men , the leader , called himself Barcuna . Let me take you back to the boat . Why do n't we go into jungle and find Tarzan ? No , we 'll wait right here . But what if he is in trouble ? Oh , look , Pepe . I 'm trying to teach you all the angles . Do n't you see ? We go into the jungle that way ... Tarzan sneaks back this way , and he steals the boat . But why would he do a thing like that ? The diamonds , kid . The diamonds . He does n't want us around , you get it ? O-oh . Now , here 's the plan . As soon as Tarzan comes back , we go find the doc , deliver the medical
zone1	Tarzan that we 're gon na visit your sick uncle at Marakeet . And we invite him to come along with us , free of charge , then we can keep an eye on him all the time . Hey ... What 's an uncle ? What 's an uncle ? Let me see ... Did your father ever have a brother ? I do n't think so . Well , if he had a brother , that would be your uncle . Well , I do n't have an uncle , and that would be lying to Tarzan . Ah . Pepe , we 're not lying to Tarzan , we 're just telling him part of the truth . What part is the truth ? You had a father , did n't you ? Yeah . See what I mean ? Now , we 're gon na stay right here and wait for Tarzan , if it takes them up to sundays . He ai n't get to those diamonds before us . Captain Sam ... Oh , there you are . Pepe , get the motor started
zone1	just talking about you . I 'm glad you waited . Oh , I ai n't the kind of guy that runs out of a friend . You might have run into some trouble , and needed my help . Doc , I 'm glad to see you 're okay . No , thanks to you . You 'd do a week ago . Where are my supplies ? Ah , you do n't have to worry . Safe and sound aboard my boat . All right , Pepe . Get ready to shove off . Your boat looks like Noah 's Ark ! One of Tarzan 's pets . He takes a little getting used to . He wo n't bother you , doctor . You can go on board . - - What happened in Caliba ? - - It was burnt to the ground . Why do n't you take Dr . Phillips and go back to Masalva ? I 'm not going to Masalva . I heard about the epidemic in Marakeet , that 's why I sent for the vaccine . You saw what happened
zone1	'm a woman ? It 's not safe for a man or a woman . - - But you 're going up there , are n't you ? - - Yes , I 'm going . I want you to take the boy and doctor Phillips , and go back to Masalva . I 'll take the medicine with me . Then what ? I suppose you diagnose for diseases , give the injections , and then arrange the stop of spreading of it . Oh , no . I 'm going to Marakeet . Look , doctor . It just is n't safe . But you 're a big girl , so you do what you want . I did n't come to this jungle to be safe . You can argue forever , but I 'm going to Marakeet . And you , captain Bishop , are taking me there . Now , what you 're gon na do with a woman like that ? You could refuse to take her . Oh , I could n't do that , Tarzan . It 's kinda like a mission
zone1	say it is , you ca n't either . Stick with us . You know , lend a hand , in case anything happens . Yes , captain . Pepe ! Come on ! Come on , let 's go . We got ta get ready to shove off . Come on , come on ! Hey , kid . Everything is working out just fine . Now , you keep thinking about those big , huge , shiny stones . Tarzan ? Can I pet the lion ? Sure , Pepe . Go ahead . See ? He likes you . Animals sense when people are friendly . Did he ever eat anyone up ? I do n't think so . You know , I found Baron when he was that big . He was smaller than you , Pepe . Just wandering around all by himself . I looked for his mother , and I never could find her . Hey , he was an orpan like me ! That 's right , Pepe . You 've got Tarzan , and I 've got captain Sam . Tarzan
zone1	. Captain Sam , we 're being attacked ! Pepe , take the wheel . All right , chimp , my gun , fast ! They look like the same kind of Indians that attacked us before . No , captain . Take the boat to the shore , and wait for me . Let me shove , Pepe ! Keep turning that wheel , boy ! I got ta get some speed up . Come on . Come on . Captain ? Oh , it 's you . I never thought I 'd be seeing you again . You 're all right ? Yeah , I 'm okay . Where 's the doctor and Pepe ? Oh , I found a cave about a hundred yards up . I hid them there . Figured , they 'd be safe there for the night , than aboard the ship . Good idea . Tarzan , wait . What 's going on ? Listen , I 've been traveling this river for the last 15 years . Every single tribe knows me and my boat " The Jewel of the Andes
zone1	suddently , in the last few days I 've been attacked twice . What gives ? - - Have you heard of Barcuna ? - - Barcuna ? He 's the leader of an ancient killer cult that sprung up again recently . And they 're operating in this area . Killer cult around here ? But what 'd they want with me ? It 's not you , captain . It 's me . - - Then we can be attacked again . - - There is that chance . But why do n't you check on the doctor and Pepe ? I 'll meet you there . - - Now , what are you doing ? - - I 've got to turn Baron loose . - - You 're turning that lion loose , why ? - - I have to , he 's hungry . All right , all right . At least wait until I get into the cave . Captain . It 'll be best if you all stay here in the cave . Baron will be here soon , and I wan na
zone1	we have n't seen the last of those Barcuna characters . Got you a bit worried to , has n't he ? My only concern is to get to Marakeet on time to help those people . Another attack like this afternoon , and you do n't have to worry about going anyplace . Hey , you know what , doc ? First thing tomorrow morning I 'm taking the boat back to Masalva . But you ca n't ! Oh , no ? You just watch . I insist that you take me to Marakeet . Oh , doc . You can do all the insisting you want . We go back in the morning . All right , captain Bishop . Name your price , I 'll pay it . Sorry , doc . You know , for once in my life I ai n't aiming for a buck . The only reason I came this far is because I heard talks of diamonds . Now even that does n't interest me . Now look , doc . All I 've got in the world is me ,
zone1	I aim to hold on all three . And what about those people in Marakeet ? Some of them may be dying ! Epidemic spreads fast , captain . I can help them . Now , how can you help them ? Even if you 've got there at all in one piece , do you think those people let you stick them with that needle ? I can try . Oh no , doc . You come back to Masalva with us . You 'll be saving your own neck . Captain Sam ? Yes , kid . If we find those diamonds , we 'll be rich ! Oh , they are too big , kid . But you always said we 'll be rich . Maybe this is our chance ! Oh , look , Pepe . I 've been talking about hitting it bigger ever since I was a little guy like you back in New York . And I 'm gon na do it someday , too . You just watch . But now is not the time . We just got too much going
zone1	see he really wants you to go on ? Those are his people . He wants to help them . Help them ? Oh , you must be kidding , doc . After the way they treated him ? Why , they threw him like a dirty old rag ! Ai n't that the truth , kid ? Sure . Who cares about those people ? I was only thinking about the diamonds . Now you see what I mean , doc ? Those people do n't mean anything to him . Yes . I do see . Now , what happened to you ? We had a little more trouble . There , you see ? More trouble . Ann ... It 'll be safe if you go back with him . What about you ? - - I have to go on . - - So have I . An epidemic can be just as deadly as Barcuna . All right . We 'll go to Marakeet through the jungle . Are you two out of your mind ? I 'm offering you a ticket back . Free

Bunch of suckers , that 's all they are . They only want to help . Oh , fine . They 'll go play that tambourine someplace else . And you shut up and go to sleep . Oh , cover yourself . You 'll catch a cold away from the fire . Hey , level with me , kid . What do you really want to do ? I wan na stay with you , captain Sam . Me and you . We got ta stick together . Yeah . Yeah , sure , kid . You and me , right down to the wire . All right , all right . Till we all get ouselves killed , we go to Marakeet . Here . It 's been a long time since I 've seen you , Pepe . I
zone1	. I have to stay with captain Sam , Dr . Phillips . He needs me . Of course , he does . You save him paying someone a regular wage . Captain Sam says I 'm learning to trade , and that 's better than getting paid . Aha . That sounds like good old captain Sam . Business is business . Now you sound just like him . What 's that ? Have n't you ever seen one of these before ? No . This helps make sick people better . - - How ? - - " How ? " By injecting the medicine into the sick person 's arm . Like this . You mean , you stick that big silver dart into people ? Uhu . Only to help them , Pepe . You 'll see what I mean when we get to Marakeet . - - Dr . Phillips . - - Hm ? Do you know the jungle people in Marakeet ? No , I 've never been that far north . They will not let you use the silver dart , Dr
zone1	I know the people . They will not let you . Pepe . If you were sick , and I told you this would make you better , would n't you want me to help you ? No . It is bad magic . Oh , Pepe ... Your turn at the wheel , captain Sam ! Okay , Pepe , you go and rest . Captain Sam , can I go pet the lion ? Okay . But you make sure Tarzan stands alongside of you . Are you kidding ? He 'll be standing in front of me . Oh , he is a bright kid , ai n't he , doc ? Well , I wish he blew some of his native superstitions . You know , he was actually terrified of a hypodermic needle just now ? Well , what do you expect ? The boy 's from the jungle . But I 've been personally teaching him . Oh , you 've been teaching him , all right . Captain Bishop . You make Fagan look like a saint . Oh , doc . Now
zone1	am , taking you clear out of my way , and that 's the thanks I get . Who 's Fagan ? You have n't told me yet , how much more you 're going to charge for taking me to Marakeet . Not one red cent . Oh , look , doc . I wan na help those poor sick people out as much as anybody . You know , old captain Sam Bishop might have strayed once or twice , but I still got a heart . Medically speaking , perhaps . Oh , come on , doc . What 's eating you today ? I just do n't think you 'd do anything without putting a price tag on it . But I said , I ai n't charging you . Now , is n't that enough ? No . I know you too well . Oh , doc . Now , what I 'm gon na do with you ? There she is , doc . That 's Marakeet up ahead . That does n't look like a truly welcoming committee , does it ? No
zone1	. - - You are Manlo ? - - Yes . This is Dr . Phillips . She brings medicine for your people . No medicine can help my people . That 's not true ! I can help them . Your child is sick ? Not sick . Barcuna has put a curse of the living dead upon my people . Barcuna ? The Marakeets can not fight his curse . Already half of my people are dead . It 's not Barcuna , Manlo . It 's a sickness . And the doctor can help . It is the curse of Barcuna ! By morning my people will be destroyed . Is this how a great chief leads his people ? Will you allow your village to die without even trying to save it ? I think I can help your child and your people . Please let me try . This medicine ... Where is it ? It is the silver dart ! Bad magic ! Medicine , Manlo . Not magic . Hey look . I 'm not playing here or anything like that , I
zone1	I let the doctor inject me ... Maybe good for white man , bad for Indian . Pepe , these are your people . Would you take the medicine so they wo n't be afraid ? No . - - Not the silver dart . - - Pepe , it wo n't hurt you , I promise . Trust me , all right ? I trust you , Tarzan . I 'll do anything you want . - - But ... - - Pepe . These people will die . Hey , come on , kid . That 's a breeze . There 's nothing to it . Now , let 's see . The job ought to be worth about eh ... $20 ? Ought to be worth at least 25 ? That 's what I said , 25 . Come on , Pepe . Manlo , the boy is a Marakeet . He 's willing to take the medicine to show it wo n't hurt your people . There . All over . - - You mean , you 've finished ? - - Yes . It was
zone1	to my people . We 'll need the rest of the vaccine from the boat . All right . " Some kid " , huh ? Must be his upbringing . Stack these up for the doc . And these . Your people will show improvement by morning . Manlo . Where will I find Barcuna ? Barcuna ? Go past the mountains , he will be there . As soon as the sun is high . Destroy him , Tarzan . Hear me , the spirit of the jaguar 's pits ! The jungle belongs to me ! Those who obey me , live . All others die . You have seen me fight the people of Marakeet with the curse of the living dead . And today I will destroy them . No ! Do not fear Barcuna ! His magic is false . He has lied to you in order to enslave you . His only strength is your fear . There is no more curse upon the Marakeets ! The curse of Barcuna is broken . Barcuna 's only strength is your own fear ! You
zone1	Man to man . Clear the ramps ! Pepe . You sure you wo n't come back with us ? No , captain . I want to stay here a few days and help these people to get started . Are we going to see you back in Masalva , ai n't we ? " Ai n't we ? " Now , where did you ever learn to talk like that ? As soon as we get back to Masalva , you start school . Oh , come on , captain . Just because it kind of ill formed a little . School , mister , and that 's an order . I do n't want no kid around me that do n't talk good . You be a good boy , Pepe , and do what the captain says . Yep . - - Good bye . - - Good bye , Tarzan . And you remember , anytime you wan na ride on my little old boat , you just give me a haley , do you hear ? No charge ? Come on , Pepe . Thank

He 's been huddled over that brazier since half-past six , probably feels the cold , poor chap . [stammering] well , what does he want ? I do n't know , yet . But I expect we 'll soon find out . I got this cable today from Carl Jansen . - And what 's that to us ? - He 's in south America . And ? About six months ago , I began hearing rumors that Fu Manchu had turned about there . Fu Manchu ? ! So I sent agents out to investigate , the best of them being Carl Jansen . This is his cable to tell me that he 's getting close to Fu Manchu .

Yes , she was knocked down and killed by a car just outside this house . She was carrying enough poison in her body to ... kill a regiment , and yet , she gets killed by a car ! Look , look , I 've got my analysis here . Like to see it ? I ca n't see . I 'm blind . Blind ? Blind ? Petrie , have you ever heard of the " kiss of death " ? No . There 's an old Inca legend that some ... priestesses were immunized to the poison of a black cobra . They let themselves be bitten by the snakes , and then were sent out to kiss certain chosen victims . Somehow , the poison was transmitted . And after a few days , the victim died .
zone1	of receiving the kiss of death . And this is what you think you 've got ? I 'm sure of it . It 's the confirmation of my theory . Fu Manchu is in that region of south America , protected on one side by the Andes , and on the other by the Mato Grosso . Well , maybe that 's so , but how in heaven 's name are we going to get your sight back ? I 'm convinced that we can only find the answer to that in south America . We must go to Santa Cristabel , and find Carl Jansen . Yes , but are you sure you 're fit to undertake a long journey like that in your present state ? I have to . Fu Manchu is there , of that , I 'm certain . He found the poison , and only he may know the antidote . The news from Paris , Rome , Berlin , and Tokyo . Everywhere , success . What news from London ? Good ... and bad . Celeste is dead . - And

What about the mountain road from Santa Cristabel ? You always said it was a weak link on our defense chain . It 's bandit country . That land is covered with the force of experienced men .

I have to see the governor at once , it is of great importance . I am Sister Wagner from the mission service . Alright , so you 're sister Wagner from the mission service , huh ? Well , I 'm sorry , the governor has been in conference now for the last three days . You ca n't see anyone , I 'm afraid not . Stop her ! Checkmate . [laughing] - Excellency . - Go away ! But ... there is a woman . Give her a peso - - No , make it two . She is the doctor 's niece , Ursula Wagner . Ursula Wagner ? Your Excellency , I must see you ! Carl . Ursula . Carl , what are you doing here , and where 's my uncle ? I 'm dreadfully sorry . I have bad news for you . Your uncle 's dead .
zone1	This ... His Excellency has kept me here these past three days . Some stupid charge of murder . Good chess players are hard to find . I ca n't be too particular . Anyway , I withdraw the charge . The game is over . And what brings you here , Ursula ? I 've come from Melia . They need help , medical supplies , and food . But why ? Last night , the village was attacked by bandits . Plundered and sacked . Bandits ? Lead by Sancho Lopez . Excellency . The bandits were in turn attacked , and many of them killed . After the fight , at dawn , I returned to the village to give what help I could . One of the bandits is suffering a strange disease . He has been struck blind . [sobbing] Pedro ! Pedro ! where is that fool ? I must find Sancho Lopez ! Call out the guard and the police ! Call out the -- - But Sancho Lopez is prisoner already . Huh ? Prisoner ? Yes , he was captured and
zone1	their leader . Oriental ? ? ? Bring him out . [indistinct_shouting] [indistinct_shouting] He is an iron man . We will melt him . - Iron Maiden . - Primitive , but effective . Lopez is not moved by the lash , and he can do without food or water . But doubtless , he is proud of being a man . May your soul rot in hell . I am Sancho Lopez ! I would die before I even tell you the name of my dead wife . Interesting . Now , Sancho Lopez . Fu Manchu , you want to know where my friends are , eh ? And where I get my guns and my ammunition , eh ? You work for Nayland Smith . Nayland Smith ! - Who 's he ? [pained_groaning] For the last time , where is Nayland Smith ? I 've never heard of him . And I 'm in no one 's pay . And if you want to know where I get my arms , I buy them from the governor 's men . We have an arrangement . Release
zone1	He was telling the truth . [groaning] You know this country better than any man ? Very well . I will give you back your life . You shall work for me . You will seek out my enemies , and you will destroy them . - Care for a cup of tea ? - No . Well , if they do n't need a decent cup of tea in these backwards places ... No like tea . Tell me , which is right road to Melia ? - Melia ? - Yes . Are you asking me which is the way to Melia ? I hired you to take me to Melia . why do n't you know it ? I thought you knew the right road to Melia . Whoa ! Excuse me , do you speak English ? Yes , of course . can I help you ? Well , yes , as a matter of fact , this fool of a driver seems to have lost our way . Where were you going ? The jungle is no place to get lost in . Carl Jansen
zone1	Now you can lead me to Fu Manchu . The girl . ? ? You will accompany Sancho Lopez . Wherever he goes , you go . When he has accomplished his deed , by destroying Nayland Smith , you will destroy him with a kiss of death . You understand ? Remove her . [shouting] ? ? [screaming] I 'm ready . You know what to do ? - I know better than you think , Fu Manchu - - - what do you mean ? Your enemy is not Nayland Smith , but , uh , a man named Carl Jansen . - Father . - Let him speak . He passes himself off as an archaeologist . I believe he 's a spy . - For Nayland Smith ? - who knows ? He 's clever . I thought , at one time , he was spying on me . You would know this man if you saw him ? As I know my own brother . You want that I kill him , too ? You will be given guns and an escort of my dacoits
zone1	know that , that you trust me . You fail , and you die ! Succeed ... - How much do you pay me ? Freedom is not measured in terms of money . Take him to the grotto . Horses are ready . By tomorrow night 's full moon , it will be over . Why the full moon ? What 's so important about that ? The whole world will shortly learn how important it is . This sickness will finish when the moon is at its fullest . Until then , death will stand beside him at all times . Ursula ! - Oh . - Back so soon ? There was nothing to keep me at Melia . The mission sisters have gone taking care of the sick people oh , good , good . And Nayland Smith ? Well , he 's worse , I 'm afraid . I let him talk to Carl , against my better judgment . He 's very , very weak . We must save him , Dr . Petrie . Only an antidote as strong as the poison that
zone1	somewhere here . Nayland Smith talked quite clearly . There is a link between his illness and the ghastly plan of Fu Manchu . In Santa Cristabel , I heard the news . That all over the world , important people , heads of state , police chiefs , influential men have been struck down like nine-pins . What ? ! All have , at some time , have incurred the enmity of Fu Manchu . Look here , Doctor . Here 's Melia . And this is our position now . Here , I believe , in the heart of the jungle , is the hideout of Fu Manchu . Are you sure ? [chuckles] If I were , I would 've called up a regiment to attack the stronghold . It must be guarded like a fortress . But two might succeed where a hundred men might fail . Well , it ... well , it seems a desperate measure , but we 're running out of time . I agree . Do you think Nayland Smith will be safe here ? Yes , he 'll be as
zone1	is too thick for horses . I think we can do without your men . We have escorted you further than we were ordered to . Get back to Melia . Alright , mount up . [shouting] , [laughing] Filthy spy , talk ! Or would you rather I cut off your tongue ? I will tell you anything you ask of me . First , your name . Pinda . And who do you work for ? Is it Jansen ? Huh ? So it is . Now , tell me about Jansen . He is to meet me ... before sundown . Ride deep into the jungle ! [horse_neighs] We 'll have to leave the horses . - Cup of tea ? - Huh ? [gunshot] Let me . Once we get to the ridge , we 'll be in open country . Beyond that , the grotto . Here . [gunshots] Cold tea , no horses . I wonder why I go abroad . tensemusicbuilds ? [indistinct] [imitating_bird_calls] Come on , Petrie . Get back under cover . [laughing] **28;9616;TOOLONG [gunshots] **28;9646;TOOLONG [gasps] **28;9676;TOOLONG Fu Manchu ,
zone1	is an unexpected pleasure . Not for me . - Who is this girl ? - A nurse . I thought she might be useful , too . Lin Tang . See that se ? or Lopez is suitably rewarded . [laughing] So , Dr . Petrie , you have replaced the late , lamented Nayland Smith . Nayland Smith is very much alive , Fu Manchu . Indeed . Allow me to show you something , Doctor . Your friend , Nayland Smith , received the kiss of death , as did some of the most important men in the world 's capitals . Men known to be my closest enemies . But they are only the prelude to my drama , Dr . Petrie . The same poison that has been given to ten , can be given to millions . And shall be , if the world disobeys me . When the moon is full , those who have received the kiss will die at once . And then , I shall announce to the world that it lies completely within my power . As a further
zone1	to defy me I shall , at the same time , commit an act that will be long remembered . In these containers , is enough poison to destroy a thousand men . Multiply that ten thousand times , and ... Already my agents are nearing London , bearing with them such a gift . And upon my signal , the poisonous cloud will be released . That will be my message to the world . Capitulate , or the same death will be the fate of millions more . I do not doubt that after that , the rest of the world will accept my command . Already men are dying . And in the great cities of the world , my orders have been obeyed . We have travelled many miles to fulfill our master 's instructions . Now , we are about to perform our last serving . After we receive a signal from our master , we shall release the contents of this urn . Everlasting death . Horrible , inescapable , universal death . Get them out ! [chuckles] If I was n't an English
zone1	you pot-bellied bastard ! Ketlan . I remember you . We had a fight , eh ? Now , I win . Come with me . [laughing] In a few hours , the moon will be full . Carl must be out there somewhere . My tea is in my thermos on my back , and I ca n't get at it . He 's our only hope . [grunts] It 's getting cold , and I need it ! Dr . Petrie . Have you lost hope ? It 's like the grains of sand dropping through an hourglass . I ... we ... we have no time on our side , my dear . Do you believe that all of those men , Nayland Smith and the rest , will die when the moon comes up ? Yes , and I feel worse than death . The whole of London will be destroyed because of this terrible plan of Fu Manchu , proving to the world that he has the power of infinite destruction . [strained_groans]

There is no way out here . come on ! How 's your head , Lopez ? [chuckles] My head ? Huh ? Could n't be
zone1	as you come , my friends . You ca n't get away on your own . With this , I can go to hell and back . Ah ! Now , lose yourselves , or I start shooting . - Sancho , you ca n't ! - she 's right . Ursula . watch ! Hurry . Here . - Thank you . If you value your hide , make no sound . They must have escaped by the old tunnel . Carmen knows the way . They will not go far . But if they should manage to reach the waterfall ? They will not escape . From this vantage point , a man could hold up an army . Who wants to hold off anybody ? For heaven 's sake , man !

zone1	's never had anybody else behind the wheel since then . Right ; - Over here , this is [Bobby] Macoon . - We talked on the phone . - Were you the one ; - Yeah .

zone1	trick . In one second I make him dead and catch him before he hits the floor . When the time comes , I 'll make him dead myself . [Frank] ... I want you to shake hands with Ace Williams . From now on , treat him like a brother . Last year , I worked my brother over so bad ... Now , [Frank] ! That 's better . I 'm not having any internal conflicts . Besides , you ought to show some respect . When Ace Williams kills somebody , he stays killed . He got sloppy . Do n't rub it in too hard . He feels real bad about it . All right , gents , let 's get down to business . Find places on the couch . [Rinzy] , set up the screen . - l been waiting for this . - Back in business . It 's been a long time , [Joe] . It 's got to be the U.S . Mint or [Joe] would n't bother . - Maybe bigger . - Wait till you hear . Now ,
zone1	I wanted the best . First class for a first-class job . Everything I 've done before adds up to nothing compared to this . All right , [Francis] . - Put out the lights . - Yes , sir . This is where we 'll be working . The Manhattan Museum of Art . We 're going to knock off a museum ; And this is what we 're after . " Field of Sunflowers " by Dubreau . Your big trick is to break into a museum and steal one lousy picture ; [Rinzy] You 're kidding . I had fire in my hands getting in shape . One lousy picture . I could carry it away . If you 'll shut your ignorant yaps , I 'll set you guys straight on a few facts . First , it 's not a lousy picture . It 's a very fine picture , a very famous picture worth around 600 G's . 600 G 's ; And second , it 's 40 feet long . A whole room . So do n't talk like you 'll stick it
zone1	picture is so famous , how you going to unload it ; I 'm not going to unload it . I 'm going to keep it . When I go to my final rest , and the world finds out who took that picture , my name will be famous . After you 've cashed in , you want people to know you caught this picture ; In my will , I 'm giving this picture back to the museum . And maybe a million extra if they 're willing to change the name of the place . The Leo Joseph Smooth Memorial Museum . Leo ; Do n't make one crack . Change the slide . The museum bought " Sunflowers " in Paris last month and had it shipped to New York . This room has been set up special . Tomorrow night , they 're giving a reception for the curator of the museum to unveil the picture . When do we grab it ; After the reception , before the public ever gets to see it . - [Fingers] Tomorrow night ; - [Bobby] Why the
zone1	. Many a prize trick has been spoiled because of a leak . You do n't have to worry about any of us . You 're right . You are n't leaving this house until tomorrow when we go to the museum . - [Cowboy] lt ai n't fair ! - [Fingers] I do n't like that ! [Joe] That 's the way it is ! Instead of complaining , I suggest you study the operation , of which I worked out every detail . Let 's see the picture . [selects_slide] Now " Field of Sunflowers " is a triptych . A what ; [Joe] That means it was painted in three sections . So in order to move it , we 'll have to divide it . Over here and over here . [Florian] Please , it wo n't happen again . Do n't tell [Joe] . - [Joe] Ace , put the lights on . - [Florian] Wait ! You ca n't go in there ! What 's going on ; I 'd like another car and driver to take me home . - Something 's wrong
zone1	; A new car . Less than 1 , 000 miles and it 's broken ; Quite possibly , it was not built to withstand crashing into a tree . Of course that 's just an opinion . I am not a mechanic . - You rapped up the car ; - Well , she hit me . I slapped him for the classic reason . - All I did was ... - l know what you did . The kid got out of hand . He 's sorry . It 's no great disaster . What are you always bleeding for ; Let me make something clear . I come here as an art instructor only . You do n't have to worry . - We have other cars . We 'll just ... - The Sunflowers ! Oh , [Francis] ... I 'll have someone else drive you home . " The Field of Sunflowers . " Why are you showing that here ; I should n't have to remind you there are people who appreciate art . These people ; There must be some other reason .
zone1	; I just happened to think I do n't have another car available . You mind staying here tonight ; I 'd rather not . I have an appointment in the morning . - How about the train ; - lt 's too late for the train . [Florian] , you show Miss [Inwood] upstairs . I really should get home . Tomorrow maybe we 'll get another lesson . - Tomorrow I have ... - Now , tomorrow . Keep your hands to yourself or I 'll take them away from you . - Too bad she had to see that picture . - She do n't know what it 's about . Think she 'll remember seeing it when she hears about the museum being knocked over ; She 'll remember a lot of other things I asked her about . You 're taking art lessons because she knows about the museum . I 'm taking lessons from her because she 's a good teacher . If I picked up a little information on the side , that 's well worth it . - l got a bargain
zone1	up with a room ; You 're gon na knock her off . [Joe] Do n't be anxious . She owes me a couple lessons . If you let her live , she 'll shoot her mouth off . Do I need you to tell me ; Let 's get down to business . At the reception , a catering service is going to hand out champagne and hors d'oeuvres . After it 's over , they 'll stay to clean up . They and two guards will be all the people left in the building . Those caterers are going to be you . How 's it going to be , [Joe] ; We hijack the caterer 's truck , that 's how . The painting will leave in the caterer 's truck . You 'll be there to tell us what to do ; You 'll know what to do before you leave . I am attending the reception . Miss [Inwood] got me an invitation . - What about the guards ; - Well , they 'll have to be killed . Quietly . Let 's see
zone1	. One of the guards will stay close while the caterers are in the kitchen . Probably around here . The other , that 's going to be tougher . He 'll be making rounds . He may be upstairs . Maybe down . Maybe outside . You take a look around . When you find him , you walk up with a tray of food , compliments of the catering service . He thanks you . He relaxes , and then you kill him . How do you figure you 'll do it ; - Do what ; - Kill him . Maybe a shiv at the base of the medulla oblongata . Or maybe I 'll paralyze the clavichord . All depends on how I feel at the time . Medulla oblongata . Well , in every art form , there 's an element of spontaneity . I 'm the first to appreciate that . Get the plan in your mind , and remember , you 'll have to find the other guard . And as for you ... you 'll have to serve properly . The people
zone1	Food is all prepared . All you have to do is get it out . All right , [Cowboy] , you come along with me and let 's practice serving . [yells] Ace ! You 're sneaking booze . No ! Me ; Well , just a little one . I 'll let you cross me this time because you 're a special visitor , but do n't try crossing me again . - No booze for Ace . - And no broads . Well , that 's rough , [Joe] . He gets tanked just smelling the cork . Pepe warned me . He do n't look tanked . Yeah . How come he ai n't tanked ; Hey , [Cowboy] , where 's your horsey ; Watch them fingers , [Fingers] . Everybody on stage for the lineup . - Lousy lush ! - Now , hold it . [Joe] ln his condition , he 's not responsible . [Francis] , take him upstairs to sleep it off . I can take my own self upstairs . I do n't wish to be a burden to anyone .

What do you got to eat here ; To tell you the truth , I 'm a little ... When you 're a little ... it 's good to take a little something to eat . Care for some milk with those dog biscuits ; Do I look like a milk drinker ; Good night . Where 's my room ; Straight upstairs and to the right . Hey . Where 's that art teacher hang her canvas ;
zone1	instead of right . You 're a sweetheart . Miss [Inwood] . - Miss [Inwood] . - Who 's there ; Wrong room . - Mr . Williams ! - l made a mistake . - A mistake ; - l 'm sorry to bother you . It 's no bother . lt 's a pleasure . Sit down and visit . - Would you like a drink ; - No , thanks . - What would you like ; - Nothing . Try a little brandy with soda . That 's what [Joe] likes . I should get back . You can take time for one drink , ca n't you ; It gets lonesome around here sometimes . Lonesome ; In this place ; It 's full of guys . That bunch ; They do n't know anything except the things they know about . Except [Joe] , of course , and he 's busy all the time . Have a seat . When you 've been in show business , you miss that excitement all the time . - You were in show business ; - l
zone1	As a matter of fact ... Of course . Who is n't ; It 's universal . What 'd you do in show business ; That 's you ; It certainly is . It 's probably the hair that threw you . Autographed it to yourself . They called us the " Scandals on ice " . I had two seasons in the chorus and then a specialty . I 'll show you . See ; " [Melanie] Marie . Heat wave at the North Pole . " I was on the cover of Look , me and two other girls . I 'll show you . Miss Marie , could we do this later ; It has been so long since anyone called me that . - lt 's not my real name . I made it up . - We were n't introduced . I 'm terribly sorry . I 'm [Melanie] Smooth . - [Melanie] what ; - Smooth . I 'm [Joe] 's wife . - Very nice talking to you , Mrs . Smooth . - You have n't finished your drink . Yeah .
zone1	in The Arabian Nights . - Did you ever see the " Scandals " ; - l never did . Well , you really missed something . It was gorgeous . Big production numbers and beautiful costumes . And the finale . I came down this winding staircase in a fur cape ten yards long . The lights dimmed . The audience gasped as I took it off . [gasps] And then there I stand , all in rhinestones . - How many ; - That magazine cover 's here somewhere . Then the star came out on a sleigh pulled by eight little chorus boys . I might have been a star if I stayed long enough . I 'll bet you would have . You had to be real good to be a star . Anyway , I gave it all up for [Joe] . Well , they say marriages and careers do n't mix . - That 's true . - What are you doing here ; Hey , [Cowboy] ! [Joe] told you to sleep it off . You 've been spying on me , old
zone1	drunk . - He 's drunk ; - Just look at him . - Just look at me . - l only gave him one drink . [Joe] 's going to be sore . We wo n't tell him . What he does n't know wo n't hurt him . I did n't know . Why did n't you tell me ; Nobody tells me anything . - Goodness ! - You 're a nice lady . - You remind me of my Aunt Gladys . - l do ; She could n't ice-skate , but she was a sweetheart . I brought your purse . - You left it in the car . - Thank you . You certainly believe in living up to your reputation . Miss Smooth , [Joe] said to give the teacher something to sleep in . There . Easy , boy . She died , [Cowboy] . It certainly does have an effect on him . I 'll help you to your bunk . That little bit of sunshine went away forever . What are you talking about , Ace ; Who died ;
zone1	go sometime . - Only person who ever loved me . - Now , pull yourself together . I 'd give anything if I could see her again . What happened to her ; She was making book in Oakland and they caught her on the take and dropped her in the bay . That 's rough . I 'll be all right now . Get some rest . We got a big job ahead of us . Thanks a lot , [Cowboy] . You 're a good cowboy . [barking] , growling [barking] [whispers] All right . All right . [tapping_on_window] - What on earth are you doing ; - Let me in , quick . - Go away . - No . Want me to fall and break my neck ; Would you ; That 's a terrible thing to say . Well , be insulted and go away . - You do n't understand . - Do n't you come in here . Go see the lady next door . You 're more her type . I 'm not that type . That 's a pretty good
zone1	it . Excuse me . - What are you doing ; - The dog . It was an imitation . I was playing a part . I 've been playing parts all night . Pretending to be a drunk , a gangster . If I was drunk , could I balance on this ledge ; Maybe . I 'm a victim of circumstances , just like you . My name is [Jack] Albany . I 'm an actor . That 's why you thought you knew me . You 've probably seen me on TV . Look . I only watch documentaries . Not only TV . A couple of months ago , I did Twelfth Night at the Phoenix Theater . - You do know the Phoenix Theater . - Yeah . I saw Twelfth Night . - Then you remember me . - No , I do n't . I played Malvolio . [loudly] " Never ... [whispers] " Never was a man thus wronged , but do not think me mad . " Oh , brother . " l have been laying here in hideous darkness .
zone1	I got a copy of the review . He said that my Malvolio ... - Help . - You really are insane . Whatever you say . Just help me up . [Inwood] I 'm trying . - Here . Read for yourself . - [knocking] Hide . [indistinct_chatter] [barking] I have n't got any more . I would n't hold out on you . - Mr . Williams , you need some help ; - Nope . Do n't you worry . I 've got you . - This is very dangerous up here . - lt certainly is . [barking_continues] [yells] Shut up , Caesar ! - What 's going on here ; - Hi , [Joe] , honey ! [Melanie] , disappear . What are you doing ; Just out for a stroll in the fresh air . Look out . I ran into that lady that reminds me of her . - Remind you of who ; - Poor Aunt Gladys . [Joe] I suggest you get inside . You 're liable to find yourself in a straitjacket . That 's what they did to poor
zone1	when they dropped her in the bay . She could n't swim . [Joe] Ace , I need you tomorrow , so I do n't want you hurt . You get hurt , I 'll kill you . - Now , go to bed . - Good night , [Joe] . See that he stays in his room till he sleeps it off . Shut up , Caesar ! Yeah , shut up ! The things I have to put up with . A lesser man would break down . Hey , Ace . I hope you 're feeling better . Yeah . Better . - l could use a couple aspirin . - Why , certainly . - You can keep the whole tin . - Thanks . Where 's the boss ; - Busy . - There 's someone here to see him . When the boss is busy , he 's busy . You better tell him . He says he 's Ace Williams . I could use some water with these aspirin . - We have some water right ... - ln a glass . I
zone1	like that . He wants you . Downstairs . - What 's up ; - You tell me . - l do n't like riddling , punk . - Who 's riddling ; You are . Riddling and grinning . - l ai n't doing nothing . - You just keep doing that . - You look in good shape . - Nothing keeps me down for long . - That 's what I like to hear . - l snap back like a whip . Wish the trick was tonight . I 'm itching for some action . Maybe we can arrange something . [Cowboy] , how 's it going ; Somebody here I 'd like you to meet . - Meet him or kill him , you name it . - This is Ace Williams . Who 's he ; What 's the matter ; He deaf or something ; Well , I 'll try again . Ace Williams , meet Ace Williams . That 's funny , [Joe] . He arrived at the gate a few minutes ago . This is crazy . You do n't even
zone1	ringer , get someone who looks the part . - Who 's they ; - Do n't ask me . Ask the phony . - Who 's they ; - l do n't know . Pepe told me to ... He knows about Pepe . They 're very thorough . Who 's they ; Phony , we got ways of making you talk . is this a nuthouse ; I come East to do a job for [Joe] Smooth . I come in blind because Pepe says it 's okay . This is what I get . I 've got a pair of Aces . I 've got to discard one . You 've got one Ace . And a joker . Look , phony . You know Ace Williams ' reputation ; You could get yourself killed real quick . That 's right . - Suppose you try it ; - lt 's up to you , boss . Want me to make this joker dead ; Relax . Let 's see if we ca n't do it the easy way . I 'm suggesting the easy way .
zone1	. I got rolled . That 's why I did n't make it to the warehouse . I got mixed up with this redhead . She gave me a mickey and took my wallet with $600 . I woke up in an alley . I told better stories in nursery school . That 's an insult to [Joe] 's intelligence . Broads always was trouble for me . Yeah . Pepe said so . You got some l.D . ; Well ; I do n't like lowering myself . Be a lot more dignified if you just let me kill him . - Let him do that . - Excuse me , [Cowboy] . - Hey , [Joe] . - Yeah ; - l got an idea . - What idea ; You want to find out which is the big killer , right ; Put them both in a room , lock the door , and the one that comes out is him . - Not bad . - That 's pretty corny . Just show us the room and let me at him . Got style . Reminds
zone1	chance that neither one will come out . Do n't you count on it . We 'll do it . We 'll use the library . Shut up , you greasy little punk . We want to keep this contest absolutely fair and square , so no weapons of any kind . - Okay with you ; - Uh-huh . Okay ; Lights on or off ; - Any preferences ; - Nope . However we find the room , that 's the way it stays . Off . New Ace to the left . Old Ace to the right . Have a good game . I 'll be waiting outside to see who comes out Ace high . You know what I got a taste for ; Popcorn . Yeah . [whispers] Mr . Williams ; Mr . Williams ; We 're a couple of intelligent , civilized men . We do n't have to settle our differences like savages . I 'm sorry , Mr . Williams . Why do n't we just sit down and talk this thing over ; If two men in a situation like
zone1	, too , can learn to reason instead of fight . Hi . Yeah . Perhaps from the seed of concord we plant here tonight , a great fruit-bearing tree will grow . An umbrella of peace , spreading its branches over the whole beautiful world . An international brotherhood of every race . You 're going to kill me . [thud] - What are you doing here ; - See if I killed him . You did n't kill him . - You 're quite a girl . - Thank you . [sighs] - l 'm sorry . - lt 's an old machine gun wound . It unnerved me . You mind if I call you Sally ; When you guys came in , I was hiding . I was trying to get to the telephone . - Don't . - What ; They got a switchboard . You finally remembered seeing me in Twelfth Night . How did you know to hit him ; It was obvious which one was n't the professional killer . " An umbrella of peace ... " - l did pretty good
zone1	to be critical . - How did you get in this mess anyway ; - Mistaken identity . I did a television show tonight . On my way home ... How could you have seen Twelfth Night and not remember me ; All of the critics raved . Walter Kerr ... He 's moving . - He 's not . - l 'm sorry . I had to bring you down to Earth . [Joe] and his friends are waiting . You 're going to have to be making your triumphant reappearance . Yeah . I ca n't leave you here alone . That 's very nice . Excuse me . - There 's a big dog out there . - Caesar ; He knows me . There 's a fence , too . If you handle the dog , I can climb the fence . It 's electrified . What ; I was wearing a long wig . That 's why you did n't recognize me . - He 's moving . - Stop . - Really ! - He is ; - Where are you going ; -
zone1	, I 'll go back to my room . I 'll be okay . Listen , come see me later . - Thank you . - What for ; - For saving my life . - l 'd do that for any great actor . - Thanks . - Good luck . - [Bobby] Who won ; - [Fingers] Look who 's standing . - l did n't hear nothing . - That settles it . You did n't even get rumpled . How 'd you do it ; Just an ordinary Australian neck clop . He ai n't dead . What ; The neck clop disables . It does n't kill . Why 'd you want to use that clop for ; If I kill him , his mouth is sealed forever . - Let it be sealed . - Then you never find out who " they " is . Yeah . That 's good thinking . Lock him in the cellar . I 'll tell you something . I knew all the time you were the real Ace . Get a good night 's sleep . We
zone1	. Hey , Pops . [Joe] 's right . You need your rest . You wash your glasses . You 'll lose your license . Have a good night 's sleep , [Cowboy] . I sleep better in the open , [Rinzy] . [Bobby] 600 G 's for one picture . Why do n't we do some painting ; [Francis] Can I get you anything else , boss ; [Joe] No thanks , [Francis] . Better turn in . [Francis] Good night . [both_gasp] - Are you all right ; - l 'm fine . - Something very peculiar is happening . - What ; I was down there worrying more about you than about myself . What does that mean ; - l do n't know . - Think I 'm in love with you ; I 've never been in love with anyone before . Except myself . I 've got goose bumps all over . It 's probably just a reaction to my saving your life . You 're confusing love with gratitude . Yeah , maybe . Maybe . Why was [Joe] showing that picture of
zone1	. - At the reception ; - Afterwards . We 're going to impersonate the catering service . I have to kill two guards quietly . I ca n't kill two guards quietly . What am I going to do ; What 's the schedule ; 1 0:00 briefing in the morning and after lunch is a dress rehearsal . The guys hijacking the truck leave at 3:00 . - Then the rest at 3:30 . - No one 's going or coming before then ; There is no one going or coming before then . [Joe] 's playing it close . - You know , you 're beautiful . - No . - Yes , you are . - My nose is wrong . I like your nose . It 's too short and has no bridge . I 've done self-portraits . How did you get mixed up with [Joe] Smooth ; He came to an exhibit of my things in a gallery in the Village . He bought three paintings and hired me . - Did n't you know what he was ; - l did n't
zone1	and a struggling artist can use money . And I 've never been very much afraid of anything . Of course I admit , I 'm afraid now . - We 're both having new experiences . - l guess it 's all up to you . With the electric fence , guards , and the switchboard , there 's not much hope of our escaping . But tomorrow when you get out ... - l 'll be with [Joe] . - You 'll get word to somebody . - No , I won't . - lf nowhere else , at the party . - There 'll be over 1 00 people . - They 'll be watching me . They do n't suspect you . Just keep playing the part of Ace Williams as brilliantly as you 've done so far and wait for the right moment . The thing is , it 's our only chance . - l 'll try . - l know you will . Will you be safe ; Yeah . I do n't think [Joe] 's going to worry about me until tomorrow
zone1	one 's in the cellar . - Our Ace in the hole . - Let me do the bad jokes , please . Sorry . You better go . Sally , everything 's going to be all right . Keep telling yourself that till you believe it . When you really believe it , convince me , will you ; There 's an entirely different approach we could take of this . - lt 's our last night . - Say good night , [Jack] . Night , [Jack] . - Mr . Williams ; I found it . - What ; The Look magazine cover . I put it in my scrapbook so I could frame it . Then I kept forgetting to go to the frame shop . I never get to town anyway . How are you ; You certainly were under the influence . Oh , that , yeah . I did n't notice till you were on that ledge . It 's poison . There was a boy like that in the Scandals . A trick skater . One day he tried to jump six
zone1	. In no time at all , he drunk his career away . lt was really sad . Me . On the cover of Look . - You did n't believe me . - Sure I did . A real celebrity . Why , you 're very nice . - When you have n't been drinking . - Thank you . You 're very sensitive . You 're not like them . [Melanie] lt 's hard to believe you 're what you are . Some people are n't what you think . - [Frank] Are n't we cozy ; - Get lost , [Frank] ! Did n't anybody mention that she belongs to [Joe] ; - You think I 'm a piece of property ; - Yeah . Stay away from her . - l got rights . - What rights ; You 're just a broad . You got anything to say ; - How ' would you like a fist ; - You would n't dare . - Would n't I ; - No . Yes , I ...

In fact , do n't talk any more than you have to . That 's a good general rule . And no hat . - [Bobby] . ls that gum in your mouth ; - Yeah . - No gum . - No gum . When the reception is over , you take everything back into the kitchen and start cleaning . [Frank] , [Florian] , you be the dishwashers . [Bobby] and [Cowboy] , you 'll do the packing . Now , it 's your part , Ace . Let 's go through it . - Boss , it is time for your ulcer pill . - Yeah . Just a minute . Stay right there . You can be the guard . - Yeah ; - l do n't have to rehearse my action . This is a dress rehearsal . Everybody plays his part . [Francis] ,
zone1	ask him very friendly-like if he would n't like some hors d'oeuvres . Some hors d'oeuvres . You put down the tray ... - What if he says no ; - He won't . - l won't . - Maybe he 's not hungry . He wo n't say no . I promise . Now , you ask him , you put down the tray , and then you kill him . - l ca n't do it . - What ; It 's tough to fake a kill . I might get carried away and do it . That 's how sincere I am . Can you spare him ; I 'll tell you what you do . After you put down the tray , put your hands in your pocket . You move in on him , figure out your stroke , but do n't actually do it . - Okay ; - l 'll try . Good evening , Officer . Thought you might like a snack . Thank you . I 'm hungry at this particular moment . That 's fine . Hey , Ace ;
zone1	I mean ; - You 're a real hotshot . Do n't forget to put on the electric . Keep the home fires burning . Right , boss . - Do you believe in destiny , Ace ; - What ; I said , do you believe in destiny ; Yeah . Yes , I do . So do I . Every once in a while , I feel like I have a date with destiny . You do . You know , we all do . - l can remember ... - Sometimes it 's hard to see where you 're going , but then you get there and you say , " Of course . " Like I said , I can remember back in 1 935 when I knocked over the Metropolitan Bank ... I look at me right now . Here I am on my way to help the theft of a world-famous painting in the company of a bunch of people I did n't even know until last night . Why ; I mean , what 's it all for ; - l hired you

I hate to put her out of business . I kind of like her . I 'll bet she 's a good teacher . Good teachers are hard to come by . I 've learned about everything she has to teach . Wait till she sees " Sunflowers " in the grand salon .

Did he say how it happened ? He has n't said . He has n't said a word . Has there been any brain damage ? Mrs . Anderson , there 's someone here to see you . His brother , I think he said . Oh , Eddie , it 's Michael . - What the hell happened ? - Michael . I had to go through his wallet . He had a whole ... Did you know he
zone1	n't said a word since ? Not a word . I asked Dr . Leibman , my psychoanalyst , to come and have a look at him . Michael . Michael , can you ... ? Can you stay for a few days ? - Can you , please ? - Yes . He had a good night last night . You had a good night , Eddie . Pop sends his usual . Same old stuff we were brought up on . He has n't changed a word since we were kids . From the strictly medical point of view there 's no reason why he ca n't continue his convalescence at home . When it came right down to it , you put your head down , did n't you ? Ellen 's going back to school on the plane with Michael . Is n't that nice , Eddie ? So take care of yourself , Eddie . I 'm going back East . I 'll give your best to Pop . Okay ? Eddie . Daddy , you can hear what I 'm saying . You could
zone1	you want to , right , Daddy ? Hey , Florence . I meant to ask you : Has this got anything to do with that business of a year or so ... ? No . No . Really . Remember , when we were married , how he refused to wear a wedding ring ? Well , right before the accident he took me down to Lawson 's and bought us both wedding bands . I never felt so married . Oh , here 's his boss . - Florence , darling . - Hello , I 'll be right with you . How 's our boy ? Among all the animals of the plains , the giraffe has no voice . Even when its neck is in the lion 's mouth , it can not protest its own murder . These friendly looking citizens are members of the wild dog family . They always work as a team . And you can always spot their leader . Their manner , as you see , is casual and very relaxed . But do n't let those little wagging tails
zone1	them as she strolls by . Eddie , look who 's here . Here we see them running down a Tommy . A Thomson 's gazelle . - Eddie . - Notice how lackadaisical their manner is . Hello , Eddie . How you feeling ? Hi , Eddie . Looking great , Eddie . They do n't seem to be hunting at all , do they ? The gazelle seems to have slowed down just a step or two . That 's all it takes . But their rather ordinary appearance and casual-seeming behavior in no way suggests the ferocity with which they pull down their prey and proceed to devour it . Now , do n't worry about the accounts at the office because things are going great . Usually tearing the flesh off the animal while it 's still living . Will somebody turn this damn thing off ? I was trying to say , Eddie , that I want you to take it easy because Ben and Charlie are doing a great job filling in for you . Yes , Eddie , take your time .
zone1	Eddie . Do n't worry , Ben , I 'm not coming back . - Eddie . - What 'd he say ? He says he 's not coming back . Eddie , are you nuts or something ? Now snap out of it and get your ass back to the office . I need you . You 're my indispensable man . You remember , Ella ... I mean , Florence . You remember a couple of years ago we were having trouble with Zephyr ? Take a look at this . I think we got phase one licked . What do you think ? Not too subtle . Now , we use black letters on a yellow background that will ... What 's the matter ? Eddie , I want you to drop everything and concentrate on Zephyr . Zephyr . You disappeared for a couple of days . And I did n't know where you were . But I knew that you were somewhere working on Zephyr . What did you do today , dear ? Got the angle for Zephyr . Knew you would . I
zone1	cough . I tell you , Florence , when he starts to sell , he 's like a different person . Like , inspired . Now , let 's face it . The smokers of the world are scared . Without mentioning the dirty word , we know what they 're scared of . Frankly , it 's gon na take more than good advertising to change their mind . It 's gon na take a product . And you gentlemen have that product . The Zephyr cigarette . Eddie . Eddie , you were great that day . Just great . How could anybody be afraid of a cigarette made with glycerin ? It takes the hardness out . Softens tobacco , makes it taste smoother , but more important it makes the cigarette burn more evenly . Now . What 's another way of saying " burn more evenly " ? The word is " clean . " The clean one . Gentlemen , may I present A Time to Live . There 's a time to live when everything is clean , fresh , young and good
zone1	to take it . Just great . Eddie . And when you do , take along Zephyr , the clean one . Made to burn clean with ... She 's beautiful , is n't she ? Zephyr . The clean one . Part of your time to live . That 's it , gentlemen , that 's all . " The clean one . " Do you realize the significance of that claim ? I 'm sure you do . Thank you . Thank you . That 's it . Eddie , marvelous presentation . - Bye-bye . - Thank you . - Just doing a great job . - Really an excellent presentation . What the hell are you always laughing at ? - Do you mind ? - Yeah . - When it 's at me . - Oh , Eddie . Will you cut it out ? Been around here three months . Every time I look at her , she 's sneering . I 'm just wondering . - Wondering what ? - Same thing you 're wondering . Why do you always have her ,
zone1	always . Just when I wan na get a reaction to something . You know , she 's on my personal payroll because she 's got a built-in crap detector . Very useful . So you watch it . You 're great . Delicious . May I have another one ? - Yes , of course . - Beautiful grapes . What are they , Thompson Seedless ? What ... What amuses you ? All right . We 'll talk some other day perhaps , huh ? We 'll have another little talk , just a little chat . And he 's been this way all along ? He 's said exactly one sentence since the accident . And that was ? " I 'm not going back . " To work , he meant . Mrs . Anderson , as your analyst I must warn you . Something serious is going on here . Yes , but what ? Tell me what . For one thing , I think we should stop calling it " the accident . " - That 's an inaccurate ... - That 's what
zone1	peasant always hangs himself in the landlord 's doorway . Oh , bosh . I 'm not his landlord , I 'm his wife . But is he your husband ? I 'm sorry . I can discuss that . Remember how he used to be ? Well , ever since he broke up with her , he ... Well , I told you . He 's lost all interest in it . Not only with me , but as far as I can tell , with anyone . Well , " It 's better than if he were off with some tramp , " I tell myself . " More to marriage than sex , " I tell myself . By the way , I have your check . You 're really convinced there was nothing more to that relationship ? A sex thing . Pure and simple . She was the office tramp . That happens . I understand that . Now , I must admit , there are nights when I feel ready to go through the roof . I 'll fire that girl . If he
zone1	it 's highly unlikely that he 'll ever leave you , is that it ? Because he 'll never find anyone who 'll put up with what you had to ... That 's the way I am . I waited that bitch out and I 'm going to wait this out . I 'm raising the question , is this what 's best for you ? That 's the way I am ! Well we can never be too sure of that . Let me just say this . In every suicide , there 's an element of revenge . He 's very angry with somebody . Probably himself , but ... - I hate ... - Who is it you hate , Eddie ? Is it me ? Eddie , tell me . - Oh , I wish , just for once ... - Do n't ! Trust me enough to tell me what she meant to you . I can take it . Eddie , just once , say it all . Then we can both forget it . Eddie . Please . Little over ... Over a
zone1	're you opening that now for ? It says , " Open immediately . Organic matter , perishable . " From your friends at the office . - Look at this . - Oh , is n't that nice ? Thank you . Appreciate it . - Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . - I love my present . - What did you expect ? Anything said in your hearing is piped straight to that throne . - Every room you 're in is bugged . - Not true . They call you Finnegan 's fink . - I 'm hired by Mr . Finnegan ... - I know why you 're hired by Mr . Finnegan . He does n't pay me for that . Get your feet off of my desk . Drop you off , Gwen ? Mr . Anderson and I have unfinished business . Merry Christmas . - Bye , boss . - Bye , boss . Merry Christmas . Do men take that crap from you ? Why do you wear those
zone1	a sex thing . Yeah , that 's all it was . Just a sex thing . What do you mean you 're wondering the same ... ? - How much longer ? - " How much longer " what ? - You can take it . I do n't believe that ... - Excuse me . - People who smoke Zephyr cigarettes are safer from cancer . Locking up . You do n't know what 's false and true . You know what will sell . - Are you patronizing me ? - You do n't know what you think . - Are you being moral with me ? You ? - Yes , I know , I 'm nothing . I never was , but you , you could have been ... What ? What ? What you could have been . What happened to you , Eddie ? It must kill you to think what you might have been . Wash him out of your mouth before you get superior with me , you ... What happened , Eddie ? By the way where did you do
zone1	place ? Oh , I forgot . Yeah , I ... I guess her place . What I do n't understand is how come it went on for so long ? Because it did , did n't it ? Oh , on and off . Eddie , remember the time you took a leave from the office went east to research your profile on Chet Collier ? That son of a bitch . - I always suspected that you ... - You suspected right . I took her east with me . My research girl . Oh , God . I wish just once , just once , you 'd said to me : " Let 's go . Come with me and be my research girl . " How did she talk you into that ? I do n't want to know . Good night . That bitch . " Just a sex thing " ? Tell her the truth . Tell her about the months you told me you were gon na leave her . Truth is , I need you both . Then tell her that for
zone1	itself to some unfortunate humor . Did you tell her ? Could n't this morning . Do n't rush me . It 's clean as a breeze - Oh , Eddie . - Smoke refreshed My girlfriend quit this morning . She 's going back to New York . She said to me , " The screwing I 'm getting is not worth the screwing I 'm getting . " So when it gets up to here , instead of a vacation , I take a leave . Pick up a job writing a profile , an interview , something . To keep something going in me . This magazine 's asking me to write a profile of a politician named Chet Collier . Most of the work will be in Connecticut ... - Do n't con me , Eddie . - You could be working for me . A secretary , researcher or ... Gwen , do this one last thing for me and then ... I do n't expect anything from you . Please come . I used to think it was just in the office but you
zone1	change . You 're a liar , Ed . Like most people . But you lie to yourself . - That 's killing you . - " That 's killing you . " - And that 's killing you . - " That 's killing you . " Who the hell were you talking to ? L ... I ca n't sleep . I think I 'll get a drink . Oh , Eddie , you do n't have to pretend you need a drink . Eddie . I 'm gon na tell you the truth . The ... The physical part , that was n't it really . Somehow , by insulting me got me mad she made me look at myself in a way I had n't done for years . That 's why I held onto her the way I did . Finally , when I would n't leave you , she got fed up . What do I have to do to convince you I 'm not your girl anymore ? It was at Collier 's house in Connecticut . That night , we were both
zone1	that thing away , let me interview you for a change ? - What are you , Syrian ? - No . Well , you 're some kind of wog . I 'm a Greek . And what 's your name ? It certainly is n't Evans Arness . That 's my pen name . I started out as a writer and then ... - In the office , I 'm called Eddie Anderson . - What the hell 's your real name ? - Depends on how far back you wan na go . - To when your name meant something . Me , for instance . Collier . Coal miner . Topouzoglou . - How 's that again ? - That 's my name , Evangelos Topouzoglou . Now , that is one hell of a name . We 've been together almost a year . " Give you time " ? She said , " We were together a year . ' Give you time ' ? " Now , you listen to me . Go back to your original name . You never really meant it
zone1	good for me . I knew like you did Finnegan quick , you 'd do me quick . Then what the hell were you stringing me along all those months for ? - Lying to me all those months . - Gwen . Gwen . Okay . Okay . Okay , you 're too good for me , right . Mr . Collier , I 'll be going to bed now . - Is there anything else ? - Let 's go , Gwen . No , thank you , Sheila . Good night . - Good night . - Gwen . I think I 'll stay here . Do you mind ? Welcome . Gwen , we 're leaving . That is for the lady to say . Mr . Collier she came with me and she 's leaving with me . Sit down , Gwen . I walked away and left her with him , like that . Why ? I 've often wondered . Was I glad to be out of it ? I do n't know . The strangest thing happened . All I could think
zone1	... I do n't know what one thing has to do with the other , but I left her there and went back to the city . About 2:00 in the morning , I was in a bar , dead drunk . And for no reason in the world I picked a fight with an absolute stranger . And you do n't wan na make a complaint ? No , officer . I had it coming . Since that night , Florence , I do n't like my life . I do n't like the way we live , this house . I do n't like ... Then change it ! If you do n't like the way we live , then change it ! I 'm not here because I like it here , I 'm here because of you . Goddamn it , Eddie , goddamn it . I mean , Eddie , be just . Be fair . I guess what I do n't like is the person I am .

Come here . Why do you make me do that ? Why did you do that ? I was about to hit her with my fist . Look , darling , Gloria realizes that you 're not exactly rational at the moment .

Leibman . You know what you can do with Dr . Leibman . Thanks a lot , but no , thanks . Baby , you need help and I need your help . - I have n't said anything yet about Ellen . - Changing the subject . She 's in New York . She has n't gone

We have no plans . Have you ? Yes . Florence , I 'm gon na have him live with me . - Eddie , it ... It just would n't work . - Why not ? - Lf you were yourself , you 'd see that . - Obviously , I 'm not myself . - He needs constant care . - I 'll give it to him . Oh , Eddie , let 's face it . He 's a different kind of person than we are . Florence . He 's my father . What the hell is all this sudden pretense that you care about him ? - You 'd like to kill him . - Dr .

Well , ask her . Oh , by the way , I just spoke to Gloria on the phone and she said that they 've found a very nice home for Mr . Arness . No , Father . Old folks ' homes are for people who have nobody . He has me . I remember day I arrived this country . I was 19 . Beautiful boy . Can you believe it ? First time I saw shore . - Dr .

Did you expect to find me waiting here , my tail on ice , with your ... - I expected what I got . - Let me tell you what you got . After you dropped me at Chet 's , I made up my mind to clean you out of me . The next night I went to Downey 's . A guy said , " Have a drink . " - I said , " You 're in luck . " - And ? To finish you off , I called up Jack Schnee . -

A movie producer : Fat , pig rich , arrogant . An old man with a nothing body . But he 'd look at me and he 'd smile that soft Italian smile and he 'd hold me with those soft Italian hands . Like the hands of one of those old saints . No poetry about love but such affection . The purest , the most honest , the most believable thing ... - I do n't care .

Evangelos , why you make me beg like this in front of stranger ? This is my last chance . Everybody laughing at me . Everybody says , " He 's finished . - Sam 's finished . No brains .

They 're coming to get you , Eddie . - Edward . - The Marines . Edward , since I 've come 3000 miles solely for the purpose of talking to you I do n't think I should be required to do so through a screen . Edward . Edward , I 've come all the way from California to chat with you . And I 'm going to chat with you . Edward , you look terrible . What are you doing to yourself ? This is not you . Something has taken possession of you , Edward . Come on now , snap out of it . What ? I ca
zone1	Applesauce . - Damn fool . - Had it all . You did . Edward . I 'm gon na have to protect you and yours , Florence in particular from whatever demon is at work inside of you . And if extreme measures are necessary ... And at this point I think they may be . - I will most certainly take them . You are causing havoc on all sides . You start by kidnapping a man who does n't know which end 's up . - Evangelos . - Where is he ? My father . For reasons that are obvious , I 'm not prepared to tell you . - He 's my goddamn father . - He 's in excellent care . - Where ? - Where he ought to be . In a home for the aged and incompetent . Evangelos . - " Incompetent . " - Yes , Edward . I 'm sorry , but you 've got to be made to face the facts . Goddamn it , Edward , pay attention to me . If you do n't like the
zone1	be just , Eddie . Time is short , Edward , but this marriage can still be made to work . That is what I consider to be my duty as your family lawyer . Darling , if I did n't see you through this , what would I be for ? What would I be for ? Will you stop wandering and listen ? Forget the property involved , although it 's considerable . But Florence , Edward , Florence . You 're married , you damn fool , to the perfect woman . There is n't a man I know who does n't envy you . How many women , I ask you , would have endured what Florence has endured ? Maybe Florence should n't have . Some instinct tells her that this marriage can still be made to work even though she 's in a state of shock and ... Oh , hell . Oh , Eddie , I know it 's going to be good again like it was in the beginning . - I have faith in that . - Faithless ! Incidentally ,
zone1	I really am . Are you preparing a divorce action ? That will not be necessary , providing you do precisely as I say . You never meant it when you said you 'd leave your wife . And that is ... ? First , I want you , for your own deepest good to go away somewhere for a long , long rest . In a home for the incompetent ? Somewhere . I 'll overlook the sarcasm . Somewhere so that you can regain your balance reconstitute your sense of values . - And so that Florence , well , can recover . - Are you in love with my wife ? I beg your pardon ? I hit on something , did n't I ? I must try to remember that you are in a paranoid state . But I will say this : Florence is an extraordinary woman who is being slaughtered by an ego run wild . Since you wo n't believe me , I suggest you ask Ellen who drove out here with me ... - He 's right , Daddy . Mommy .
zone1	Excuse me . Dr . Leibman , Eddie 's here . Should I stay out a little longer ? No , no , of course not , come in . Come in . Well , if it is n't my old playmate . Well , if it is n't my old playmate . I smell money . I smell money . Whenever I see a psychoanalyst and a lawyer , I smell money but this time , I smell it all around me . Florence , may I ask you to explain that remark ? Dr . Leibman , please . I have an appointment . - Well , I 'm going back on the 6:00 plane . - I got a date with a manicurist downstairs . I can fix it up for you too . She 's a little hairy here and there but ... - Edward , Edward . - I need a quick consultation . Can we have a quick consultation , doctor ? Are you in love with my wife too ? Well , she is attractive . You 're so cute . I love

Pay attention , please . - Arthur , do something . - All right . - Thank you . - Just ... Let 's settle back . I smell money . Oh , I can still smell money . Am I getting warmer ? Is this what it 's all about ? " Community property : Both houses , all land , art objects automobiles , furniture , effects ... " You forgot the contents of the Deepfreeze . " ... to my wife Florence until I am , in her judgment , again a responsible person . " " Her judgment " ? Oh , well , give me a pen . Who are you ? What 's the difference ? Eddie , do n't . Do n't sign it . I have no objections . There you are . I always knew your heart would ...
zone1	you can all get the hell out of here , I 'm gon na talk to my wife . You 're right . Now , we 'll all sit down . Afraid I 'm getting a headache . Well , how are you , Florence ? I have trouble sleeping in this awful city . Yeah , it 's been tough on you . But how are you really ? Well , I ... I 've been feeling ashamed . Because ... Because ... I do n't know . Suddenly , it 's like I was persecuting you . You 're doing what you have to do . Eddie , can I ask you again ? Is all this about her ? Not really , no . I 'm prettier than she is . Yes . You are . Then what ... ? What is it about ? My self-respect . That 's all ? That 's all . I mean ... You know , I mean , I thought perhaps it was something ... - Serious ? - I did n't say that . I ought to slap you
zone1	that what you 've been doing ... That . Increases your self-respect ? I was ... I was going to say that perhaps it ... It was something I could n't help you with . The night after you left I was at a party . And I went home with another man . And when he touched me I went dry . Eddie , you 're all I 've ever wanted . I 'm waiting for you . I know you finally kicked her out . She left me . I do n't believe any woman would leave you , Eddie . She 's marrying Charles . Any minute . Oh , Eddie . Eddie , I can make you happier than any woman , if you 'll only let me . And I ... I know that all this , somehow , somewhere , is my fault too . Do n't think I do n't . You know , you look very well . You 've absolutely no business looking so well , you bastard , but you do . Come . Come with me . Lie with

How it should be , so that you 'll be happy . And that 's the way , so help me God , it 's going to be . Oh , Florence . - All I want is ... - Yes . Go on . To do absolutely ... nothing . Fine . What are you going to do ? Just be . Well , what will you be ? Nothing . Be . But be what ? - Be nothing ? - Yes . - Eddie , you 're a talented man , you can ... - Yes . Nothing . Just be myself . Sounds silly . - No , no , not at all . - You know , walk places . You know . Sit down , think . - Maybe . - Like Tolstoy ?

And sell our place in the desert . Sell the cars , the paintings that Bulgarian statue in the garden . Sell the books , the records , Deepfreeze , everything . I 'm head of the house . That 's an order . Sell it . Yes , but , Eddie , be sensible . Where would we go ? What do we really need ? We 'll get a small apartment and start from scratch . Eddie , you 've worked hard all your life , you deserve a comfortable living . But I was n't comfortable . I kept trying to kill myself . Florence , look , I know I 've ... I 've done bad things to you , Ellen , other people but nothing like what I 've done to myself . I did n't say that you were

I 've got to learn to be selfish . That was never your trouble , Eddie . Not that . - Not being ... Not being selfish . - Yes , yes , yes , that 's it . I 've got to learn to be selfish . Our whole life was built around you , Eddie . Oh , the minutes . The minutes . - The minutes . - What minutes ? The minutes of my life . Do you want me to sell them again ? - Eddie , calm down . - I do n't feel calm . Why should I calm ? I swear to God ! I 'll never again ... I 'm never again gon na work at a job I despise . Never . - Never . - Yes , yes , yes . But what are you going to do ? I wan na do ...

And do n't call her a tramp . I 'll call her what she is . He signed my signature to this . Call her whatever you like . She 's less of a tramp than most of our friends . When you tell me about your great new life , I know what that means . - What do you know about Gwen ? - Everything , Arthur 's had her investigated . - Investigated ? - Yes . We know who she 's been with . Do you want the report ? - Investigated , huh ? - How many times and where . I 'm in better shape than you are . I can teach ... - Bought , paid for . - So what ? She would n't prepare commitment papers behind her husband 's back . I did n't do that .
zone1	mental institution . - I did n't agree to that . - There 's a paper in her lawyer 's pocket that would put me in a mental institution on a writ signed by you ! - I refused to sign that ! - But you are ! At this very instant you are considering whether you should sign it , are n't you ? - Are n't you ? Are n't you ? - Daddy ! - Admit it ! Now , admit it ! - Daddy , do n't ! - Admit it ! Are n't you ? Admit it ! - Help ! Help ! Arthur , help me ! - Admit it ! - Arthur ! - Arthur ! - You admit it ! - Arthur ! Help ! - Daddy ! Arthur ! - Liar ! Liar ! - Help ! Arthur , he 's insane . Perhaps Your Honor 's judgment might be that this man should be allowed to benefit from psychopatholo ... The reason she thinks that perhaps Your Honor 's judgment might be that this man should benefit from psychopathological treatment
zone1	the damage that he 's done , not to others , but to himself . I have been able to piece together what Mr . Arness did the rest of that day that brought him to this mental hospital in the condition that he 's now in . It took considerable investigation . Excuse me . I thought I might put the results before Your Honor . Hold on . Do you have any objections , Mr . Arness ? Do you ? As a way of starting . Mr . Arness , do you object ? Mr . Arness , would you remember , I 'm here to protect you not to prosecute you . You may proceed . Our first information came from some children who were playing in front of the old family home on Long Island Sound . They saw Mr . Arness drive up in a cab walk into the old place and pull down the shades . We must bear in mind , Your Honor , as we consider the events that this man has twice tried to destroy himself . In fact ,
zone1	regret it . You 'll regret it . Go ahead . None of us will ever know , of course what went on in the private hell that is the soul of this man . All we know is what his nearest neighbor told us . That at about 9:00 that night he heard an explosion . And when he went to the window , he saw the old place in flames . He called the fire department , rushed over and found Mr . Arness inside the burning house throwing the furniture , curtains , anything he could find into the blaze , feeding it . How Mr . Arness got out , or where he went , no one could imagine . I might add , however , that stored in the cellar of the old place were the commercial records , files , ledgers , correspondence in fact , the entire history of his father 's business life . When that old gentleman heard about it , he broke down and wept . His whole life . What ? That was his whole life . And this
zone1	, perhaps you would take over . We were expecting him to come to the hospital to visit his father so when I was told that he was downstairs in a cab , I was n't surprised . But I did n't expect to find him unconscious in a pool of blood , his own . - Take me to Room 612 . - Take him to Emergency . - And who did he say shot him ? - Would n't say then or later . Whoever shot him escaped without a clue . Mr . Arness lodged no complaint . Mr . Arness . It 'd help me no end to make this decision I 've got to make about your future if you would tell me exactly what you 're thinking this instant . I sat there , I watched those flames and I felt better than I 've felt in a long time . You know . You lit them . And that 's why I came here . I wanted to thank you for that . No one else to thank . Fortunately , both shots
zone1	areas . And though painful , the wounds ... Charles . I only came here to say thanks . Do n't , Charles . I like you , Charles . I like you too . I wan na stay here . He was railroaded . You 've got him in prison here . There are days I wish I could get as mad as you , but it 's not allowed here . I suggest you go see ... - Judge Morris ? - Yes ? Well , Dr . Lloyd tells me you gave him a great going over this morning . It 's a case of revenge , pure and simple . His wife and her lawyer ... May I ask just who you are ? - Are you his ... ? - I 'm ... How do they say it ? Just a good friend . I 'm sure that 's just what he needs . I 'm sure she did n't mean that the way it sounded . Our problem is n't how to keep them in , it 's how to get them to leave
zone1	They even have a turned-off rabbi out there . Yeah , it 's a place where ... Well , somebody called it " a human dumping ground . " But I kind of resent that . It 's more of an escape hatch , you might say , from what 's outside . It 's a hiding place for the unwanted . The last stop . That 's why so many of them do their level damnedest to stay in . Take our Mr . Arness , for instance . Apparently , or so they tell me , he 's so happy he has n't felt the need to address himself to anyone for two weeks . You know he can walk out of that place the minute he has a job and a roof over his head . He 's not so inclined . Not in the least . Nice baby . Nice baby . Come on , get up . We 're going . Do n't give me that silent treatment , Eddie . Come on , get up . They said that if you had a job
zone1	you could leave this place . I have a job for you , Eddie . What kind of employment , may I ask ? Gwen , these are my friends . Well , that 's up to him . Madam , that 's hardly worth leaving here for . Well , when these old people break a hip so they ca n't walk , they ca n't stand the chance of pneumonia is ... Well , like your father . Before you know it ... Hi , Pop . - Do n't . Don't . - Oh , but I 'm going to . - Time to go to bed . - I mean , do n't stop . Do n't ever stop . Okay , girls , come on , come on . So give your family Hollingshead Gravies : Better than the kind Mother used to make and quicker . The sense of touch ... Evangelos . Evangelos ... I 'm here , Pop . Taxi here ? I 'm ready . You know , he looked ... Not my father , just a frightened man who wants

But with you , no . It just seems a complete waste of money and a waste of time . And it 's a waste of time talking to you now . - You 're not listening , are you ? - Yes , sir . You 're not ! Crossland , you 're not listening , are you ? - l am , sir . - None of you are listening ! Look at that glazed expression on your faces . You never listen ! Yours is the generation that never listens ! Cos we can
zone1	, with all your music , and your gear . But , you know , it 's superficial . It 's a sheen . There 's nothing solid or worthwhile underneath . And why do I know this ? Why do I know there 's been no advance in discipline or decency , or morals or manners ? Why do I know it ? Because I still have to use this to you boys every day . Why ? In the ' 20s and ' 30s , I could understand it . They were hard times , but they produced qualities in people that you lot will never have . I can be stopped in the street by someone I taught then . We 'll talk about the old days , and we 'll laugh about the thrashings I gave him . But what do I get from you lot ? A honk from a greasy , pimply-faced youth sitting at the wheel of a big second-hand car . I do n't know . I just do n't know . No guts ! No backbone ! Nothing to commend you
zone1	so , until someone produces a better solution , I 'll continue to use this cane , knowing fully well that you 'll be back for it time and time and time again . You smokers will go out of here with your hands ringing . Will it stop you smoking ? You 're already looking forward to smoking at break . - What are you grinning about ? - Not grinning ' . You are ! I 'll bet you 're already thinking about smoking at break . Empty your pockets . I bet they 're loaded with cigarettes . Come on , all of you , empty your pockets . - Please , sir ... - Quiet . Empty your pockets . - You do n't understand . - Empty your pockets . Disgusting ! Please , sir . You again ? You again ? ! - Yes , sir . - Empty your pockets . - But , sir , I 've got a message from Mrs ... - Empty your pockets ! I do n't believe it . I do n't believe this . Empty your
zone1	told ! Come on , lad . Ah ! A regular little cigarette factory , are n't you ? Yes , sir . Put that rubbish away ! Now I hope it 's going to be a lesson to you . I do n't suppose for one minute it will be . I do n't doubt before the end of the week you 'll be back in here again for exactly the same crime , smoking . Perhaps , once in a while , it might sink in . - Yes , sir . - That you 're wasting your money , that it 's your money you 're burning , and it 's your hands that get caned when you come in here . Good morning . Entry of the gladiators . Where have you been ? - Been to see Mr Gryce , sir . - For the stick ? - Yes , sir . - How many ? - Two . - Did it hurt ? - Not bad . - Right . Hope it did n't . Go on , sit down . Right now ,
zone1	. Do n't give me a fact . You know , do n't say that Guthrie 's got a tatty head or anything like that . ( Anne ) A fact is something where you find evidence out , like truth . Something that you know has actually happened . This is a fact . All right ? Have you got that clear ? - ( all ) Yes , sir . - All right . Tibbut , sit up straight . And I want the rest of yer to look at him - if you can bear it - and tell me some facts about Tibbut . - Wolstenholme ? - He 's always tryin ' to go wi ' t'lasses . - ls he ? - ( laughter ) - He smokes . - Do I heck ! - Tha does . - Get knotted , Guthrie ! I 'm not interested in what he does out of school hours , as long as he does n't come into the class smokin ' a fag . All right ? Come on , you people who are n't thinking
zone1	of an incident that 's happened to you sometime in the past , that is true , and that you think will interest the rest of the class . All right ? Well , er ... I went to this all-night party yesterday . And , er ... about three o'clock , we were dancin ' int ' garden - me and her and all the rest , ca n't mention names - and , er , this woman come across from t'road , and , er , she tells us to ... to make less noise , or she 'd fetch t'police . So , well ... so we said , let her fetch ' em if she wanted . So she fetched ' em . Things that have actually happened . How about another one ? What about you , Casper ? - Casper ! - What , sir ? " What , sir ? " You 'd know if you 'd been listening . What have we just been talking about ? - Stories , sir ? - What kind of stories ? - You have n't
zone1	of it . Some of it ? ! Stand up ! You 're gon na tell us a story about yourself . - l do n't know any , sir . - Well , you stand there till yer do . Always somebody , is n't there , eh ? Somebody who wants to be awkward . Just wo n't be interested , does n't matter what you do . Just like you , Casper . Come on . I 'll give you two minutes to think of something , or the whole class comes back at four o'clock . - Come on , do n't stand there like a nail . - He is a nail . Come on . - l say ... tell him . - ( boy ) Tell him about the hawk , Casper . If anybody else calls out , it 'll be the last call they make ! - Speed ? - He 's got this hawk . He 's mad over it . He just goes wi ' t'hawk all t'time . He 's crackers over it . - Better than thee
zone1	down . Now , come on , tell us about this hawk . Where 'd you get it from ? - l found it , sir . - Where ? - int ' woods . - Where d' you keep it ? - ln a shed . - What do you feed it on ? Beef . Mice . Birds . Is n't it cruel to keep it in a shed ? Would n't it be happier flying free ? I do n't keep it int ' shed all the time , sir . I fly it every day . - Does n't it fly away ? - Course it do n't fly away . I 've trained it . Are you gon na tell us about it ? How do you train a hawk ? You have to be right careful wi ' ' em , sir , right patient . You 've got to feed ' em when they 're hungry . You can only do owt at feedin ' time , sir . - Yeah ? - Got these jesses on , sir , all t'time .
zone1	How do you spell that ? - J-e ... All right . Come out here . You 'd better show us on the board . " Jesses " . That 's a new word to me . Hands up those who 've heard of jesses before ? Nobody . Go on , write it up there . Right . Now tell us what it is . They 're leather straps , sir . And they attach to t'bird 's feet . Say I 've got t'bird on me hand . Straps come down there . Then there 's t'swivel . " Swivel " . Write that on the board . - Then you 've got your leash . - " Leash " . On the board . ( Billy ) I fed it on me hand first . Then , when it got to know me , I fed it on me glove . And after a while , I put it two inches away from its claws . And , er ... Like that , right ? It started to jump for t'meat . When it started to jump
zone1	hand up , so we can see . - l could move me hand away , like , to four inches and six inches . And when it were doin ' that , I started it wi ' t'leash . Do they need water ? When you 've got a budgie , you put water in the cage . Do they need water like that ? Well , it , like , has a bath . lt has a bath right early on int ' morning , like . When do yer feed it ? How many times a day ? To start off with , three or four , to get it plump . - You make it sound very exciting . - lt is . Most exciting thing was when I flew her free first time . - Do you wan na hear about that ? - Yes , sir . Aye . Come on . Well , I 'd been using t'creance for about a week , and it had been goin ' 30 or 40 yards . And it says when birds are goin ' 30-40
zone1	time that it can start to fly free . Well , I 'd been ... I 'd been wantin ' to fly it free , but I dare n't . I were frightened it 'd fly off or somethin ' . This had been goin ' on for four or five days . And I keep on to missen , sayin ' that " Fly it free next day . " Anyway , I got right mad wi ' missen . I says " Right , I 'm flyin ' it free tomorrow . " Anyway , that night - that Friday night it were - l did n't feed her up , so that she 'd be sharp set next mornin ' . And I went to bed that night , Friday night , and I did n't get an hour 's sleep at all . I were frightened about t'bird , that she 'd fly off or summat like that . Anyway , when t'mornin ' came , I kept on sayin ' to missen " lf she flies off , she flies off , and it ca
zone1	and let her hop onto t'post . There were nowt stopping ' her , she could fly off . All that were on her were jesses . I thought " She must fly off . She 's forced to fly off . " But she did n't . She just stood there . I were terrified . She was stood there , and I walked off into t'field , and she were lookin ' round , and when I got about 70 yards from her , in middle of t'field , I called her . " Kes . Kes . Come on , Kes . Come on , then . " Nowt happened . So I thought " l 'd better walk back and pick her up . " So while I were walkin ' back , I saw her flying ' . She came like a bomb ! About a yard off t'floor , like lightning , head still , and you could n't hear t'wings . There were n't a sound from t'wings . And straight onto t'glove . Wham ! And she grabbed me for t'meat .
zone1	n't know what to do . So I thought I better do it again , just to prove it were n't luck . So I took her back onto t'post , and walked up into t'middle of t'field , and called her again . And she came just as good as first time , straight onto t'glove , grabbing ' for t'meat . Well , that were it , sir . I 'd trained her , sir , and that were all I could do . I think you 've done enough . Well done , Billy . Big hand of applause . ( applause ) - Got owt , Casper ? - Nay . Tha never has . Tha just cadges . Casper the Cadger , they ought to call thee . - l would n't give thee owt if I had . - l 'll give thee summat . What tha goin ' for ? Do n't tha like company ? They say thi mother does .

You 'd say I was a bully , would n't yer ? And you 'd be right . Cos I 'm bigger and stronger than you , are n't I ? Eh ? - l 'll fetch me dad . - Oh , yes . And I 'll fetch mine . My dad 's heavyweight champion of the world , so what will your dad do then , eh ? That 's what it 's like to be bullied . You do n't like it , do yer ? You 'll like it a bit less if I ever catch you at it again . Do you understand it ? Yes , sir . Get it shovelled up . Come here a minute . Have you been smoking ? - No , sir . - You have !

They all seem to pick on you . Why is it ? - Do n't know . - ls it because you 're a bad ' un ? Maybe I am sometimes , but I 'm not that bad , sir . I know stacks of other kids that 's worse than me , but they seem to get away wi ' it . Why else do you think , eh ? There must be some reason . Well , take this mornin ' , sir . I came in and just dozed off . I were n't doin ' nowt wrong . I 'd been up since six . I had to do t'papers , then I had to rush home to look at t'bird , and then run to school . You 'd be tired , would n't yer ,
zone1	be caned for that , sir . And you ca n't tell Mr Gryce that . And this little lad , sir . He 'd only brought a letter from a teacher , and he got t'cane . It 's nowt to laugh at , sir . Afterwards , he was sick as a dog . And teachers , sir . They 're not bothered about us , sir . If we 're 4C , they think we 're numbskulls , owt like that , sir . They 're always lookin ' at their watches , to see how long there 's left of t'lesson . They 're not bothered about us , and we 're not bothered about them . How are things at home these days ? All right , sir . Usual , I suppose . - Been in trouble with the police recently ? - No , sir . Not since I 've been without MacDowall 's gang . You know , they used to go into t'city and go into t'coffee bars and t'cinema , but since I 've been without them I 've been

Lookin ' forward to that , are yer ? Eh ? Have you got a job ? No , sir . I 've got to see t'employment bloke . - What sort of job do you want ? - Anything 'll do me . But you want something that you 're interested in , do n't you ? - l 'll take what I 've got . - l thought you wanted to leave school . - Not bothered . - Thought you did n't like school . I do n't , but it du n't mean to say I 'll like work . Still , I 'll get paid for not likin ' it . - That 's one thing . - l suppose it is . I might be able to save up and buy a goshawk .

zone1	. Come on , then . You know , there 's something weird about it when it 's flyin ' . - Hawks are t'best fliers there is . - No , I did n't mean that . When it 's flyin ' , there 's something about it makes you feel strange . - ls it cos everything ' goes quiet ? - That 's it , aye . Other folks have noticed that . I know a farmer who says it 's same wi ' owls . You know , when they get his mice in his yard at night . When they swoop down , he feels like poking ' his ears to make ' em pop . Cos it goes that quiet . It 's as if they 're flying in a pocket of silence . Have you noticed how quietly we 're speaking ? As if we 're frightened to raise our voices , a bit like shouting in church . - lt 's cos they 're nervous . - Oh , no . lt 's more than that . It 's instinctive . lt
zone1	. That 's what makes me mad . When I take her for walks , somebody says " Look , it 's Billy Casper and his pet hawk . " I could shout at ' em , sir . lt i n't a pet . Or if somebody comes up to me and says " ls it tame ? " is it heck tame ! Hawks ca n't be tamed . They 're manned . lt 's wild and it 's fierce and it 's not bothered about anybody . Not bothered about me , right . That 's what makes it great . A lot of people would n't understand . They like their pets to be fussed . I 'm not bothered about that . I just want her for her looks and to fly her . They can keep their talkin ' budgies . They 're nowt compared wi ' her . You 're right , Billy . You 're probably right . D' you know summat , sir ?

Anton is a doctor , not a farmer . - And so now I 'm the maid . - Be reasonable , Emmie . Change the sheets Do the laundry Scrub the floors ... It 's no use . Emmie will never agree to sell the farm . If I could have gotten the cash two years ago we would be in the city now . I 'm a good doctor . I was before I came out here . - What you mean is , before you married me . - That 's not it . Oh ! Salem ! But , how did you ... you know ... I thought ... I 've been thinking about you , Britt . I 've been thinking about you for a long time . Dr . Jenks . Britt ? She 's what ? Oh no , Mr . Torens , come on , come on . Well , I 'll be right over . -
zone1	. Mrs . Torens ? Do you mind stepping out while I examine her ? Well , what was it ? She was strangled . Strangled ? But why ? Why would anyone want to kill our Britt ? Ca n't have been dead very long . Well , we 'd better take care of your wife . And then let the police know . What are all those ties for ? I do n't know . I just do n't know . Somebody been fooling with your bag ? Emmie 's been telling me to get my ties cleaned , and damned if I do n't keep forgetting ! That woman ! She always have to have her way , eh . - Ah , Inspector . - Find anything ? Strangulation . - Manual ? - No . These regular contusions rule out bare hands . A stocking , soft cord , or something like that , I 'd say . - Was she assaulted ? - No . - Did she put up a fight ? - Hard to say . She was a strong girl .
zone1	she 's been using . One of the popular brands . Oil of peppermint . - Ah , menthol in fact . - That 's it . Very funny ! A very funny trick ! - What are you talking about ? - These ! Why put them in my bag ? I do n't know what you 're talking about . Maybe Emmie does . Emmie ! Emmie , dear ! So you do n't know anything about my instruments ? You did n't take them out of my bag and stick these in their place ? I did not ! Are you insane ? No . But I 'm sure that someone in this house is trying to make it look that way ! Emmie ! Em ... ! So it 's Emmie . It 's Emmie , is n't it ? She 's found out . How could she ? She 's acted strangely for a long time . She watching . Everything ! Every move ! She keeps bringing up Salem . Salem this ! Salem that ! Salem ! Salem ! Salem ! Anton ,
zone1	know and even if she did she could n't do anything about it . Oh , she could . Anton , a drunken farmhand was found killed in the yard ! Salem was found guilty . The police were satisfied then and no story of Emmie 's is going to change that . - The parrot could change that . - The parrot ? The parrot saw it all and he heard you . What if he said , " Hit him , Anton ! Hit him , Anton ! " No one pays attention to what a parrot says . Emmie would pay good attention to that and make sure that the police did , too ! No , Emmie ca n't hurt us now . Oh yes , she could and she will try . Why take my instruments ? What use has she for the morphine ? - Morphine ? - Yes . Three ampoules of morphine taken out of my bag , enough to kill a man ! And a hypodermic . That 's easy to find out . We 'll ask her . If she
zone1	! Oh ! Emmie ? It 's your paperweight . Yes . Ester ! ... Ester ! Ester ! Ester ! Get me the police ! Ester ! Open the door . Ester ! Ester ! Open the door ! Hit him , Anton ! Hit him ! Hit him ! - I knew it ! - Hit him Anton ! I knew you would say it ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Go ! I 'll get you . Ester ! Ester ! Ester ! Ester ! Es ... ! Anton ? Anton ? - Anton , what 's the matter ? - Do n't ! Listen it was Salem ! Salem killed Emmie ! He did n't touch you ? Did n't hurt you ? Where has he gone ? - Come . Sit down . Sit down here . - Here ? - He killed Emmie . He killed Emmie . - It 's no use Anton . Look at this room . You did it . - You 've completely lost your mind ! - No , listen to me . Salem was in this
zone1	! Ester , Salem got back into the asylum ! - He got back in ! - What else did you expect ? But if he can get out of such a place , why then go back ? Salem was here ? You saw him ? You 'd better stick to that little story , it 's your only defense . Defense , what do you mean ? I do n't need to defend myself . Do n't ... do n't you understand what I 'm saying , Salem was in this house and he killed Emmie . Come in , come in please . It 's it 's Emmie , my sister in law . - Where is she ? - She 's up here , in her room . We found her together . My wife , Mrs . Jenks . She went down to phone . Then I saw Salem hiding in the cupboard , almost naked . Right here is where he was standing when I saw him . Quite mad , quite mad , to kill an innocent woman . Uh , did you
zone1	. I saw she was dead and - We did n't think it wise to touch anything Hit with considerable violence . No motive . Has to be a maniac . It must have been a great shock to you both to discover her like that . Yes , of course . And Salem was hiding in this cupboard , you say ? Yes . Door please . This is my wife 's bedroom . This is my study . - Would you mind ? - No , no , no , of course , go ahead . Ah , the famous ties ! The famous , er ... Oh , no , no . I see , Torens has told you about them . So many things have happened that I quite forgot to mention that . My bag was rifled and a handful of ties stuffed inside . Would you explain that as the action of a sane man ? They look clean enough to me . I 'm sorry , clean ? Oh no , no , you misunderstood . Inspector , I had to invent the
zone1	everything was so embarrassing - I understand , ties in a medical bag , - it is embarrassing . - Yes . Well , I 've seen enough . - Let 's find my assistant and we 'll be off . - All right . Ester , the Inspector 's leaving now . I wo n't trouble you anymore tonight . Of course , that business of the ties reminds me . It 's the morphine and the hypodermic that 's important ! My instruments ! - What happened to them ? - Stolen . Stolen out of my bag ! What could he have done with them ? Never mind . We 'll check that . Try to find them . The police doctor and the ambulance will be here in a minute . Goodnight , Mrs . Jenks . Try and get some rest . Thank you Inspector , good night . I think I handled that rather well . You talk too much ! What 's that , sir ? One of Dr . Jenks ' ties . Menthol ! Uh-huh . It checks out . Traces
zone1	neck . Uh-huh . No fingerprints . This material does n't take any the lab said . Uh ... Excuse me , sir , I ca n't understand why you did n't arrest the doctor ? He is our man , it 's as clear as a bell . You 're quite sure of that , are n't you Carl ? Yes . Well , yes . Obviously the tie is the murder weapon . Well does n't it all point to Dr . Jenks ? Yes , it does . Yes . Very clearly . The strangest thing of all is his story about Salem suddenly turning up in the middle of the night and killing his own sister . I had the attendants at the asylum check and of course Salem had n't gotten out . On top of that getting back in again and neatly locking himself in his cell . Now why would the doctor tell such a crazy story ? Yes , why ? Well , it does n't make sense . Perhaps it makes , perhaps it makes a little too much sense .
zone1	strangulation , weapon silk tie . Belongs to Dr . Jenks . Second case . Crushed skull , heavy paper weight . Belongs to Dr . Jenks . Prime suspect , Dr . Jenks . To neat . To obvious . Motives unknown . Possibility , work of a maniac . Maybe . Maybe . But who is the maniac ? Thank you for taking the time , Dr . Kemp . No trouble , but I warn you , it 's quite a walk . Get out ? Why yes , very simple . If he could fly . Do you think Inspector anybody could get down these walls ? But one of them broke out about ten years ago ? That was n't a break , Inspector . It was suicide . That is the Occupational Therapy room . It keeps our patients busy . Salem is the tall one in the middle . He did all this ? Yes , in therapy . A lot of imagination . Just like Jack and the beanstalk up there . Dr . Kemp , how could Salem get out of
zone1	get around to that . Well , it 's quite simple really . First he 'd have to unlock this door . But as you can see the lock is on the outside only . Well , what about this letter box arrangement ? That is for trays in case they 're confined . But look , the panel opens from the outside . You could n't reach through it to the lock even if it were open and you 're going to have to have a key to begin with . I see . Let 's assume the door 's left open . I do n't like careless assumptions . Let us not base our hypothesis on my negligence . I 've got to build on someone 's carelessness , so whether you like it or not , I 'm going to say you slipped up last night . I 'm going to have that door open . Now , where would Salem go ? Simple . He comes out into this corridor and this is where he stops ! Stay here . This is Doctor Kemp here .
zone1	Please close the doors for a moment . Thank you . It 's the same on every wing and every floor . Nine o'clock we lock up . Any empty cells . Cells he might get into and then force a window ? I 'm sorry . We 've got a full house . And stop giving Salem the whole bunch of keys . I 'll give you his door open . - But I wo n't grant he 's got round Pop ! - Pop ? Night floor attendant , this wing . That 's his office . - Right . - How 's that ? - So Pop is bribed ! - Yes . All right . He 's very friendly with Salem . They do play chess together . Let us go so far as to say Pop 's even opened the door for him . Now Pop has done all he can do ! He ca n't even open the gates . Salem 's on his own . Remember , it is almost a hundred feet to the courtyard below . A visitor for you ,
zone1	. But do n't into a game of chess with him . You 'll never escape ! You 're from the police , are n't you ? I know why you 've come . You 're in the awkward position of trying to get information from a lunatic . I 'm here to talk to you just the same . With an eye toward reconsidering my confinement here ? Possibly . I like it here . I 'm safe ... - From whom ? - Myself . Would you care for a game of chess ? I do n't play . What do you mean , yourself ? If I were outside I 'd kill people . My sister , Ester and her husband . - And how many others ? - No others . Oh , Emmie was always kind to me and generous . She use to send me home made scones and things . I 'm sorry she had to find out . Find out what ? Are you sure you do n't play chess ? Quite sure and I have n't got all evening , either
zone1	Emmie found out ? She found out I never did murder that farmhand . - How do you know ? - Well , why else would Jenks kill her ? I 'm not sure he did . Oh , yes you are . You just do n't know why ? What about the girl , Britt Torens ? Conscience is a terrible thing . Why do n't we just stop amusing ourselves and say what 's on our minds ? I 've kept it to myself until now , have n't I ? Britt 's dead . So why bring it up ? I might be able to get you out of here . I said I 'd kill people . There 's no policeman in the world who could stop me . What about Britt ? Miss Torens had a charming disposition , the local parson said . She was very popular among the neighbors . And her father was completely heartbroken . So ? So it would have been cruel of me to destroy her character in public . I 'm not the public . I was with
zone1	- Alone ? - Alone . She could have said that in court and you would have been proved innocent ? Yes , I think that 's the way it might have gone . You 're a liar , Salem ! Of course I am ! There was n't a finer girl around than Britt . I should n't have told you such a thing . But why did n't you tell the court ? Although her father would have disowned her . I did hope that Britt would walk into court and speak up of her own accord . Her failure to do so came as a , well , as a revelation . A letdown . Besides , they 'd found my axe with my finger prints on it , and blood on the blade , and motives and reasons . Did n't I drink too much ? Well , you must know the story , Inspector . I do n't expect you to prove what I 've just said . I do n't expect you to get me out of here either . I only hope it
zone1	understand . You expect me to believe your girlfriend finally got an attack of conscience , went to Jenks and threatened to expose everything . Something like that . Why should she go to Jenks and not the police ? You 're the policeman , Inspector , you tell me . Sorry , did n't know you had a visitor . Oh , that 's all right , Pop . We 'll have plenty of time later . I 'll have a present for you . - Present ? - Yes . Later , then . Just like being back at school ! We know what we 're doing up here . I 've had a long time to wonder about the police . I hope you still hold us in your esteem . We appreciate the patience you 've shown . You should n't be sarcastic . I could kill you with my bare hands and they 'd only put me downstairs . Yes . This is what they do to me when I talk out of turn , Inspector . How does it feel ? How does it
zone1	to hurt you . Do n't struggle . Let me tell you something . I know a good deal of what happened over there last night . We read papers up here , you see . I 've been thinking a lot this morning . So let a madman give you some intelligent advice , Inspector . The next man on Doctor Jenks ' list will undoubtedly be a worthless lawyer by the name of Clemens . Do you know what two years thinking has told me ? Clemens was paid to change my plea . Because Ester and Anton wanted a conviction . But something has gone wrong in that house now , after two years of watching each other . They are afraid . Ester is telling Anton to kill everyone whomight bring the trial into the open again . And by what preposterous evidence do you suppose they will arrange to prove that I have escaped from this place ? Huh ? Well , I do n't know . But you 'll believe whatever it is , and I 'm not worried . But there 's one
zone1	Inspector . Do you really believe that anyone would ever return to this howling prison after once getting out ? I 'd sooner be dead . - May I get up ? - Why certainly . Do me one favor , Inspector , do n't think Anton is insane . I 'm the insane one . You should n't believe a word I 've said . Mr . Clemens anyone at this hour . Will you kindly tell him it 's very urgent . But he 's ill . He 's in bed with a fever . I 'm a police Inspector . It 's extremely important . Oh ... Well , all right . Come in . You can wait in here . In the library . Mrs . Hansen ! Mrs . Hansen ! Who in the devil is ringing the bell at this late hour ? - It 's the police , sir . - Police ? Do you got a search warrant ? No , sir . What gives you the right to nose through my belongings ? Mr . Clemens , have you any reason
zone1	course not ! What kind of balderdash is that ? Is this what you got me out of bed for ? Tell me what you want and get out of here . It has to do with a trial you 're familiar with . The Salem murder case . I believe you changed Salem 's plea from not guilty to guilty by reason of insanity . - Certainly . Certainly , I did . - Why ? Because my first duty is to my client . Because I know the difference between prison for life and experienced medical care in a mental institution . Have you ever visited the asylum ? What has that got to do with it ? Because if you had I do n't think you 'd be drawing such a fine distinction between the two establishments . What are you driving at ? Mr . Clemens , allowing for good behavior what constitutes a life sentence in prison ? Twenty . Twenty-five years . And once a man has been certified criminally insane , how long do they put him away for ? Until the qualified
zone1	Which could mean never . Please tell me by how much did the Jenks ' increase your fee for switching ? Are you implying that I was bribed ? No , I never mentioned the word . But Salem 's sister and the Toren 's girl have been murdered and Dr . Jenks has made accusations against Salem . Why on earth should Jenks ' want to bring up Salem 's name now ? Everybody knows he 's been put away . Because Dr . Jenks is most anxious to convince me that Salem was at his farm last night . Jenks said that ? But why invent a story like that ? I ca n't imagine . But since you had such a close understanding with him two years ago , it occurred to me that you might be able to explain his behavior . How dare you ! Get out ! Get out ! I really came here to warn you to take care of yourself . And I do n't mean your cold . Thank you for the present Salem . It 's very kind of you
zone1	that 's not the strangest set of men I 've ever seen . Salem , do you want to spoil my game ? I ca n't play with all those making faces at me ! Nonsense . Pull up your chair . I 'm going to capture your queen tonight , Pop . No you 're not ! Oh , it 's getting on for nine . I better get closed up and play through the slot . Set them up , while I get my stool ! And it 's my turn with the white ! I do n't know . Do n't go moving your queen prematurely , Salem . I 've warned you about that before . I want to expose her . I know what I 'm doing . Have it your own way ! I did n't see that move ! Then why kick up a fuss ? Because that queen of yours keeps pointing at my knight , that 's why ! I ca n't stand these men ! Salem , I appreciate the trouble you went to , but I just ca n't
zone1	set then ? Well , it 's really to late to go changing but ... I just ca n't play with these . That knight was n't there before ! When we changed boards you ... Pop , you 've got to learn to be a good loser . It 's checkmate in three moves and you know it , regardless of the queen ! Salem , it 's no good ! I 'm not enjoying myself ! Because you 're losing ! It 's to late anyway . It 's lockup time ! Just a moment , Mrs . Hansen . It 's Mister Clemens ! Mrs . Hansen says he 's in a bad way ! Whatever it is , tell them I 'm making no calls until after the funeral . It seems quite urgent . It might be wise ... - You should go . - You 're right . Tell her I 'll be over ! Right away ! He 'll be right over . Yes . Good bye . You 'd better forget that bird . It must have flown away . I just
zone1	! We 'll look for it later , dear . It must be in the attic . Right now I think you should get over to Clemens . All right . The police please . Like a summer night . He 's been coughing like that all day . Clemens , how long have you been like that ? Mrs . Hansen , I want to talk to this man alone ! Get him an extra blanket and turn up the boiler ! This place is as cold as a barn ! Do n't bother with that stuff , doctor . I did n't call you for doctoring ! I 've been going through some very interesting files , doctor . Some of the evidence and testimony has taken on a curious light since the death of Emmie . I believe you 're delirious . In fact , I 'm sure you are ! Yes , I 'm delirious just like the police Inspector . Yes , he was here ! And I want to know what the devil you 've been telling him about me ! What are you
zone1	that farmhand two years ago . That 's what I 'm talking about ! The murder you pinned on Salem ! And now you 've had the unmitigated stupidity to tell the Inspector you saw him in your house ! Why , you fool , who do you think is going to believe that ? - I did see him ! He was there ! - What do you take the Inspector for ? A nincompoop ! You certainly made the Inspector suspect Salem ! He suspects him of having information that 'd send you away for life . He went to the asylum all right . He went there and found out a lot . A lot about you and your wife ! Not about me , Jenks ! Why ? Because I 've got nothing to do with it and never did have ! And now that he 's making you sweat , you 'd better keep your mouth shut about the way I defended Salem ! The fee was not exorbitant , nor was it ... Be quiet now . I 'm going to take your pulse
zone1	Clemens ' is delirious . He 's within an inch of double pneumonia . He 's got to stay in bed . - Will he be all right ? - Yes . He 's recovering from a coughing attack and I 'm going to give him a sedative . - Bring me a glass of water please . - Okay . Thank you . Open your mouth now . You 'll feel better now . - Go away . I do n't want anything . - Now come on . That 's right . He will sleep through the night . You should n't leave the house . - If he gets restless , give me a call . - Thank you . Come with me into the study and I will give you a prescription . And tell you what to do , and also , what I 'd like him to eat during the next few days . Inspector , I 'm so relieved . So terribly relieved ! I was afraid he 'd come back before you came . You mean the doctor 's gone out ?
zone1	. It 's warmer in the kitchen . I sent for you because there 's something wrong with my husband . Something horribly frightening ! I believe he 's insane ! Why do you say that , Mrs . Jenks . He actually believes he saw Salem . And you do n't think he did ? How could he ? And now I 'm afraid he 's going to try to kill me . Here , sit down . Now , why should he try to kill you ? Why should he wish to kill your sister ? There was something about Emmie that no one ever knew . She and Anton , I mean . Please , go on , Mrs . Jenks . Emmie introduced me to Anton . She was always getting him over here . I promise you I had no idea they were planning to use me as soon as I married him Use you ? Are you suggesting there was something wrong with the trial two years ago ? Yes . And what 's more , I do n't think Salem is insane ,
zone1	Emmie and Anton were in this kitchen doing something and that the farmhand came stumbling onto them and they were forced to kill him . I believe they moved the body and put blood on Salem 's axe . That 's a very serious accusation , Mrs . Jenks . Here in this kitchen . Hm . I mean it was scrubbed clean the night the farmhand was murdered . Should n't you have mentioned that at the trial ? It just did n't seem important at the time . I did ask Emmie about it . I remember coming in that morning , seeing the floor all scrubbed and cleaned . Even under this stove . - Was she upset ? - Not at all . She told me she had n't been able to sleep the night before and that she got up to make herself a cup of hot milk , and she could n't stand the sight of the dirty floor . Now I wonder what they could have been up to when a farmhand barges in ? Of course it 's only guesswork and it
zone1	dead case . I do n't think it is dead , Inspector . You see , Emmie and Anton hated Salem . He did n't let them do anything with the property . He did n't care about money and running things efficiently . - And Anton did ? - Certainly ! Salem was never practical . He just sat and drank . And because he was in control all we could do is watch the profits go down the drain . Emmie did n't like it . And believe me I did n't like it either , but Emmie took it to heart . She was a grasping woman . Always arguing with Salem about selling this place while prices were high . Let 's get back to this kitchen . If you ask me , somebody 's been at this floor with a hatchet and it looks burned ! Exactly ! Emmie handled the insurance ! I see ! They intended to start a fire in here , burn the place down and collect ! The farmhand came in , caught them red handed ! So Dr .
zone1	My young friend has a vivid imagination ! But I think he 's right ! What in heaven 's name is that ? That 's the parrot . That 's another thing . Anton 's been trying to kill it . Where is it ? I do n't know . It got out the night Emmie was killed . Anton 's terrified by the bird 's voice . Uh , it might not make a sound for hours . You know he 's looked through ever corner of this house like a lunatic . He even gets up in the middle of the night ... What 's the matter ? That clock does n't work . Has n't for years . The hands are n't even connected . Anton 's back ! He ... he used the front door ! He 's in the house ! Waiting ! He 's been listening ! - He 's going to kill me for talking to you ! - Stop it ! Nobody 's going to kill you . Look around Carl . Well the birds been here all right . It 's
zone1	it moving . - No . No , Anton 's back here . - I know he 's back . - He 's not here . Where did he go ? Where did he go ? The Clemens ' , an hour ago . No ! ... Do n't ! Do n't ! ... No ! Put it down . You can run away . Run , I wo n't tell you 've been here . You 're here , Salem ! Yes , I 'm insane , Ester . I 'm mad ! You made sure of that , did n't you ? No ... I did n't . It was Anton . He did all this to you . I did n't know it before it was too late . It was Anton and Emmie . I know you , Ester . I 've tried to help you all these years , Salem . Tried to get you out of that awful prison . But Anton hates you . I understand that you want to kill him . But to kill Emmie ! That was a terrible thing
zone1	'll help you . You can still run away . Just give me the axe and run . I wo n't tell anyone . I always loved you , you know . Did n't I help you before ? And you love me . You 're my big brother . So ... give it to me . Give it to me . Give it to me , now . Do n't be silly . Do n't you understand , I am trying to help you . Give it to me now , you idiot ! No ! Aaaaah ! Ester ! Ester ! Ester ! Salem ! No ! No ! Please ! Do n't ! Do n't ! Do n't ! No , no , no ! Do n't ! Do n't ! No ! No ! You ca n't ! Please ! Stop it ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! Oh ! Do n't ! Please ! No ! You ca n't ! You ca n't ! The house is empty , sir . No sign of Doctor Jenks . I 've seen them hacked to pieces
zone1	Let them know at the station . Hmm . Inspector ! Inspector ! Is he gone ? - Inspector . - Who are you talking about ? - Salem - Oh , he was here again , was he ? I think he killed Ester because I heard her scream and then I did n't hear her anymore . So I have to be very careful because he can get out . In and out . I think it 's wise to keep all the doors locked . And how do you think he killed Mrs . Jenks ? With the axe , of course . He had to use the axe . - To get even . - To get even . Yes . We put blood on his axe . This time he had to wipe it on me . He came out to kill Ester and now he 's going back to put the blame on me . I wish I had n't listened to Ester . To even think of burning this place down for the money was madness . And then to ... To kill
zone1	! " Hit him , Anton ! Hit him ! " And I Tell the sergeant we 'll be needing statements from Jenks and Torens . What about you ? To the asylum just as fast as I can make it ! Doctor Kemp here . Open up ! - I 'm sorry to give you this trouble . - No trouble , sir . - Can I go in please ? - Certainly . Salem ! Salem come to supper ! Salem ! Salem ! Salem ! Subtitles : mitbrille Karagarga

Do you find her attractive ? Who ? Emily ? Right . Yeah . Hello ? Can you sell me some eggs ? Come on down here and get them . I 'm looking for some place to sell antiques , like lamps and a table . If there was a place , I sure would n't tell

On his neck . - Hello . - Hello . Anything special you 're looking for ? I 'm Sam Dorker . - Hi . - Sam . Hi , Sam . I 'm Duncan . This is my wife , Jessica . - Glad to see you . - Hello . - Are you passing through ? - No , we just moved here . We 're new in town . More refugees from urban blight , eh ? I had a shop up until two years ago in New York on Second Avenue . Where ? Oh , between 52nd and 53rd . We lived on 49th and 3rd . - Oh , really ? - They tore the building down and ... Well , I just could n't take it . They built a pizza parlor next door to me . I just could n't stand the smell
zone1	is fresh and clean . - Oh , yeah . - And the fishing is just great . The man who owned the shop before me lived to be 96 so I expect to be here for some time . Well , what can I show you ? I 've got a marvelous old grandfather clock here , if you 've got room for it . It 's a real steal at $375 . I 'll steal it ! And at the other end of the scale ... Oh , you like that . I was just about to show you that . That 's a male fiori lamp . - Do you understand Italian ? - No . Male fiori , that means flowers of evil . Or evil flowers . And they got it painted right on there . Now , right up here I 've got some marvelous old things , real early Americana . Got a marvelous , old deacon 's bench up here .

zone1	well , lead on , MacDuncan . - What 've you got ? - Well , sir , I 've got a couple of nice jugs , and a chair and a table . And some bottles , a couple lamps , real nice silver frame . Bridle , some other stuff . Flowers of evil . How can anything this pretty be evil ? It 's just old , that 's all . When we have money again , this is the kind of stuff we 're gon na buy for the house . That 's some very nice stuff . Some of it . Some of it . What about this ? It 's silver . Yes , I guess so . Very nice . Very nice piece . But I ... What ? The Bishops . There 's no mistaking the Bishops . Well , we bought the old Bishop place . - Who 'd you deal with , old Harold ? - No , Harold 's gone to Florida . It was an agent that showed me the place . Why ? He tell you the
zone1	that ? It 's quite a story . Sam , how much do you think this stuff 's worth to you ? Well , I ... Let 's see . I can give you $150 for it . And $50 more for this . $200 ? But even some of the little jewelry costs more and you said they were very nice pieces . Well , frankly , I feel very funny about buying them . I think I 'll have some trouble trying to sell them around here . But think what you could get for them in New York , Mr . Dorker . Duncan , could n't we keep this ? $250 is the best I can do . Well , all right . Come on , we 'll take it . You know the story about the Bishops is really extraordinary . Yeah . Abigail never got to wear that wedding dress ... Mr . Dorker . She drowned in the cove behind her house . Your house , I mean . Never found her body . The legend is that she 's still alive .
zone1	. Mr . Dorker , we 're sort of in a hurry . Could we have the money ? Of course . That was very rude , cutting him off . Do n't do it again . You 're making me sick by worrying about me so much . We wo n't be long . I 'll make dinner . Hi , Woody ! Oh gosh , it 's so beautiful . Can we really stay ? We 'll try . Hey , do n't touch that . It 's poison . - What is it ? - It 's a mole . It has no eyes ? Duncan , get a container so we can keep it , please . Okay . I 'll get a box from the house - and I 'll come back for you . - Okay . I 'll be all right . Just hurry before it gets away . Okay . It was the antique dealer . Dead , right here . I swear it , I saw it . Duncan , it 's true . He was lying right here . And
zone1	me but I swear it 's true . And there was a girl . I 'm scared . Is it happening again ? Duncan , that 's her ! Here , who are you ? - Why did you run ? - You see ? Tell him , tell him you led me to the body . Tell him . Who are you ? Why have you been following me ? What do you want ? Do n't push her , Jess . Give her a chance . I 'm not going to hurt you .

Did you see anybody ? Did you ? For God 's sake , Jessica ,
zone1	. You do n't believe there 's anything strange going on . I think it 's ... - It 's all strange . - You think I 'm crazy ? Admit it . Admit it . Who 's that ? There was this enormous cake that was terrorizing England . Angel 's food or devil 's food ? Devil 's food cake . And it would ooze into the windows and into the doors and engulf the people .

You know the name of that big tree out in the yard ? Jessica . That 's a maple . I know how to tell a sugar maple . How ? Well , see , a maple 's sort of pointy in its corners . But a sugar maple has a " u " . It 's a " u " for sugar . That 's you , sugar . Jess ? I think you should go back to New York for a while . You could see your doctor . - Lf you want . - Well , yeah , but

Abigail never got to wear that wedding dress . Drowned in the cove ... I 'm here . I 'm here . I was just looking at the picture . It looks so much like you . My Lord , it does . Gee , how weird . What 's the matter ? Nothing , it 's just that it does , it looks so very much like you . It 's an old print . It could look like anybody . No . No , it 's ... It 's the eyes . You 're so warm . I 'm sorry you 're so upset . Jessica , come , Jessica . My eyes , look in my eyes . Come with me , come . Come with me . It 's so stuffy in here . -
zone1	- Yeah . It 's stuffy . I think you need to swim . You need some air . Yeah , I just do n't want to get too near the cove , you know . - Water kind of frightens me . - Oh , sure . If you do n't want to swim , we could just lie by the water and get some sun . Come on . Come . Follow me , Jessica . Follow me . I 'll put some lotion on your back . That 's good .

zone1	a week . I do n't feel anything . Come on , put your money out . Five , right ? - Five . - You 're on for five . Let 's have a second opinion . Before morning . - It 'll be a week . - You heard me say that . I did n't . Who is the father , anyway ? I do n't know . She 's a slag , this little mutt , she 'd try anything . You drank yourself under the table after your little episode with Janette . Get out . Do n't get upset . We 've all had our little episodes with Janette . What a doll . Better . You need a drink . Oh , no . Water , please . Yabba water 's only for washing . Come on , drink it up . It 's a bit flat . Come and get it . Oh , no , thanks very much , but I do n't ... No , I 'm sure you do n't . But you 'd better eat it just the
zone1	. Not too bad . Kangaroo . Want some sauce ? What time did the , um ... The , uh , party finish ? About dawn . And what time is it now ? ' Round about 4:00 . 4:00 ? Look ... Look , uh , thanks for the hospitality . I 'd better be going along now . You see , I 'm the school teacher at Tiboonda . And , um ... Well , I lost all my money . Gambling . Yeah , I know . Why did you have to lie about it to Tim Hynes ? There 's no disgrace here . Well ... Well , in any case , I ca n't stay in your , um , cabin , indefinitely , can I ? It is n't mine . I 've just lived here for five years . Anyway , you 're better off here than trying to sponge on men like Tim Hynes . Sponge ? Yeah , sponge . Sit down and eat your grub . You 're gon na need it . We 're going hunting with dick
zone1	, you were boasting in your cups , and said ... Good shot . You said you won a silver medal at school for target shooting . Huh ? Remember ? You would n't have an aspirin , would you ? No , I 've got something better . This ought to kill your headache and pep you up a little bit as well . Wash it down with some beer . Here . Oh , I 'm allergic to ... Ah , there 's nothing in there to hurt you . Go on , man , swallow it down . What a voice . She just opens her mouth and ... And notes come floating out . Oh , sorry , I do n't smoke . Would you like to try it ? No . You 've been here five years ? Shall I satisfy your curiosity ? I 'm a doctor of medicine . And a tramp by temperament . I 'm also an alcoholic . My disease prevented me from practicing in Sydney , but out here it 's scarcely noticeable . Certainly does n't stop people
zone1	because I 'm not interested in money . Anyway , I 'm unreliable . But I 'm accepted socially because I 'm an educated man . Or character . I get my food from my friends . My requirements in beer . Which , with some measure of self-control , is the only alcohol I allow myself . And you get along without money altogether . It 's possible to live forever in the yabba without money . As you probably noticed , some of the natives are very ... Hospitable . Take Janette for instance . Now there 's a very interesting biological case . If she were a man , she 'd be in jail for rape . If I were to marry , Janette 's just the sort of girl ... Excuse me . Uh , can you tell me where the , um ... Toilet ? Yes . Outside . I would n't recommend it . Do it out here in the open . No one around to see . If I were ever to marry , Janette 's the sort of girl I 'd like
zone1	and she likes variety . We thought about getting married once , but neither of us could live with one person for very long . Still , she visits me from time to time . When I want her . And when she gets bored with them . Beer ? What 's wrong with a woman taking a man because she feels like it ? I really do n't know . Because there 's nothing wrong with it . Sex is just like eating . It 's a thing you do because you have to . Not ' cause you want to , but most people are afraid of it . You seem offended by my little discussion of Janette . In the circumstances , I thought you 'd be interested . Well , I 'm not . You 're probably a little puritan , like the rest of these people . They think Janette 's a slut . The women who 'd like to act like her and the men she has given a tumble to . Janette and I are alike . We break the rules . But
zone1	, doc ! Doc ! Come on ! Make a bit of noise , boys , will you ? Hi , dick . - Hey , Joe . - In the back , fellas . Get back there . Hey , John . I got a gun here for you .

Nobody who 's broke buys beers in the yabba . I 'm not broke , I 've got a dollar . Forget it , John , forget it . - $1 . - Look . When you got some money , you can take us on a bash . - Right ? - Right . - Stubbsy ? - Yeah . Four more and four double whiskeys . Right . And a packet of smokes for the teacher . Three whiskeys , dick . - Four . - Three . - Four . - Three . - Four . - Three . Four . Hey , you got her fair , eh , doc ? Hey , Joe , take a look at this . It 's a beauty . Yeah .

All right ! Yippee , Joey boy ! Come and get your beer , fella ! Once you 've got her by the tail , it 's as good as dead . Have you ever done it , Joe ? - Dick ? - Eh ? - Have you ever done it ? - What ? Oh , yeah , hundreds of times . Yeah , of course he 's done it . I 've done it ! Why ? Do you want to have a go , teacher ? Why not ? If I were you

Go get him . He 's trying to dance with him . Come on . Cut him through . Johnny ! The throat ! He 's trying to beat the thing to death . Through the throat , teacher . Come on , Johnny ! You beauty ! Well done . Yeah , that 's it , Johnny , now you 're one of us . You bloody maniacs . Bloody maniacs . I can not accept your premise , Socrates . Affectability ? Progress ? A vanity spawned by fear . A vanity spawned by fear . The aim of what you call civilization is a man in a smoking jacket , whiskey and cider , pressing a button of ... A button to destroy a planet a billion Miles away , kill a billion people he 's never
zone1	happened ? Hey , what happened to Socrates ? Where 's Socrates ? - What ? - Socrates ! You bastard . No , Joe ! Stop it , you ... You murdering bastards . You bastards ! Beat it , doc . You murdering bastards ! Bastard ! You are ... I 'll get you . Okay , you old hippie , get out ! What 's up ? Oh , Stubbsy , you bastard . It 's only a party . Bloody maniacs . What do you want with me , doc ? Bloody cow ... You bloody coward ! Whoa ! Get off . I need to ... Refrigeration . Doc . Turn it off , turn it off . No . No , no ... Going ? - Yes . - Where ? Sydney . Sydney . You want some food before you go ? No . How about a drink ? Hey , do n't forget your gun . What ? The boys made you a present of the gun . Bye . Better ? Yes , better . Thanks , mate . Have another

I thought you were pulling out of the yabba on Saturday . Hmm ? Oh , yes , yes , I was . What went wrong ? Oh , I got involved . Hey , there 's my suitcases . Yours , are they ? Yes . I left them here yesterday . No . No , not yesterday . No , it 's the other day . They 've been here since Saturday . Look , if John says they 're his , then they 're his . What 's in them , John ? Oh , it 's clothes . Books . Couple of schooners , Joyce . Like he said , books . Not that I doubted you , of course , John . Is there anywhere I can get a shower and shave ? Thanks , mate . Right , thanks a lot . - Come and have a
zone1	Come and have a drink . - Not interested ... It will only take a minute . Come on , come and have a drink . Look , mate , I 've given up drinking for a while . What 's wrong with you , you bastard ? Why do n't you come and drink with me ? I just brought you 50 Miles eating dust , and you wo n't drink with me . What 's wrong with you ? What 's the matter with you people , huh ? You sponge on you ... You burn your house down , murder your wife , rape your child , that 's all right . But do n't have a drink with you , do n't have a flaming , bloody drink with you , that 's a criminal offense , that 's the end of the bloody world . You 're mad , you bastard . Hey . The gent here wants to know who owns that semi-trailer . Who wants to know ? Excuse me . You , uh ... You own the semi-trailer ? What of it
zone1	see if you could give me a lift . Where you going ? Right through . To the city , I mean . Well , I 'm going to the city myself . - Oh . - How much is it worth ? I am afraid I 'm broke , that 's why I 'm begging rides . Should be worth at least a couple of dollars . Well , it would be , yes , but ... But I 'm really flat . Make it $2 and we 're sweet . Look , I 've got $1 . I ... I 've got a rifle . I 'll give you that . What sort of rifle ? All right , you ride in the back . Okay . Thanks . Hey , you , we 're there . There ? You know ... I thought you said you were going to Sydney . Do n't know why . You said city , mate . Bundanyabba 's a city , ai n't it ? Well , at least the trip cost you nothing . Hey ! I , uh ,
zone1	tire you , I thought I 'd write down what had happened and you could sign it , okay ? " The gunshot wound to my head was the result of an accident . " I was visiting my friend , Clarence F . Tydon , after a hunting trip . " I dropped my .22 rifle at the floor of his kitchen butt first , " believing it to be unloaded . " It exploded , and that 's all I remember . " That 'll be about it , would n't it ? Here . You 'd think a bloke who 'd won a silver medal at target shooting could hit himself in the head at a range of three inches . Give me that . Do n't wan na miss it . Hey , mate . - You like a beer ? - Oh . Thanks . Here 's cheers . Hello , Charlie . Did you have a good holiday ? The best .
zone1	37855 - Up yours ! - Get out of the way ! Fine time piece , brother ? Goodbye . " Who 's the black private dick that 's a sex machine to all the chicks ? " Shaft " Damn right " Who is the man that would risk his neck for his brother man ? " Shaft " Can you dig it ? " Who 's the cat that wo n't cop out when there 's danger all about ? " Shaft " Right on " They say this cat is a bad mother " Shut your mouth " I 'm talking about Shaft " Then we can dig it " He 's a complicated man " No one understands him " But his woman " John Shaft " What 's happening , Marty ? Same old sixes and sevens , Shaft . Two guys were looking for you like 10 minutes ago . Harlem cats ? How the hell should I know ? Everybody looks the same to me . Take it easy , Marty . Take care , Shaft . Thanks , brother . Too much sugar this morning . Then do n't drink it ,
zone1	you . Know them ? Not by name . Seen them around uptown . Come in here when I was opening up . Asked where they could find you . What did they look like ? One was wearing a funky plaid coat . Other one was sharp . $50 shoes . Black coat , gray flares . - Is that all ? - They had heat on them . The one in the plaid coat had his hands in his pocket . Pulled his coat tight , you dig ? Had some heavy iron in his belt . You got a scuff on the toe of this left shoe . What time you got , Tom ? 8:16 . Pull over in front of that shoe-shine parlor . He usually hangs out there . Okay . - You want me to go in ? - No . We 'll wait . Got yourself a nice shine . You can go out and make something of yourself , man . Go out and get rich and fat like you ? We 're straight , baby . Got a minute ,
zone1	Vic . Get off my back . I just want to talk to you . Call me up . You know my number . Come on , I 'll buy you a cup of coffee . Go sit in the park a minute ? Hell , no . Just tell me what you got to say right here ! Tom , go get us two cigars . What kind do you smoke ? Just say what you 've got to say . Get us a couple of El Garcia 's . Look , I 'm late . What are you trying to lay on me ? Just love , Shaft . Nothing but love and sympathy . Then we 're even . Go on , get on with it . I thought you might know something I want to know . Seems there 's been a lot of low , quiet rumbles going on uptown . Our people have been able to pick up the sounds of it , but not words . That 's ' cause us black folk talk mush mouth , Lieutenant . I thought we 'd
zone1	want me to pigeon . I just said , " Up yours , baby . " How come two cats from Harlem came downtown this morning looking for John Shaft ? They 're soul brothers . They came down so I could teach them the handshake . They find you ? Of course , I was n't hiding . If you find out anything , give me a call . I 'm still at the 38th Precinct . Right on . Where the hell are you going ? To get laid . Where the hell are you going ? That boy 's got a lot of mouth on him . The boy 's man enough to back it up , too . What did he tell you ? Nothing . Got to lean on that kind . You do n't lean on that kind . Give me a package of gum . Make a noise , I 'll cut you . Back up . - Something wrong , Mr . Shaft ? - Sick friend here . Jim , can you get us a car up ? I 'll take
zone1	is your partner ? Open the door . You 've got about a half a minute to tell me what the hell you want with me . The police will ask why you threw that son of a bitch out the window . They can find you dead or alive . Now , what 's your goddamn story ? Bumpy ... Bumpy says to bring you uptown . Did he tell you to mess me up ? I was to bring you . It does n't make sense . You arrive at your office . You have a sick friend with you . Suddenly , another man you do n't know rushes up and a fight starts . Your sick friend goes out the window . Why , Mr . Shaft ? Ask the man who started the fight , Mr . Leibowitz . Your friend , the only name you know him by is " Tex " ? - No last name ? - That 's right . I do n't buy that , Shaft . I think you know more than that . Why the fight started ,
zone1	prove are two different bags . All your friends walk around with weapons like that ? That depends . My Negro friends do n't walk around with rabbits ' feet no more . Do n't get wise with me . There 's a simple way for me to go . - I 'll put your goddamn ass in ! - I 'll sue your goddamn ass for false arrest . You want me to believe the man fell out the way you said he did ? - What do I look like ? Some kind of klutz ? - Do n't ask , and I wo n't tell you . You 're licensed by the city and the state . No one licensed can afford to be a wise ass where a felony case is involved . Are you suggesting I 'd lose my license ? You are damn right I am ! You better believe it and level with me ! Threatening my livelihood is a violation of my rights , is n't it ? Byron ... Let me have a talk with him in private . You got
zone1	join after we talk . I think you are b.s . - ing me , too . This thing stinks . Maybe he did n't like the handshake you taught him . You know you can get your rump in a sling for this mess ? - Static , a lot of hassle . - You 'll save me , Vic . Well , I can try . If ? One hand washes the other . All the hassle in the world would n't make me sing a song to the police . No way , baby . That cat you threw out the window was a flunky for Bumpy Jonas . I did n't throw no cat out no window , Lieutenant . Bumpy is n't gon na like it . I do n't care what he likes ! What the hell are you pumping me for ? Two weeks ago we started picking up rumbles . - You already said that . - We know it 's not the Panthers . Or the Young Lords . But , something 's on the boil . I want to know
zone1	count the bodies . Bumpy wants you for something . He knows what 's going on . And that 's what I want to know . Not who , just what . It warms my black heart to see you so concerned about us minority folks . Come on , Shaft . What is it with this black shit ? You ai n't so black . And you ai n't so white , baby . All right . You want to play your super heavy black number . I 'm gon na play mine . We can nail your tail for manslaughter with what we 've got on you right now ! You can waltz Leibowitz , but you know the law . You could be charged . Charged , Lieutenant . Yeah , but your license 'll be suspended . You 'll be out of business for six months . You want to be out of business for six months ? Out on the street . No gun permit . Six months ! With Bumpy looking for you when all hell 's about to break loose ? You want
zone1	death , Lieutenant . You 're buying trouble not only for yourself , but a blood bath up in Harlem . You want that ? All I 'm asking you is to let me know what 's going on ! No names , no places , just what ! I 'm not asking you to sell out . Tell me the name of the game , so I know the rules . I 'll think about it . All right , I 'll settle for that now . That buys you 48 hours on the street , and then we 're gon na talk again . You got the number of Bumpy 's private phone ? All right . Take off . I 'll see to Leibowitz . Right on . I 'll see you . Look at that . - Wrong number . - Do n't bull me , I got the right number . This is Shaft . How did you get this number ? Off a bathroom wall in the goddamn subway . I 'm looking for you . I 've got an office . Here you
zone1	Cold as hell today , huh ? Yeah , yeah . Good chestnuts . How much ? Two bits . - Here you go . Take it easy . - Thanks . Hey , taxi ! What the hell is this ? You white mother ! Taxi ! Taxi ! Cat say he gon na be here , he should be here . Open it up . Cat say he gon na be here and he ai n't . It ai n't right , Boss . We 'll wait . You take crap off of him he 'll give you more crap . We 'll wait . That 's some cold shit throwing my man , Leroy , out the window . Just picked my man up , and threw him out the goddamned window . Got us standing around and waiting to say thank you . Glad you let yourself in , Bumpy . Give me a bad name , have you hanging around in the hall . If the man ever comes down here again to see you you make sure you be here . Waiting . You
zone1	Leroy tried to muscle you , Shaft ? Well , I got no grudge about Leroy . I could n't give a damn . I got a job for you . I 'm not on the hustle , Bumpy . A detective job . - What kind ? - Your kind . You take it . Do n't jive me . What are you talking about ? Somebody kidnapped my daughter , Marcy . Done in a couple of people . Did n't leave no ransom note or nothing . Nobody saw nothing . I want you to find her . That 's the fucking job . The police do that for free . Not for me . You know I ca n't go to the cops . And you want me ? The spade detective . Yeah , I want you ' cause you 're a black spade detective . I want you ' cause you got your other foot in whitey 's trough ! She can be anywhere . Got any idea who grabbed her ? A lot of cats hate my guts . A sweet , loving
zone1	as you beat her man out of his paycheck in the back room of a horse parlor ? Feeding his kid shit to shoot in his arm ? Who could hate you , Bumpy ? My baby never sold nothing to nobody . Never took nothing from nobody . She 's a straight kid . She 's going to college . Whoever grabbed her , got her to get at me . They have a beef with me , they should come to me . So you got a rule that somebody else do n't . Is that all you know ? There 's a piece of Harlem I ca n't get at . The one them militants got their arm on . They could have my baby . She 's been into some of that stuff . Bunch calls themselves the " La Mumba 's . " Ben Buford 's thing . I could send my people to ask them . Shit . It 'd come to a shootout and when it 's all over , a bunch of dead cats . And maybe they 'd kill Marcy .
zone1	want to see you burn as bad as they want to see the police burn . But kidnapping sisters , that ai n't their thing . The only reason anybody grabs anybody for is money . What other bunch in Harlem needs money bad enough to grab my baby ? If you believe that , what 's all this about me having a foot in whitey 's trough ? I said I think they had her . I did n't say they had her in Harlem . They ai n't dumb enough to take her someplace uptown . It do n't lay right . What the hell you think I need you for if I knew who had her ? I 'm guessing . If they do n't have her , all right . Maybe they know something . I got nothing . That 's the job , Shaft . Will you take it , or no ? I get $50 an hour . Plus expenses . And no questions asked about how I spend it . You got it . I get a free hand to move any way
zone1	all I want . I got money . You spend it . And you find her . That 'll get you started . When will I hear from you ? When I got something to say . One more thing : You send another cat after me with a gun , I 'll kill him and I 'll come looking for you ! And I 'll get you , Bumpy . You believe it . Fake mother . " Black man born free " You seen Ben Buford around ? " The way it 's supposed to be " Chains that bind him are hard to see " Unless you take this walk with me " The place where he lives " It 's got plenty of names ' Slums " ' Ben Buford used to live here . He live here anymore ? No , why ? I 'm looking for him . I am , too . He owes me six months ' rent . Take it easy . " Any kind of job is hard to find " And that means an increase in the welfare line
zone1	hungry , what would you do ? " Rent is two months past due " And the building is falling apart " Little boy who needs a pair of shoes " Hello , ma'am . I 'm looking for a guy named Ben Buford . You know him ? Yeah , I know him . - Seen him around here lately ? - Not in a long while . " Some of the brothers got plenty of cash " Chicks on the corner gon na see to that " Some like to smoke , some like to blow " Some even strung out on a $50 jones " Some are trying to ditch reality " By getting so , so high " Only to find out that you can never touch the sky " I 'm looking for Ben Buford . You seen him around ? No , I ai n't seen him . Thanks . Know what the number was today ? " Every Sunday morning " I can hear the old sisters say " Hallelujah , hallelujah " Trust in the Lord " He 'll make a way
zone1	Cause deep in their souls they believe " Someday he 'll put an end " To all this misery - " That 's in - Soulsville " Soulsville " - What 's happening ? - Man , how 's it going ? Seen Ben ? Ben ? Ben who ? Ben Buford . You know who I mean . Look , man , I do n't know no Ben Buford . $20 . That Ben Buford . He 's holed up on a place on Amsterdam , 710 . What apartment and what time ? Third floor . There 's a meeting at 9:00 . I ca n't guarantee it . I just heard some cat tell another cat . They 're both in the movement with Ben . Yeah , well , stay loose , baby . You all right ? Baby , are you all right ? I got to feeling like a machine . That 's no way to feel . Come here , baby . Had a visitor from uptown this afternoon . What 're you having ? A dog with mustard and onions . No
zone1	, John , what did you get ? I got laid . Uptown , brother . Amsterdam Avenue . Take your time . I 'm early . Champ , you lost ? No . You live around here ? Yeah . You look cold . Get something to eat . Gee , thanks , mister . Okay , champ . - Who is it ? - John Shaft , Ben . Unless you want more visitors , better split up that pair out front . Put somebody on the basement door . How did you find me ? Was n't hard . You got a big mouth . - Cool it , man . - You cool it , boy . Do n't let your mouth get your ass in trouble . - I got nothing to say to you . - Do n't jive me . - We 've put in a lot of street time together . - That was a long time back . I do n't know you no more . A lot of hard years , man . The kind you do n't forget .
zone1	to say what you came here to say . Then you go back out that door you came in or I 'll throw you out . You know Marcy Jonas ? - Yeah , why ? - You know where she is ? - What do you mean ? - Somebody grabbed her . Bumpy thinks maybe it was you . We do n't do that kind of thing . You know anything about it ? Tom , you used up your minute . Get out ! Do n't " Tom " me , man ! - Where are the guns ? - None here . I 'll be goddamned ! Sonny ! Sonny ! They 're coming ! - Up on the roof ? - Yeah . Go ! He 's dead . Come on , come on ! Not the roof , this way ! Stand back . - What is this ? - Everything will be fine . - What is this ? - Go over there and be quiet . Everything 's okay , ma'am . No need to worry . Sorry about your door .
zone1	up , man ! Young man , please . Do n't do that . Do n't ever threaten me again ! And do n't call me Judas ! Come on . It 's no time to count your dead . Come on ! Look . Come on ! This way , this way ! One of yours ? - No . - Probably a finger man . When you lead that revolution , whitey better be standing still ' cause you do n't run worth a damn no more ! We 're done running , man . What the hell do you call this , man ? I got to find out if they 're after you or me . I 'll leave you with some friends . They 're straight people . So do n't you lay any of that Uncle Tom jive on them . I do n't know what 's connected to what . I ca n't piece them together . Answer that . It 's only a half an hour since it happened . How could I have something this soon ? I 'm not paid
zone1	thinks ! It 's Shaft . You want to talk to him ? I got a call . I might have something . Hold on . No , better I call you back . I 'm coming to see you . You 've been holding out on me . I 'll wait . Listen , several cats were killed in Harlem . You know anything about it ? I was there , Lieutenant . The Captain 's at home . Call him back . Tell him I left to chase down a lead . - Where are you going ? - Nowhere . Just get him off my back . A reporter from the News wants an interview . Tell him to call the Captain . Serves the old bastard right . This is that list from the intelligence section . What about the pictures ? They 're getting them together now . Said about five minutes . Shaft 's coming down . Send him right in . Dina 'll get you a bed made up . Why do n't you get some sleep , man ? Got some dead
zone1	I should be . Till we find out why they 're dead , this is the only place for you to be ! You think like a white man ! You do n't think ! You want to get wasted ? If that 's what it takes ! Marvin 's sleeping . I 'll find out what I can and pick you up in the morning . If you think I 'll owe you for this , you 're wrong . You got nothing I want ! You can have the girls ' room . I got to go out . Got an extra key so I do n't wake you when I come back ? This 'll open the downstairs door , too . Watch your mouth . I 'll say anything I want . Not in this house . Not here , you wo n't . Have a chair . I do n't like your chair . You gave me nothing , Vic . You want to lock me up for manslaughter ' cause someone went out of my window go ahead . You got no deal .
zone1	That 's straight . What do you got now ? One question first . Anyone who could 've identified those guys with machine guns got wiped out ! Yeah ? Five of Ben Buford 's people and probably the guy that fingered you . Me ? Are you sure it 's me ? I 'd be sure if I knew if the guys were black or white . I 'd make it 80-20 they were after you . But Bumpy could probably tell you that for sure . Just say what you got , man . A few things that may fit . Do you remember I told you that Bumpy was doubling his crews up in Harlem ? So ? So , downtown we get some visitors . Three guys from LA , two from Phoenix , a guy from Decatur , Illinois four guys from Philly . Altogether about 15 that we 're sure of . Special guys , huh ? All suspected being guns for the Mafia . Just got into town . Most of them staying at a hotel in the Village . Taking in the
zone1	more . A couple of dudes from Harlem go across to Jersey . Try to kidnap some Mafia bigwig . They blew it . They killed the guy 's runner . But the man says his runner was in Florida on a fishing trip . - Looks like war coming . - It 's a bad thing . Mafia against Bumpy . It 's hood against hood , on the inside . On the outside , it 's black against white . We could have tanks and troops on Broadway if this thing breaks open . Yeah , you got a point . This is what some of our visitors look like . Be a good time for it . What ? War ? Fishing down in Florida . It might help if I knew what Bumpy hired you for . - Never said he did . - He did . It 's against my ethics to say yes or no . - He put you on the spot , Shaft . - He did ? You 're a very wise Caucasian , Vic . I 'll be here .
zone1	That 's a comfort . - Hello ? - Hello , baby . I waited up . - Sorry , I ca n't make it . - Got problems ? Yeah , I got a couple of them . I was born black and I was born poor . I love you . Yeah , I know . Take it easy . Get up . We 've got a man to see . See who that is , will you ? It 's Shaft . Let him in . - I have an appointment with Bumpy . - I know all about it . I 've got to see if you 're clean before you can see the man . Better get yourself six more helpers then . That 's how it 's done . Who searches you ? Nobody . Then get the same cat to search us . I 've got to see if you got a gun on you before you go in . Tell Bumpy we were here . Come on , Ben . You gon na let them walk now , Willy ? Bumpy 'll
zone1	in to the man . What do you want , Willy ? - Shaft 's out here with some dude . - Send them in . He wo n't let me see if they are clean . Let them in . Go on , you heard him . Listen , Snow White we 're gon na tangle sooner or later . Did you hear what I said ? Why do n't you stop playing with yourself ? You ai n't gon na do shit ! You 're a cagey spook , Bumpy . You ride a tall horse , Mr . Shaft . This is Ben Buford . Your little caper cost him five friends last night . - We 'll take it out of your ass , pimp . - You 're pushing me a little far . I found out some things , Bumpy . You knew who grabbed your daughter , and that it was n't Ben or his people when you laid all that jive on me in my office . I told you , there was no note . I still do n't know who
zone1	, deal them up straight , or do n't deal them at all ! You grabbed the dope hustle up here from the Mafia . Made yourself some big bread . Now the Mafia wants to move in on you . So what ? So , the Mafia grabbed your daughter . You knew it . You knew it when you hired me . Yeah . You tried to snatch one for a trade . But your flunky friends out there blew it . They burned some kid . Missed the man we wanted to grab for a trade . Then you wanted to hustle old Shaft . I hired you for a job . I conned you , but I never lied to you . My baby was grabbed . You 'll get her back . You bought that deal . You 're gon na live with it . Not at these prices , baby . I told you what it costs , it costs . A lot of hyped-up black people give you that money you 're spending , pimp ! Do n't you try to bullshit me
zone1	I sell broads and dope and numbers . You sell crap and blue sky . It 's all the same game . You knew the Mafia cats would come after me , did n't you ? But it does n't shake me up . They made a good move to take out my front man . They 'll probably try again . I would . You been using me , Bumpy . Suckered me . That 's okay . We stood face to face . But , I want to know why you wanted me to hook up with Ben . ' Cause you 're gon na need an army to get my baby back . Ben 's got one . My people ai n't worth a damn outside of Harlem . If you think I 'd risk some of the brothers just ' cause your daughter 's black , you 're wrong , man . We need money . I got a lot of brothers and sisters in jail . Set a price . $10,000 a head . That 's what the honky government pays a cat in the
zone1	our price . All right . You telling me you 're willing to lay out that kind of bread for Marcy ? Do n't jive me , man . I can always get more money . I only got one baby . That means you already owe him $50,000 for the men he lost last night . All right . We can get a lot of brothers and sisters out of jail with that . How many of his you 'll need ? Depends on whether the Mafia will take a ransom . - They want Harlem , nothing less . - It ai n't yours to give . Not anymore . Mine or not , it 's not gon na be theirs . All I got ta do is find out where they 've got her and bring her home . That 's it . If he 's worth $10,000 , I 'm worth $20,000 . You got it , COD . Half now , half when I bring her home . All ! Right now ! Half , that 's the best I 'll do . You just
zone1	I 'll have my boys drop it off . At these prices , you blow it , Shaft , I 'm not gon na like it . Not even a little bit . I thought the money did n't matter to you . Just getting your baby back . Money always matters . This is where I get off , man . One thing we got to get straight . If it comes to a fight , we do it my way . For that kind of bread , the brothers 'll play . As long as you remember we owe them five . I said , my way ! I 'll call you . - Hey , man ! - Hey , Billy ? Come here . - Do me a favor . - Sure . - Go up to my place and turn on the ... - Hey , no , man . I 've already turned on . No , Billy , turn on the lights .

Detroit people . - Will you turn them loose ? - I have no choice . They 'll leave town . You 'll have strangers looking for you , not them . Can I have a private talk with them ?

No phone calls and no letters from her . I 've got to see her . Then maybe he 'll deal . Nothing I want to say in this rat hole . - People might be listening . - That 's a risk we 'll have to take .

She 's our ace . You never give up your ace . Maybe you 're right . I should take you uptown and turn you over to Bumpy . Change your mind , you can walk right now . You try to take the girl or me along , you 're dead . You trying to tell me they 'd blow you away to get me ? That 's right . I halfway believe you . But , you 're my ace , so I got to call you .

Hey , everybody out . Quick . I 'll kill this guinea bastard , so help me God . Open up ! Open up ! Get me out of here . I want solitary . - First you let go of that man , Valachi . - Like hell .

You do n't like our cooking ? Maybe you think

You telling me it 's easier to talk to my lawyer than it is to Don Vito ? 36849 , you have a visitor . 36849 , you have a visitor . Valachi ! Drop that pipe ! Valachi ! Drop that pipe ! Valachi ! At least I got Salerto . Joseph Saupp , you mean . You hit the wrong guy , Valachi . Saupp 's a check forger from Alabama . No connection whatsoever with your people . I 'm telling you , Salerto tried to kill me . A dope charge and now a homicide . You do n't give me protection , there 's gon na be more . You let an animal talk like that ? No wonder we 've got trouble in our prisons . - Who the hell you calling an animal ? - You got
zone1	in insane asylums two others killed in a gunfight with police . Screw you . I do n't need nobody else climbing on my back and leave my family out of it . Hear me ? I hear . You got me real scared . Who the hell are you ? - Ryan , federal board . - Oh , big deal . - I seen you someplace ? I know you ? - I know you . - So you wan na dance ? - I wan na talk . - I ai n't a talker . - Like to bet ? Did you hear what happened to your friend Tony Bender ? - Who ? - Tony Bender . He 's an underboss of Vito Genovese , that 's who . He 's disappeared . You call lost and found yet ? Word is out . - Rat . - Vito , what happened ? Vinny was there at the dockside . Joe Valachi , Tony Bender . Salerto caught a slug . He was dropped , but I hear he is doing fine . The only two
zone1	They rats . An open contract . No price . Anybody sees them , they can have them . Vito Genovese . Nice voice . Mickey Mouse . Wan na hear the punch line ? Genovese thinks you set them up to get busted . Bullshit . I 'm the only guy can save your life now but I 'm gon na wan na know about Genovese , his drug operation . Why do n't you ask your friend ? He knows a model prisoner when he sees one . Okay . Warden , it looks like we got ourselves another short-sighted mobbed-up punk . I told you . Take him back to the can , and not solitary anymore . If he meets up with a knife on the way send him a dozen roses with my compliments . - You wan na tell me something ? - Yeah . Screw you . Come on , Valachi . - Where you taking me ? - You 've been asking enough . This time he 's ready to see you . - Genovese ? - Mr . Genovese . Mr

That Tony , guys like him , they ca n't take the time . Between ourselves , Joseph , I think he talked . What do you mean ? What does it matter ? He disappeared . Hell , Tony was a sick guy . To have to take orders from a sick guy like that , Joseph can be a very bad experience . So who gives him the orders , huh ? Listen Bender promised me a deal for five years . I pulled 15 . Now they 're gon na give me life . - Bender was wrong . All I know is he tells me about some narcotics job and suddenly , there 's cops all over the place . Vinny 's arrested , Frank 's arrested , Salerto . Then I find out you 're arrested . I figure ,
zone1	" That 's what I 'm asking you , Joe . All this time , I do n't know anything . Nothing . After my 30 days in quarantine , I enter the population and he tries to take me . I say I got ta see you . Once I see the right man maybe I 'll know what the hell 's going on around here . And because you 're the only one who can put a stop to them . Joe sometimes I have a barrel of apples and one of these apples stinks so it has to be removed , or it stinks up the rest of the apples . If I done something wrong , Don Vito , show it to me and leave me the pills . I 'll take them in front of you . Who said you did anything wrong ? Joe , how many kids you got ? One . How many you got ? Six . That 's a good thing to know . You just made up my mind , Don Vito Genovese . Twenty thousand dollars for Joe
zone1	my protection , huh ? Hell , no . It 's for mine . All right , you guys , keep moving . Come on , do n't stand around . - Jeez . - Break it up ! You know the rules . I ai n't stood like this and looked out a window in months . That 's very expensive , Valachi . It 'll cost you all you know . For a start , take a look through these mug shots . What the hell 's the hurry ? I want this over . The sooner the better . Place and date of birth . Shit . Place and date of birth . Born in New York September 22 , 1903 . School ? - I went to the seventh grade . - After seventh grade ? Hey , what the hell is this , some who 's who kind of bullshit ? I thought we were gon na get Genovese . Talk , Valachi . After the seventh grade , I worked on a sandboat for one of your potato breaths . The O'Brien Brothers ,
zone1	, wop . You ever finish school ? Yeah , did n't you ? Where ? Sing Sing . My name 's Tony Bender . That 's my bed , those are my things . Be polite . Introduce yourself . My name is Joe Valachi . - You happen to know Joe the Boss ? - Joe the what ? You 've never heard of Joe Masseria ? Do n't lie to me , Valachi . I hate a liar . I never saw him before . Okay . The Gap looks after you . Tony Bender is a strong arm for Mr . Maranzano . We got ta be careful you 're not a Masseria man . No , I do n't know what the hell all this crazy war talk is about . In my gang , the gang I got , everybody 's pals . Joe the Boss has been moving in on Maranzano . Nice pal . Some Mustache Pete from the old country . Sometime I 'm gon na tell you about my outfit . Very big , huh ? You got a lot
zone1	seven guys . They call us the Minutemen because it only takes us a minute to pull a job and it takes the cops two minutes , maybe more , to show . And what do you do ? You go out and throw milk cans at windows ? Bender 's boss has 400 guys in his gang . Most of them torpedoes . And that Mustache Pete you were talking about let 's see , he 's got 600 . As the paper says , there 's a war on . Guys from Sicily , guys from Naples . Anytime you wan na mob up , ask for the Gap , Paradise Restaurant . Times change , Joey , and awful fast . The Gap was sure right . Times were changing . One week out of Sing Sing , I got a tip on a silk factory in Brooklyn . I pick up a couple Irish guys to fill in part of my gang that 's been arrested and away we go . All right , lady , let 's have your dough . And your watch .
zone1	take you out on a job , and you act like a couple of pigs ! Stupid bastard . Son of a bitch . You know , the police had radios . Could cut my time in less than a minute . Out a week and already in trouble ? - I 'm on the run . - I got eyes . Come on . - What 's all this ? - I met that guy in Sing Sing . - Who is he ? - A friend of Gap 's . Who is he ? A friend of Gap 's . They met him in Sing Sing . Why he is wet ? Mr . Maranzano wants to know why he 's wet . I do n't know why he 's wet . - Why 's he wet , Gap ? - I do n't know . He do n't know why he 's wet . You gentlemen are looking for something ? Sorry to disturb you , Mr . Maranzano but did you seen a man come in here dripping wet ? He had horns like this ?
zone1	He tried to rob a silk shop . We chased him a couple blocks . Racked up one of our cars . Ditched his in the river and got away . I sincerely regret I have not met with such a man . - Well , if you do . - What you think ? I give him a job . Good night , officer . Good night , sir . The first contract I worked on was to hit a guy named Steve Ferringo . He was one of the lieutenants who worked for Joe the Boss . Ferringo ? We were on to him . At least five killings . Bender got me to rent an apartment same place where Ferringo lived on Pelham Parkway . One month 's rent under a different name . There 's Ferringo 's apartment , right across the courtyard . First floor opposite . Like I said , I got a tip-off he moved in there last week . - Make some coffee , will you , Gap ? - Sure . I 'll make coffee , spaghetti , meatballs , anything
zone1	You look musical . You think so , huh ? Oh , Buster why do n't you go take a look and see if the view 's right from there . - That 's no problem . - Buster from Chicago . Go easy with him . To date , nine killings . Oh , yeah ? Still looks musical to me . Okay , Tony , this one 's gon na be easy . Hey , none of my business but I rent this apartment . If he shoots him from there they trace it to me . Now , everybody 's seen me . The neighbors , the doorman . Okay . We 'll use this place as a stakeout and hit him from somewhere else . Staircase , window , corridor , anyplace . So ? Come on , Joe . You go upstairs the corridor outside Ferringo 's apartment . And give us the sign when they come in . - You got those pictures ? - Yeah . Here 's a little homework to memorize . Joe Masseria and family . I never knew anybody
zone1	as far west as Chicago with Capone . And how in hell Maranzano ever expected to destroy Joe the Boss that was beyond me . Hold it ! - What floor you want ? - Punch yours . Holy smokes . Holy smokes . Guess what . - What 's wrong ? - I just saw that guy , Masseria and these other two . These other two . Luciano and Genovese ? Oh , it 's not possible . - Yeah . Yeah ! - No , not possible . - No , impossible . - They got on the elevator . I pretended I was going to the third floor , they went to the sixth . Come and take a look . They pretended to go to the sixth . Full house . Must be having a meet . Easy aces . What the hell ? Why do n't we cross over and take Ferringo in the back . Hey , Mr . Bender , if you ask me , why do n't you take them all ? You and I can hit them from the top
zone1	. But they 're all up there in that room . All you have to do is spray the place . You wan na be the boss ? Okay . I make a call to Mr . Maranzano . Keep him quiet , Gap . I 'm getting restless . Boy , oh , boy . You ought to think it over , Mr . Bender . You 're only the wheelman , capisci ? When I give the word , you bring the Packard out to the front . Until then , I do n't wan na hear another word out of you . Please . Okay , Joe , have the engine running , doors open . Hold it a minute . You run up and tell the boss the coast is clear . Boy . - What 's the matter ? - Nothing . Something 's bothering this guy . Why do you talk ? Let him drive , Tony , huh ? I wan na know why he said " boy " like that . Joey , why do you say " boy " like that
zone1	Hit everybody ! Luciano , Genovese , Joe the Boss . What the hell is wrong with you , Bender ? Only the new guy , he has a thought . Why you did n't listen ? You said hit Ferringo , so we hit Ferringo . I believe in iniziativa . - " Initiative . " - Initiative . What organization , it means anything without its people have initiative ? Valachi , he 's a good driver ? Of course he is . You said get the best , I get the best . - You got a suit and tie ? - Sure , Mr . Maranzano . Go away . Come back two hours . - Yes , sir . - Hey . I swear by this man , Tony Bender . You understand ? He was right to do the wrong thing . He was thinking what 's good for the organization . But you were a little more right . From this day on , Joe Valachi , you live by the knife and the gun . You die by the knife and the
zone1	Well , Joe , Gaetano Reina is now your goombah . He is responsible for you . You have a problem , you see him . With what finger you shoot ? Give me your hand . With the spilling of the blood , Joe Valachi we are now one family . Repeat after me in the language of our fathers or otherwise in English . This is the way I will die if I betray the secret of the Cosa Nostra . I will burn like the fires in hell if my tongue speaks like Judas . This being a time of war , I make it short . Two things the most important to remember : First , to betray secret of Cosa Nostra means death without trial . Second to violate any member 's wife , the same . And never use violence with anyone in the family . We help you , because this is now your family . Your job is to be a personal driver for my underboss , Gaetano Reina . He is a fine man , worthy of respect . We are
zone1	. So now , whether from Castellammare or not , we are all one . Today , what happened at Pelham Parkway has got them confused . They do n't know how we discovered their meet . So now we concentrate to get their main bosses : Luciano , Genovese . But most important Joe Masseria himself . He say he will make no deal with us . So until we kill him once and for all the war , it goes on and on forever . Jeez , Bender , you missed one . The same afternoon we hit Dino Roselli and Peter " Brown Eyes " Ellioni . Next day , we took Charlie Ansaldo . He had a nice car . It 's a shame we had to spoil it . That 's Frankie Baretta . The Enforcer , they called him . Nice day 's work . Sometimes it was straightforward and easy . No sweat . You let Masseria come in and take over our machines . - Mr . Maranzano wo n't like that . - I did n't want no trouble . You
zone1	ready to service our machines day and night . Unless you want to change your supplier . Okay . Joe , put back the Maranzano stickers . Like that , my friend , you can sleep better nights . That right , Charlie ? Tell me who came calling ? Who was it left his card ? You do n't have to talk . You only have to deny it was Carlo Torrio . Pity . Carlo Torrio is a nice boy . Does n't look so nice there . And with him , Johnny " Golf Bag " Ponti . Sam Petrelli . But these are our boys who are getting it also : Johnny Buono , Pete Gianola . But somehow we managed business as usual . That was big of you . Well , sometimes you guys gave us a little help yourselves . - Only two cases ? - That 's all . - When do we get some more ? - Next week . - All right , break it up . - Screw you , mister . This son of a bitch did 100

Come on ! Ninety . - Forty-seven . - Come on . Ninety-two . I got so as I knew every bank in the city . Before , I could do the Bronx with my eyes closed . Now , it 's like I am very capable of Wall Street too . Twenty-eight . A hundred twenty-eight napkins , 43 table cloths . And they say they served only 73 dinners . Some people ai n't honest . Chez Aldo . Second time they gave us the wrong count . Someday we go beat them on the head . Hey , hey , ca n't you see this is private ? - Move , move . - Next time , the right count . Understand ? Tomorrow when I call you have that counted money ready . Remember .
zone1	talking ? We were dealing straight , and they was n't . I mean , for instance , take the fish market . This guy Tony ... I forgot his last name . He paid for protection . Some of Masseria 's honkies start to lean on him pretty good . He gives us a call . Pack it up ! And we deliver . Just like the cavalry and the Boy Scouts , Valachi . Just like the cavalry and the Boy Scouts . You know we hit nearly 35 of Masseria 's men the first couple months . The Castellammarese War , they called it . Who killed a boss was gon na get every guy from Castellammare . Any guy who was Sicilian , that is . - Must have been bad for business . - It was terrible . Car ! Come on . Bring him in . Put him on the couch . - My God , Papa . Papa ! Papa . - Put him there . - Oh , God . Papa ! - Be silent . Show dignity . They hit us
zone1	door . You are my husband driver ? You are Joseph Valachi ? Yes , ma'am . - Papa . - Remember this , Maria . Always he lived with death . Always he wait for this to happen . I have learned to wait with him . We know who do it , Donna Letizia . Don Salvatore , I have lost him . Bring him back to me . I can not bring back the dead , only kill the living . My love for your father was without end . I do n't stop till I find ... Too many good men are dead . These killings very bad for everything . With all respect for the widow we did not seek this war . - Who sent you , Mr . Luciano ? - Nobody sent him . - Is true , Mr . Luciano ? Like he said . Salvatore we are from the same country . And now we 've ... It 's our people who die . The blood of our blood . And with the cops on our tail it 's hurting
zone1	n't want to talk about peace Mr . Maranzano we do . - While Joe Masseria live no peace . Please believe when I tell you I held your husband in the highest respect . My condolences . Hurry . No ! They come in peace . Look at that Anastasia . He wants somebody to start something . He 's nuts . Charlie " Lucky " and Genovese said they came for peace . And one day at Scarpato 's in Coney Island , they set out to prove it . How about a game of cards ? Yeah , we play Tresette . I have to go to the john . Vito , there 's a deck in the car . Why do n't you go get it ? Do n't you think someone should call the police ? So that 's how Joe the Boss died ? We never knew for sure . Is that so ? Well , do n't expect me to do no more talking anyhow . - I 'm tired . I 'm gon na get some rest . - Sit down .
zone1	a lot more talking to do . - I ai n't gon na eat that . - So starve . - How do I know it ai n't poisoned ? - You do n't . So you taste . How do I know you ai n't eating only the good part ? I wan na do my own cooking , Ryan . Maybe . If you keep on talking . And I want a hot plate and a refrigerator . And like I said , I 'm not talking anymore . My rules , Valachi . You wan na starve here or go back to where you came , be my guest . What happened then , after Masseria 's death ? What the hell 's that got to do with Genovese ? - Ryan , I wan na get Genovese . - My rules . - All right , we got organized . - Organized ? Yeah . In the borgates . - Territories . - Big deal . You know Italian . - That make you an honorary wop ? - One territory for each family . That
zone1	the capo dei capi . The boss of all the bosses . And it is with humility I accept this title . But as a father , I am also obliged to remind you that all of us here are in a foreign country . And if we do n't help each other like brothers , nobody win . While we were killing , others outside were making their moves . The Irishman , they own the politician . The Jews , like Lepke , Shapiro , they tie up the garment center and the unions . And the Dutchmen , they beat us at the numbers . So , what we do ? We sit still ? - We hit them . We hit them ! - You are right , Anastasia , but first we prepare ourselves . From now on , we divide to form new families . Each borgate will have capo , a boss . Sotto capo , underboss , and then comes lieutenant under them ... - It 's a nice setup , like an army . Yeah . Except the wrong guy is
zone1	family . I already spoke with our friend John Gianola in St . Louis . Capone will be in . Sam Garolla in New Orleans and Pirelli in Detroit . Only here in New York will be different because we are so many , will be five families . Charlie Luciano will head one . Tom Gagliano another . And the others will be under Joe Profaci Joe Buona and Vincent Mangano . Think of it that we will provide the service for the public . Everything what the public wants : Women , the best . To gamble , the horse , the numbers . Everything what the public wants , and we give them a fair deal . Everything except la droga . The drug , it can destroy all all what progress we make ... Sure , afterwards we go and get laid . And remember , what happened in the past is finished . If your own brother was killed in this war you do n't look to find out who did it to get even . You do you pay with your life . From
zone1	soldiers want to see my sotto capo you see Tony Bender . Now I pick for my bodyguard , the Gap . There goes my spare time . And for my driver , I pick Joe Valachi . - Congratulations , Joe . - Thanks . - You have question ? - Very good , very good . Hey , did n't we meet somewhere before ? - Vito Genovese . - I do n't remember but nice to meet you . - Fine . With the help of God , let us bring success to ourselves . And to this thing of ours , great honor . " From the captured spoils he distribute one to each of the soldier of the army . " It 's from Julius Caesar . That 's a way you learn the real command . Everything I learn , I learn from Caesar . No kidding . You remember what Caesar say when he destroy the tyrant Pharnaces . Oh , ca n't say I do , Mr . Maranzano . It slips me . He say : " I came , I
zone1	I saw , I conquered . " That 's terrific . Never know when a line like that might come in handy . You mean , you read all these books , Mr . Maranzano ? Yes , when I was studying to be priest . Oh , yeah , I heard that someplace , Mr . Maranzano . What kind of language is this ? - It 's Lucretius . Is in Greek . - Greek ? You speak Greek ? I speak seven language . Mr . Maranzano , who are all those guys ? Oh , this is Caesar as the high priest of Jupiter . This is Caesar as Roman consular . This is Caesar as dictator and architect of Roman empire . Which reminds me , tomorrow I have a meeting with Genovese and Luciano . I want you both to be there . In case maybe we do n't make arrangement . They betray their own boss . If you was boss you trust them ? Why did n't you break up their family ? They would start another war . I do n't
zone1	, I find out . You no tell anyone , yes ? Good . I no like guns in my office , but tomorrow ... And tomorrow , Tony Bender , he pick me up at half past 1 . You meet me in the office a little before 2 . - Yes , sir . - And here , read this book . Roman Civil War in English . Thanks , Mr . Maranzano . Do n't I get a book ? Some men are born to read , some not . You found me out , Mr . Maranzano . Some things are hard to find out , some not . - Good night . - Good night , Mr . Maranzano . Bet you can get 5 bucks for that book , the leather alone . What the hell 's the matter with you ? It 's a present from him . I do n't read so good , but I 'm gon na try . For him ? Tell me all about it when you finish , please . - You got ta a cock for
zone1	What can I do ? - Open up . Open up . It 's the police . - Yeah , yeah . It 's about time . Veni , vidi , vici , kiddo . Jane , Mary-Lou , meet Joe . - Hi , Joe . Greetings . - Hiya , Joe . Wait , wait . We 're supposed to be in Maranzano 's office at 2 . Do n't worry . The meeting 's called off . - Mary-Lou , make breakfast on him . - Boy , am I hungry . I do n't believe you . I do n't believe you ! Relax . Tony Bender will tell you . You better get rid of that chewing gum . Lay off , Jane . Baby , I 'm ticklish . Hello , Tony ? One second . - Tony , hi . - The meeting 's canceled . Yeah , I 'll let you know when the old man needs you . - Have a swell time . - Yeah , okay . - Take it off , Jane . - Hey , great .
zone1	Okay , Mr . Maranzano . Salerto remember you and the Mad Dog wait at the drugstore telephone . I give the order , you hit and do n't miss . Or we go back on the mattress again , eh ? I hope you do n't decide to call it off . Genovese 's boys took my brother . Valachi , the Gap , they 're late . On their way over . I just got through talking to them . I do n't like they 're late . When they come in , send them in . Yes . Well , what have we got here ? Mad Dog Coll and Steff Salerto out for a walk ? There 's a law against that ? - Move . - Try me . I 'll cover him . Where 's Maranzano ? Sit down . That 's what I asked . What you want ? You got a warrant ? Let me see . You no cops . Come on ! I said , " No guns . " Come on . Help me , Judas . Make the
zone1	So who really killed Maranzano ? I guess you could say it was Luciano and Genovese . They hired the Bugsy Siegel boys to pose like cops . Hey when those phony cops stopped Salerto and Mad Dog Coll they were on their way to do the same thing to Luciano and Vito . A matter of timing , I guess . We always called him " Lucky " Luciano . Yeah , yeah , go on . First , I eat something . Okay , Valachi , you 've had your new toys I promised you . I 'm in a hurry . So let me remind you maybe you 're 99 percent safe , that does n't mean your wife is or your kid , what 's his name ? - You son of a bitch . - Magician , Valachi . Start talking , or I pull more rabbits out of the hat . - Like these letters from home maybe . - You hold back letters from my wife ? Well , it 's nice to know you care . Do you care about their safety
zone1	be safe . - That 's up to you , Valachi . Now , I was asking you ... All right . After Maranzano there was no more capo dei capi . Just Luciano , the Mangano boys , Profaci Venuto , Calliato . The underbosses were Genovese , Anastasia Charlie Calesi and the three Franco boys . The lieutenants were Johnny Gardena Tony Bender , Mick Moretti and Joe Adonis . You heard of him . - Good . Okay . Now , after Maranzano 's murder , which family did you go with ? What kind of dummy are you ? After the murder , I ran . - Mrs . Reina . - Yes . - You remember me ? I 'm Joe Valachi . - Yes , I know . They shot Mr . Maranzano . Now your husband was my goombah , so I ... Come on . Come in . Be careful , Mrs . Reina . These steps , they 're pretty steep . - Let me help you , Mrs . Reina . - Yeah . Thank you . - Hey ,
zone1	moment . Just until things quiet down . - We will bring you food . - You do n't have to , Mrs . Reina . I can always sneak out and get something to eat . - Even the windows have eyes . - Hey , yeah . And Joe Profaci is my brother . Joe Profaci is your brother ? And he always eat here . I see what you mean . Thanks , Mrs . Reina . My husband would do the same . He was a good man . Those pictures really told me a lot about Maria . You know , I never knew a kid could do all those things . I mean , have all those hobbies . When I was a kid , I was just Joe " Cargo . " - Cargo ? - Yeah . Because I used to make these carts out of soapboxes . " Car go , " get it ? You know , I hardly knew my father . Only saw him when we went on trips . But I did have a lot of respect
zone1	your father . - Even the men that killed him ? - Oh , sure , they had respect . You really are a good soldier , are n't you , Joe ? I try . Maybe it 's a feeling you do n't understand that I have for these guys . It 's like we 're all pieces of one another . They make me feel like I belong . Before now , you might say I was a nothing . - Maria . Maria . - Oh , God . Go to your room . Mama , I 'm not a child . Sit . Finish . Sit down . Maria is no toy , Mr . Valachi . I was n't playing with her , Mrs . Reina . Come on . - Yes ? - Good evening , Mrs . Reina . - I 'm looking for Joe Valachi . - I do n't know anybody ... He 's the guy who 's been living in your attic , Mrs . Reina . Mr . Joe Valachi . - What the hell do you want ,
zone1	down . It 's okay . You 're back in the driver 's seat . - Who says ? - Come with me . I 'll show you . - Proof . - The proof is I could 've shot you in the back a week ago being a big man on campus , okay ? Okay . No . No . No . - Charlie , this is Joe Valachi . - Ask him what he wants . - Right now , I 'd like ... - We talked it over . He and the Gap want to go partners on the numbers and slot machines . Give him 20 machines . But for the numbers , they need the bankroll . Okay . Hand them 10 G 's . Mr . Luciano is giving you 20 machines , his own labels . That means no police interference and the credit for a month . You plant them , pay us 50 percent , and they are yours . Any problem , talk with Tony Bender . He 's your lieutenant . That 's pretty good . I already
zone1	Mr ... Mr . Genovese . - Bye , Charlie . - Wait a minute . I got a call from Joe Profaci . Brother of Gaetano Reina 's widow . According to him , Valachi has been seeing the daughter and has not stated his intention . - Can I talk ? Yeah . I got ta be straight . I do n't know nothing about my intentions but I sure would like to marry that girl . Very fine . A nice Italian girl , and the good blood does n't go wasted . Yeah , but the mother , she thinks I 'm a nobody . Not now , she wo n't . Now you are one of the family . - Nice ring . - Very nice ring . Paid for ? Yes , Donna Letizia . Paid for . Cash or with the credit ? Cash . I always pay cash . I got a receipt . No need . No need . Made by the hands of my daughter , Maria . My friend and I we drink to the gracious ladies of this
zone1	for me to speak . I speak now for the future , not for the past which has sometimes been unhappy . From today , Donna Letizia , I wish to be your friend . For friendship is everything . Friendship ... Friendship is more than beauty , more than talent . More than government . More than anything except the family . And perhaps one day , Donna Letizia , you and your fine daughter may have need of friendship . Need of a friend . A friend rather than a lawyer who will lead you in circles and take your money . Or the police , who will end up only by offending and upsetting you . And if such a day should come , I trust that you will turn to me a friend of Joseph Valachi a member of your family , and the man whose friends can be counted among those who have respect not only in this city , in this country , but beyond the seas . Donna Letizia , I await your answer . Damn it , Mama , say yes !
zone1	today what you just did . I know anytime you give an order , that 's it but if ever there 's something special ... Maybe there is something special . I want you and Gap to make a hit . A special hit . There 's my ladies . All right , my ladies , Daddy 's going to do you gentle . You ought to leave , Mr . Genovese . The lights will go down in two minutes . Hold them . - Don Vito , we saw the doctor . - Did you ? Yeah , it 's bad news . I do n't think our friend 's gon na recover . As a matter of fact , he 's gone already . - Natural causes , I hope . - Oh , yeah , you might say that . - Shortage of breath . - Sit down , boys . Vito , I do n't think you ought to stay . No lights . Relax , tonight I want to see the show . - You know her husband ? - No . - Oh
zone1	I do n't . Your special hit . No long speeches . Just want to drink a toast to Joseph and Maria . Happiness , long life and male children . Thank you , thank you . Thank you . Mama , thanks . How about some nice gifts , folks , to set up this tremendous couple , huh ? Why 'd you do that ? Albert , what 's going on ? - Excuse me , please . Excuse me . - The service is lousy . - People always bumping into you . - Behave yourself , Albert . - Or we wo n't let you out at night . - Just I do n't like people crowding me . - Mrs . Valachi . - Good luck . - Thank you . - Good luck , Valachi . Long life to you . Like I said , Joe , you 've showed you sure got taste . - Thank you , Mr . Luciano . - Shall we cut the cake , honey ? Sure . Sure , sure , sure . This way , please
zone1	these friends of ours . Hey , what 's the matter with him ? He did n't recognize you with your clothes on . So Lucky Luciano became the boss ? No , he appointed a commission , a kind of board of directors . Was he a good leader , better than Maranzano ? I was doing okay , so I guess he was good . - How okay ? - I was pulling 2500 a week on the slots . And this new DA , he gets ahold of Luciano and gives him 30 years for running cathouses . Can you believe it ? I figured that was a frame , because Lucky was n't a pimp . So after Maranzano , there was Luciano . Then ? Genovese . But before we knew it ... I give half an hour , tops . The judge is now getting the warrant . Benedetto , could you come here a moment , please . Yes , Mr . Hewitt . It 's official . We 'll have the court order in half an hour . Hewitt ! Hewitt .
zone1	Hate that son of a bitch . I 'd like to have one shot , so help me . - Do you have my bags ? - Give me a minute . - He do n't got a minute . - Valachi is driving me to the docks . Then I better bring the car around now . What can the son of a bitch get you for , Vito ? Everything 's legitimate . Legitimate . He figures somebody has to be minding the store now that Charlie Luck is gone . And he figures me . You ought to know , Albert , even if they nail you on a technicality they still nail you . Tickets ? Tickets ? - Where 's his tickets , Tony ? - In your coat pocket , Vito , honey . You sew up the courts and keep the politicians greased . I 'm seeing Naples and Marseille . When I come back , we 'll have a whole network for drugs . - I want to walk across that border . - But we do n't need the drugs ,
zone1	- Don Vito , you got ta get out of here . Albert I want a good report . You make it nice and easy when I return . Darling , anything you want , you talk with Albert and you will get it . - Jesus , will you go already ? - All right , all right , all right . - Good report , huh ? - Come on . At least I do n't have to see any unemployment in Italy . My good friend Benito Mussolini could talk some sense into that Roosevelt . Well , ciao , everybody . Well , I guess that makes me the boss . But Genovese stayed in Italy till after the war . So the drug thing did n't get started till ' 46 or ' 47 . You tired ? I think I talked too much . Too much . Too much . Well , then , let me go on for you . In the war , you were a loan shark . You muscled in on one of your customers . A guy named Mattie
zone1	set it up for you so that Local 25 did n't bother you as long as you stayed in the Bronx . So now you were a legitimate businessman . You bought into the old Paradise Restaurant . Did all your shylocking there , pedaled all your gas-ration stamps there . Big profits . You bought a new house in Yonkers on Shawnee Avenue . The house cost 48 grand . Later on you added five rooms . - How much did that cost ? - Ten grand . The awnings cost 2500 . Then you went into horse races which is known in the trade as the big fix . - I never threw a race . - Because that would be crooked . Son of a bitch . Your information 's so tight , you go ask anybody . My Knight 's Duchess was one of the best horses on the East Coast and I ran her fair . - Starring Margaret O'Brien . Goddamn it , listen . Salerto came to me with orders from Tony Bender to throw a race . You think I listen ?
zone1	be the sportsman 's sportsman , I wonder . You wan na hear what I said , or do n't you ? All right , Valachi . What did you say ? You son of a bitch ! I do n't pull a horse for nobody ! Joe , you do n't lay a hand on a friend . Those are the rules . It ai n't rules to throw a race . You tell Bender he can go to hell . - You tell him . - There 's gon na be a table , Joey ! There 's gon na be a judgment . And Anastasia is gon na be the judge . Send us ma ? tre d ' . And quick ! Now , everybody knows that Anastasia , he 's crazy . With him , it 's always , " Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Hit them ! Hit them ! " Boy , I did n't think I 'd have a chance at the judgment . The hell 's wrong with you , Valachi ? - I 'll tell you the way it
zone1	been in this life for 20 years . You know better than to hit a guy . - I know that , but Salerto ... - You do n't know shit ! A rule 's a rule . - Taking a swing at one of the family . - He said Tony wanted me to fix a race . - You told Valachi to go fix himself ? - I had 15 grand on that race , Albert . For 15 grand , you tell your own soldier to fix himself ? Well , we all done it for less , Albert , one time or another . Not funny . You are gon na pay Valachi 15 grand . - I ? - And you owe Salerto an apology . - Sure . Hey , Salerto , I 'm sorry . - It 's okay . - But ... But this is a soldier . - Shut up , Tony . Shut up . Lucky , you 're Vito 's man . I had a lieutenant talk back , I 'd have him ate . - Yes , Albert
zone1	, Gap . I wan na talk to you . - I got a message from Don Vito . - Oh , from Italy ? He 's been hearing rumors about Donna and wants you boys to look after her starting this evening at the club . The story is that she 's been screwing around and I 'd like to see her put away . But that 's not my business , so forget I ever said it . You understand ? You understand ? Nobody ever knew why Anastasia was in such a good mood that day . But at one thing he was right about , though , was that girl of Genovese 's . She was trouble . So ? Good evening , Donna . I 'm an agent for Phil Spitalny and His All-Girl Orchestra . - We 're looking for a cymbal player . - Get the hell out ... Actually , I 'm your new bodyguard . And I promised Don Vito I would n't bite off more than I could . Jesus Christ . I got ta ask you a question .
zone1	. With another dame . I follow the bouncing ball . Boy , oh , boy . I 'll be out in the car . I mean , looking at it my way I can only think of me in the middle . Come back tomorrow , honey , we 'll put on a show . Come on , baby snooks . Get up . Say good night to your snookums . - Donna ... Get your hands off me ! - Next time pick on somebody my size . Call Eddie . Tell him to throw these bums out . Okay . Baby , you do n't have to worry about the Gap . For one thing , I ... I would n't know how to explain it to Don Vito . For another , he 'd have you killed . All of a sudden , the son of a bitch sends me a goddamn watchdog . Well , you know how it is , honey when you have a bitch in heat . - Everything okay , folks ? - Sure . It 's all Emily Post ,
zone1	? That 's right . Right . Right . Boy , oh , boy . - That all you can say ? - I can say a lot worse . As far as I was concerned , that girl was a black widow . You know what I mean ? Gap became so far gone , he did n't even care whether he was seen in public with her or not . Where 's Gap ? - Where 's Romeo ? - Mr . Romeo ? Excuse me . Everything seemed to be going great . Everybody was into legitimate rackets , politics , unions . Anastasia , he was happy playing the boss . None of us ever thought Genovese would come back from Italy . But you guessed . - Hello , darling . - Ciao , honey . - Go wait in the car . - Okay . Hello , Bender . You look pretty good and fat . Trying to look our best for you , Don Vito . - What are you doing with our friends ? - Lots of things . - Name five
zone1	to make drug connections ? Jeez , Don Vito , Albert 's kind of told us to lay off drugs . - Hello , Valachi . - Don Vito . - How 's business ? - I got a restaurant , some horses . - How many horses he got , Tony ? - I do n't know . You should , you 're his lieutenant . How about you , Gap ? What have you been up to ? Oh , you know , a couple of numbers . That 's what I 've been hearing . We shall have to lose a lot of weight around here . I do n't like it . A shame Anastasia , he did n't come to meet me . All right . A lot of time to make up . But I 'm in no hurry . Even if it takes years . We got to get back like it was . You are a good friend of the Gap 's , are n't you , Joe ? - Yeah . - Know where he is ? Jeez , Don Vito
zone1	. Sure . Sure . You 're involved in this thing too , Joseph . Get out of here with respect . I want to hear that you saw him . Shall I hit the lights , Mr . Valachi ? No , I 'll take care of that . Lock the back door on the way out . - Good night , Mr . Valachi . - Good night . Joey . Joey , please let me in . Joey , it 's the Gap . Please . Please let me in , Joey . Joey , please . You must be crazy . They got ta know you 'd come here . Lock the door . That goddamn broad told everything . Yeah . What the hell did you expect from her ? Now Vito has an open contract on you . I had a shootout with Bender . - Can you believe it ? With Bender . - Holy hell , Gap . Oh , it was crazy . Like 30 years ago had never happened . You know I 'm supposed to hit you ? Do
zone1	. Right on Pelham Parkway . Remember once when we hit Masseria 's boys . It 's bad for me , it 's bad for my wife and my kid . You just ca n't believe it , Joe . I get off the L , and there they are . They went from me ... Hey , goddamn , Tony . I do n't want shooting here . You can only help the guy just so much . Then you 're out of line . Look , Bender , we 've been together for , Christ , how many years ? Twenty , 30 ? - At least give me a choice . - What choice ? Dead is dead . The way you 're gon na hit me . Wan na shoot me ? Get it over with . Oh , shooting 's terrific . You always loved playing with guns , eh , Tony ? Not having any friends at all . Yeah , I 'd just as soon shoot you , Gap . If it were up to me , I 'd say , " Okay
zone1	a present for a girlfriend of his . Shoot me ! Come on , Salerto , shoot me ! No ! - No ! - Cut it off . - Jesus , no ! - You 'd better apologize to Don Vito . No ! No ! No ! Ca n't leave him like that . There 's his gun . Use it . Oh , God . Jesus Christ , Gap . Christ , Gap . I 'm gon na take you to the hospital . Let 's go . - No . Go away . - Yeah . - Come on . - Leave me alone . - They 're gon na fix you up . Come on . - The gun . The gun , please . They 'll fix you up . Come on , Gap . The gun . Joey , the gun . Oh , hell , Gap . I told you about that broad . - You should have stayed away . - Jesus , anything else ? The gun , please . The gun . Joey , shoot me . Please !
zone1	shoot me . Holy hell , Gap . - Holy hell . - Joey . Joey , please . It 's gon na be okay . It 's gon na be okay . How long has he had the fever ? And what about the doctor ? He said he 'd be back in the morning . - I wan na sleep . - Yeah , that 's right , you sleep , boy . Go ahead , sleep . Me and your mommy are gon na be right here all the time . You go ahead , sleep . I 'll leave this here . You must go away . Just for a short time . Take the boy and go someplace . It 'd be good . They closing in on you again , Joe ? You do n't tell me I 'm wrong . Jesus . I do n't know who the hell 's side I 'm on anymore . It used to be so good . The feeling , everybody working together , belonging together . Oh , Joe , once and for all , get
zone1	your father ? My father was a lieutenant . Like you said yourself , Joe , things were different in those days . Now , every time you try to build something , they take from it . - Some kind of self-respect ... - I not gon na bother explaining to you because you do n't know anything about it . I try not to . What the hell is that supposed to mean ? Joe , there are days you come in and there are nights I know your hands have been covered with blood . Does Mr . Genovese or Mr . Bender give you some kind of magical power so you do n't feel anything ? I never hit nobody that never deserve . Honest to God , Maria . We only hit the guys who cheat on the family . What do you want me to do ? You want me to say , " Hey , Vito , I 'm only gon na hit the following guys " ? You ca n't do that . You see , if you believe in the family
zone1	different than being in the Army . Then why are they closing in on you again , Joe ? Jesus , I do n't know . - You do n't ? - Honest , I do n't know . That 's why I want you to take the boy when he 's feeling better and you go to your cousin 's . And I 'll call you after . After what , Joe ? After what ? After it 's over . Son of a bitch . Now I 'm gon na tell you why it was necessary to hit double-A . Before I went away , we had an organization , a structure . Everybody had a place . Everybody had a position . Everybody was responsible to everybody . When I come back , I learn that nobody knows what anybody else is doing . Or else nobody cares . And when nobody cares , that 's how people get fat . That 's anarchy ! Anastasia commercialized this thing of ours . He brought in hundreds because they were willing to pay money for the privilege of
zone1	can only tell you this : I would n't pay a nickel to join this outfit . I look up on it , I look up on you without respect . - Don Vito ... - Shut up ! First I want to see these people out .

They went through poverty just like yours . I fought every day before , during and after school . Big deal . Instead of being called a wop , I was paddy . I was a mick . The difference between us , Valachi , is that I stopped spreading my legs . Yeah . Yeah . And then you joined Hoover 's team and became Jack Armstrong all-American boy ! Screw you . I do n't have a wife who 's going into hiding . I do n't have a son who does n't know who his father is . I do n't check the windows before I leave my house .

We noticed you 're enlarging the restaurant . - It 's illegal , huh ? - You got a record . - You have to have a license . - License ai n't in my name . Then you wo n't care when it 's revoked , will you , Joe ? First , you find some tax clause to close my dress factory now you 're hustling me about the restaurant .

You guys are twice as crooked as we are . - casualties or damage . New York City : This morning , government agents arrested Mafia kingpin Vito Genovese reported to be directing the flow of drugs on the eastern seaboard . Genovese is being questioned about the predawn shootout on Pier Two in Brooklyn . Police officers state that half a million dollars ' worth of heroin was seized in Genovese 's apartment . And $2.5 million worth was found on the docks . Arrested were Steff Salerto , Vincent Maro and Fred Vilac . Our news . Tehran University Geophysics Institute ... - Hello ? - Hey ,
zone1	's . Hey , Maria . Just talk . Say anything . I wan na hear your voice . Why , hello , Helen . How are you ? I did n't know you were back . We 're all fine , honey . Take care of yourself . All I could do was drive around until I got through to Bender . My own line was tapped . There was no telling who they 'd picked up . All but Tony Bender . - Hey , Tony . - Where are you ? - In the country . - Where ? Outside Hartford . - What 's your number ? I 'll call back . - It 's 642-3948 . Boy , there 'd been so many new guys in the family coming and going could 've been anyone squealing . All I thought about was trying to keep cool . Keep from getting burned . - Somebody set us up . - Don Vito says if he 's arrested , wants everybody with him . - What kind of crazy order is that ? - Do n't worry
zone1	arranged . Oh , no , Tony . I 'm not taking the rap for somebody else . Therefore , this court sentences Joseph Valachi to the federal penitentiary there to serve not less than 15 years from this day forward . You get me an appeal . I can stand for five . But if that 15 sticks I 'm not going into the can alone . You tell Bender that . What do you have to do before you fight back ? I told you everything I had to say . Your books are up-to-date . That 's not enough . Think about Appalachian for a minute . Think about all those heroes running through the woods . - I thought about that a lot . - Stand up , for God 's sake . Joe , listen , there 's a Senate hearing commission . They can make a law . That law will cut them down , prohibit their activities once and for all . But you have to speak , Joe . You have to tell them what you told me . - What 's
zone1	's in it for you . A kind of peace . You wan na stay in hell , that 's your business . I 'm offering you a way out the other side . Suppose I talk to this commission . Then what ? A law goes on the books , and I guarantee it 'll be enforced . And I 'm still in solitary confinement the rest of my life . But at least you wo n't go in there blind . What about Maria ? My kid ? Wherever she wants to go , I give you my personal guarantee that she will get there safely . With a new name , passport and enough money for the rest of her life . - Think it 'll really happen ? - What do you think I 've been after ? Christ , everything you say has tremendous implications for the Justice Department , for the country itself . You can make a break , Joe . Not only for everybody else but for yourself . You can get out of it . - When do I take the
zone1	like you 're on . See you later . When did you become a member of this organization ? - 1930 . - 1930 . What 's the name of it ? Cosa Nostra . - In Italian . - Cosa Nostra . In Italian . I think that it 's an important question that there is no particular pattern which would make you feel the crime is in any way a problem associated with those of Italian extraction . Senator , I 'm not talking about Italians . I 'm talking about the Mob . Continue . They gave me this piece of paper . - I was to burn it . - Demonstrate what you did . In other words , I took this piece of paper . It 's burning . It 's lighted in your hand . That was symbolic of the fate that was to befall you ... - ... if you betrayed the organization ? - Senator , what I 'm telling you what I 'm exposing to you to the press and to everybody this is the promise I 'm breaking . Even
zone1	. This thing 's fabulous . They 're trying to make a monkey out of him . I hope they nail his ass 10 times over . We 're after headlines , for God 's sake . They 're after votes . So Genovese was your godfather . Godfather is different . When you ... When you go to the church , you baptize a baby . This is a godfather . The sworn testimony you just heard came from the lips of Joseph Valachi . Lips supposedly sealed more than 33 years ago when he joined the Cosa Nostra . But today , before a nationally televised Senate hearing the 60-year-old convicted burglar , dope peddler and murderer talked in such a way that he seemed to draw the sympathy of the crowd and the crime committee . Valachi said he was talking because he wanted to . But it 's possible that he is talking to protect himself from his syndicate boss , Vito Genovese who had ordered him killed as an informer . - But how safe do you feel ? - How I feel now ?
zone1	Now , at this moment ? - Yes . I feel fine . How would you feel if you were back in prison ? I would have to protect myself against them , senator . I would have to kill ... - ... or be killed . - Now , would it be fair to say that if you went back to prison that you would be a dead man ? If they got to me , I would n't be in prison five minutes . - Two . - Now here , we show you the Genovese family , broken down into its various units demonstrating the wide range ... Listen carefully . A hundred thousand dollars for Joe Valachi . Hold it . You were fine . No fault of yours . - From your wife . - Room 's clear , sir . Cheer you up . - which would make him feel that crime is in any way a problem associated with those of Italian extraction . Senator , I 'm not talking about Italians . I 'm talking about the Mob . Continue . In
zone1	And it 's burning . It 's lighted in your hand . That was symbolic of the fate that would befall you if you betrayed the organization ? Senator , what I 'm telling you what I 'm exposing to you to the press and to everybody ... - I did n't have time to see it all . - You were lucky . He 's kind of ridiculous . Like a bad comic strip . That 's what it was . I 'll see you . Guard ! Guard ! Help ! Get in here ! Take the weight off his legs . Get the chair up . - I got his legs . - Cut him down . Cut him down . Let me have him slowly . That 's it . Easy . - Steady now . - Put him on the table there . Put him on the table . - Where 's the doctor ? Get the doctor ! - All right . Right here . Okay , boys . Thanks a lot . Attaboy . Come on , buddy . Open up . -
zone1	him . - Come on , buddy . - Move over . We gave him some letters from his wife and he just tore them up . Look . You knew he was in a depressed state . Why was n't he given sedation ? Look , Mr . Ryan , I ca n't have a doctor , a psychiatrist and 24 guards watching your canary for the rest of his life . - I know . I 'm sorry . - Wait a minute . He 'll be all right . He 's as strong as a bull . As soon as he 's better , take him to the infirmary . - All right , doctor . I will . Thank you . - Thank you . Come on , Joe . Let me give you a hand . Take it easy , Joe . Get over on the bed . Come on . Let me help . Here . Joe , I was just ... Yeah , yeah . You were just following orders . Joe , I do n't make the laws . Christ , do
zone1	got burned , Ryan . You wanted the law . But they wanted a gangster story . I thought maybe you had something better . I admit I 've been had all along . Yeah , well , you were n't the only one . I 've been taken too . Believe me , Joe . I 'm sorry . Oh , hell . It 's like you said I 'm gon na spend the rest of my days in prison but I do n't go in blind . Any time you wan na come visit we 'll crawl together . Well , at least you get Genovese on the run . I hear he 's got $ 100,000 out for you . Anybody else , it would be a million . Genovese he 's a cheap guy . Joe , you son of a bitch , you know what you almost just did ? - Yeah . - You almost took your own contract . If you had committed suicide that bastard would n't have had to shell out a nickel . Hey , Ryan , you scored 100
zone1	keep you alive just to spite that punk . Yeah , and that 's not a bad reason to live . Sheer goddamn spite . Joe , let 's get you to the infirmary . - I 'm okay . - I say you 're not . Guard ! First thing we do is get you back in shape . I 'll have you moved , Joe . Somewhere in the country . I 'll handpick the guards myself , Joe . Make sure none of those Cosa Nostra bastards ever gets at you again . That 's got ta be the one thing I do , Joe : Make sure you live long after Genovese 's dead and gone .

Now do n't forget what I said . Just stay away from him . But , Mummy , he 's such a nice old man . Do n't argue with me . You 're not to see him again ever .

[Sobbing] [Enid] , this may not be the best moment to talk about this , but , uh ... it may alleviate some of your other worries . You realize this accident makes you a rich woman . Rich ? Ralph 's insurance . He always carried a large policy ... with a double indemnity against accident . Oh , [Charles] , I wished for lots and lots of money . Ralph warned me not to . - No , that 's a coincidence , surely
zone1	statuette-It gave us three wishes . I used one of them to wish for lots and lots of money . Now I 'm going to wish for Ralph back . [Charles] . Do you know the story of " The Monkey 's Paw " ? That 's the story of the old couple who are given a monkey 's paw ... which entitles them to three wishes . They wish for money , and they get the money ... because their son is killed ... in a machine in his factory , crushed . - [Enid] . You must n't wish Ralph back . - Why not ? Well , in the story , this mother wishes her son back , and he does come back ... but in the condition in which he died- mutilated , mangled , torn . [Enid] I must be careful not to make the same mistake . I shall wish that Ralph were back as he was before the accident . I wish ... Ralph were back exactly as he was ... immediately before the accident . [Pounding] [Pounding] - Open it ! Quickly
zone1	His body was mangled in the crash . Mangled ? It was n't mangled . Mr . Jason died of a heart attack at the wheel . [Door_Closes] I wished to bring him back as he was immediately before the accident . But he was already dead- dead from a heart attack . So the accident did n't kill him . - Only one more wish . - Enid-- Please go away . Leave me alone . - Please-I want to be alone with him , please . Only one more wish . Only one . I must n't waste it . I must be careful . Oh , please , please ... I wish Ralph were alive now . I do n't want him to die ever . I want him moving , breathing , talking , alive- now , forever ! [Screaming] - Ralph ! - Oh , [Enid] ! Ralph ! [Charles] ! - Help me ! - What 's happened ? - Oh ! - [Charles] What have you done ? I wished alive again- forever ! Do n't you realize he 's been embalmed ?
zone1	into him ! - Oh , no ! [Sobbing] [Enid] ! Do something ! [Screaming_Continues] For God 's sake , [Enid] ! Help me ! No , no ! [Enid] , do n't ! - Aah ! Aah ! - [Enid_Grunting] But do n't you see ? You wished him alive forever ! You ca n't kill him ! Every piece of_him is alive still ! Alive and- and suffering ... forever . [Sobbing] [Man] Well , what did you see ? - What did he see ? - What 's more important is what you will see . Who are you ? What do you want with us ? - To warn you of what may happen . - I do n't care about your warnings . - I want to get out of here . - Very well . But you should heed the warning . [Panting] [Birds_Chirping] [Parking_Brake_Cranks] - Mr . Rogers ? - Major Rogers . Show me to my quarters and have somebody get my kit in , will you ? - Shane , here . - [Barking] Good boy . [Clanks] There were pictures
zone1	property of your predecessor , sir . Well , we must get some more . I 'll go down to London , have a look around the galleries . Where are the men- uh , the patients ? They 've gone to lunch , sir . You mean dinner , do n't you ? Bon app ? tit , Mr . Carter . Thank you , Harry . [Men_Chattering] [Man_Coughs] Good morning . My name is Rogers . Major William Rogers . I 've been appointed your new superintendent here , and take up my duties today . I 've had considerable experience in dealing with men as an officer in the army . I promise you I will do this job to the best of my ability . I hope we 'll all get along well . If there are any complaints ... I shall be pleased to deal with them in my office at any time . - Good morning . - [All_Mumbling] Good morning . Morning . - Shane . - [Barking] [Door_Closes] Well , Shane ... after I 've made a few changes ... I think
zone1	cold . - It 's always like that now . - [Coughing] [Wheezing] All right , old boy ? All right . I 'll get you an extra blanket . - [Knocking] - Yes ? The men have asked me to come and talk to you . Yes ? It 's about the heating . It 's been very cold these past few nights . We wondered if you-For reasons of economy , the heating is now turned off each evening at 2000 hours . You should all be in bed by then . After all , there 's no point in staying up . - You ca n't see anything . - The beds are cold . There are n't enough blankets . I 'm trying to run this place as efficiently and as economically as I can . I 'm afraid the current budget does not include the costs of new blankets . Do you know anything about blind people ? No , I ca n't say I do , until I took over this job . But I was in the army for over 20 years ,
zone1	. With all due respect , sir , we are not soldiers . And blind people are not like people with sight . We have lost one sense ... but the loss of that one sense only tends to sharpen the others . Do you know what that means ? We feel things more acutely . If food is bad , it tastes worse to us . If a room is dirty , we feel every speck . If an insect scurries across the floor , we hear it . And if it 's cold , we feel the cold more . Why do n't you sell that painting and buy us fuel or extra blankets ? I was not aware that the administration of expenditure for this establishment ... had been handed over to you , Mr . Carter . Good morning . [Door_Slams] - Dishwater . - Filthy muck . There 's no meat in it . Sorry , dad , there ai n't no more . No second helping ? Well , rations were cut , you see ? Superintendent says he 's doing the best he
zone1	knock on the door of a private office . What do you want ? Ca n't you see I 'm having my lunch ? What is it ? Nice juicy steak , while we get nothing but slop ? I do the best I can for you within the limits of the budget provided for me . - But you eat meat ... and drink wine . - I am the officer in charge . - This is n't the bloody army ! - Mr . Carter ! In the kingdom of the blind , even the one-eyed man is king . - Shane ! - [Barking] Shane , stay . Here . [Gasping] [Wheezing] [Coughing] Doctor . Get a doctor . Do you realize it 's gone midnight ? Doctor ! Who wants a doctor ? It 's Greenwood , sir . Well , ca n't it wait till the morning ? He 's ill , sir . Very ill . Well , I suppose I 'd better take a look . [Barking] Shane , wait . Blanket . [Wind_Whistling] Well , which one is Greenwood ? The man
zone1	? Shane ? What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Go back to your rooms , all of you ! It 's our turn to give the orders now ... Major Rogers , sir . Well , what-what is it ? What-Wh-What do you want ? [Footsteps_Approaching] [Chattering] , [Grunting] [Door_Slams] [Pounding] Let me out of here ! Let me out ! [Shane_Whining] - Shane . - [Barking] Shane . All right , boy . All right . All right , boy . What are you doing to my dog ? What are you doing to my dog ? [Birds_Chirping] - [Clattering] - [Shane_Growling] [Barking] [Barking_In_Distance] [Grunting] Let me go ! Let me go ! [Grunts] Let me go ! Let me go ! [Grunts] Let me go ! [Barking_Continues] Your dog seems to be getting hungry , Major Rogers . Feed him , please . Please , feed him . All in good time . Yes , but you must feed him . He - He 'll be dangerous . He 'll go wild , berserk ! I know , Major Rogers , sir . [Barking_Continues]
zone1	'll see ... soon enough . Look , give me something to eat , please . Please ! I have n't had anything to eat or drink for over two days . Please , please ! Well , at least feed my dog , please ! He 'll be fed , all right ... Major Rogers , sir . [Wood_Scraping] [Creaking] [Shane_Snarling_In_Distance] [Creaking] [Screams] Aah ! Aah ! You- [Snarling] [Barking] No ! Shane ! [Screams] What is all this ? I 'm on my way to a new job . I do n't know ... why I stopped here . I do . Now you may go . [Scraping] [Thunder_Rumbling] But how can we- Where are we ? In a place where people go who have died without repentance . You see , I was n't warning you ... but telling you why you are here ... for all eternity . [Screams] And now ... who 's next ? Perhaps you ? [Thunderclap]
zone1	3287491 I 've come back . Give me a drink , Brother Kipling . Do n't you know me ? No . I do n't know you . Who are you ? What can I do for you ? I told you . Give me a drink . It was all settled . Right here , in this office . Remember ? Danny and me signed the contract and you witnessed it . You stood over there . I stood there . And Daniel stood here . Remember ? Carnehan ! Peachy Taliaferro Carnehan . Of course . Keep looking at me . lt helps to keep my soul from flying off . Carnehan ! The same , and not the same , who sat beside you in a first-class carriage on the train to Marwar Junction three summers and a thousand years ago . Jodhpur , please . Blast ! All aboard ! May I ? Riding in this ashcart is like being kicked by a mule every 10 minutes ! Mr . Clutterbury Das . Failed entrance examination , Calcutta University , 1863 . Writer of correspondence for the illiterate general public . Shut up ! Thank you
zone1	! - Thank you , sir . Outside , you inky-fingered thief ! - l hope you break your neck ! - Thank you , sir . - You might have killed him ! - Serves him right if I had ! - We 're not making five miles an hour . - But why ? - l caught him stealing your watch . - My watch ? I say , it is my watch ! Well ! I 'm very much obliged to you , Mr ... ? Carnehan . Former gunnery sergeant in Her Majesty 's Forces . Mine 's Kipling . - May I offer you a drink ? - l do n't mind if I do . You 've knocked about India a bit , I take it . You can say that twice ! On foot , on horseback and on camel . - You do n't look green , either . - l was born in India . Great country , or was till bureaucrats took over and ruined everything . - l hope you 're not one of them ! - No .
zone1	noses for looking down at you . And I 've yet to have one of them offer me a drink ! - Glenlivet , 12 years old . - You 've an educated taste . I have an educated taste in whiskey , women , waistcoats and bills of fare . But I 've had few chances to ex ercise it . Because them that governs make up laws to stop men like us from getting anywhere . Whose loss is it ? England 's , of course ! If we were unrestrained , she would n't get 70 millions in revenue ... - ... it would be 700 millions ! Right ? - l quite agree , yes . - Where are you heading for ? - Jodhpur . - Will you return on this line ? - ln 10 days . Can you make it eight ? I have a message for a man travelling through Marwar Junction on the 24th . He expects to meet but I have urgent business . I 'm sorry , I ca n't help you there . Supposing I was to ask
zone1	for that which was lost . What would you say then ? I should answer , where do you come from ? From the East . I am hoping that you will give my message on the square for the sake of the widow 's son . - Which lodge do you hail from ? - Travelling Lodge 3276 , Fore and Fit . The Queen 's Own Royal Loyal Light Infantry , Regimental District 329A . - To whom is the message ? - Daniel Dravot . - Dravot . - A big man with long gray sideboards . A great swell . You 'll find him in a first-class compartment . Do n't be af raid . Slip the window down and say , " Peachy 's gone south for the week . " - " Peachy 's gone south for the week . " - Yes , and he 'll tumble . Well , I 'll be getting off now before we reach the station . By the way , Brother Carnehan ... . l missed my watch in the station at Lahore before boarding the train
zone1	? What 's this ? God 's holy trousers ! Tickets again ? is your name Dravot , sir ? I 'm to say that Peachy has gone south for the week . He 's gone south for the week . Did he say I 'd give anything for this ? I won't . - No , he didn't . - Then why did you do it ? For the sake of the widow 's son . - He said south , did he ? - Yes . Then that 'll be Degumber . Since you 're Peachy 's pal , I 'll tell you . We 're gon na put the screw on the rajah for what he did to his mother-in-law . Filled her with peppers and flogged her to death . You mean you intend to blackmail him ? You would n't get out alive ! If they do n't cut your throat , they 'll poison you . Both 's been tried . Peachy and me do n't kill easy ! The rajah 's an independent ruler . He answers to nobody . How will you
zone1	're correspondents for The Northern Star . You ca n't ! You ca n't do that ! Because I am the correspondent of The Northern Star ! - You what ? - l 'm the correspondent ! Eh ? What did you say , brother ? As you know , we took them at the Degumber border so there 's a question of jurisdiction . But a charge of conspiracy to blackmail might be brought . I did n't lay this information before you as a criminal prosecution . Only to save their lives . May I ask what particular interest you have in these scoundrels ? Well , they happen to be Freemasons . Like myself . Freemasons ? Them ? I 'd think you 'd strike them off your roll ! Oh , once a Mason , always a Mason . Never could understand how pukka chaps like you can go about wearing aprons and sashes and shaking hands with strangers . What is Masonry , Kipling ? It 's an ancient order dedicated to the brotherhood of man , under the eye of God . We should
zone1	work here . There are tales that it did work here , before we came . Some audacious scholars can trace it to the builders of Solomon 's Temple . - Old wives ' tales , I suspect . - Yes , in all likelihood , sir . Well , let 's have a look at your lodge brothers . Right turn . Halt . Hats off ! You men are not under arrest thanks to Mr . Kipling , who 's a real correspondent for The Northern Star . But both of you richly deserve to be in jail . I have your records before me . There 's everything from smuggling to swindling receiving stolen goods and barefaced blackmail ! I resent the accusation . It is blackmail to threaten to publish information . What blackmail is there in accepting a retainer to keep it out ? How did you propose to do that ? Telling the editor what I know about his sister and a certain government official . Let him put that in his paper if he has need of news ! You should have gone
zone1	porter 's uniform outside a restaurant ? Tips for closing cab doors on civilians and their blowzy women ? Not for us , after watching Af ghans take command ... - ... when the officers had copped it ! - Well said ! There may be no criminal charges , but I 'll see these files reach Calcutta with the advice you be deported as political undesirables . Detriments to the empire and the raj . Detriments you call us ? Detriments ? Detriments like us built this bloody empire and the izzat of the raj ! Hats on ! About turn ! By the left , quick march ! Left turn ! There 's no need to let any of this get into the Star , I take it , Kipling ? No , no , no . Copy . My God ! You two ! What do you want this time ? - We want to ask you a favour . - Another favour ? Calm down , we 've never taken advantage of a fellow in the craft . We do n't want money , just a
zone1	a study of your maps . We 'll take a drink , but if not , we wo n't mind . Peachy is as sober as I am . It 's important you have no doubts . So we 'll take one of your cigars apiece , and you shall watch us light up . And now , sir let me introduce you to Brother Peachy Carnehan , which is him and Brother Daniel Dravot , which is I . The less said about our jobs , the better . We 've been most things . We 've been all over India . We know her cities , jungles , jails and passes . We have decided she is n't big enough for us . The commissioner said that . We 're going to another place where a man is n't crowded and can come into his own . We 're not little men , so we 're going away to be kings . - Kings of Kafiristan . - Oh , Kafiristan . We hear they have two and 30 idols there . So we 'll be the 33rd
zone1	, meaning a land of opportunity for such who can train and lead men in battle . We 'll go there and say to any chief we find : " Want to vanquish your foes ? " He 'll say , " Of course , do it . " We 'll fight for him , make him king and then subvert him . We 'll seize his royal throne and loot the country . How 's that for a plan ? You 're both out of your minds ! To start with the only way to get there is through Af ghanistan . Kafiristan ? No , no , no . Two white men would be cut to pieces five miles into the Khyber Pass . Just suppose we managed it . Just suppose . And suppose we got across the Af ghan plains , then what ? There 's the Hindu Kush , a f rozen sea of peaks and glaciers . A party of geographers tried several years ago and vanished into thin air . No white man has ever been there and come out since Alexander .
zone1	. 300 years before Christ . If a Greek can do it , we can do it . Right . I can only repeat , you 're a pair of lunatics ! Would a pair of lunatics draw up a contract like this ? " This contract between us , pursuing and witnesseth in the name of God . One : We will settle this together , i.e . , to be kings of Kafiristan . Two : We will not , while this is being settled , look at liquor or any woman , so as to get mix ed up with one or the other harmf ul . Three : We act with dignity and discretion . If one is in trouble , the other stays by him . Signed by us this day . " There 's no need for the last article , but it 's got a ring to it . Daniel . Now , you witness it and it 's legal . Well , gentlemen , it 's 4 in the morning . Do n't stand on politeness . lf you want to go
zone1	you . We 'll send word when we 're ready to go , if you want to say goodbye . Yes . Well , try not to burn the place down . Here we are . " Kafiristan . 10 , 000 square miles . Mountainous terrain . Religion unknown . Population unknown . Conquered by Alexander in 328 B.C . According to Herodotus , he defeated King Oxyartes whose daughter Roxanne he subsequently took to wife . " You buy from me , I give you good price . Very cheap , very nice things for you , especially for you , sir . Our forward continuance is impeded by this fellow , who is begging you will accompany him that he may show you a rare and wonderf ul thing . - What thing ? - He would not say what thing . Therefore , I suspect his bad intentions to entice you into a house of disreputation where he will take you , kill you , murder you cut your throat and rob the money from your pockets also . Crikey ! - Wait at the office
zone1	take you to a loving house . You will be very happy and delightf ul ... . Morning to you , brother . Glad you caught the performance . What do you think ? It 's convincing , but what are you rascals up to now ? Last week it was kings you were to be , of Kafiristan . - We 've got ta get there first . - Madness is a trick . Who 'd hurt some poor crazy priest and his servant ? Peachy worked this out . We 've used it before . He talks , while I act dumb . I can clown pretty good now . I can twitch to put the fear into any good Muslim . I can f roth at the mouth . Want to see ? - l can imagine . - All right , some other time perhaps . Come over here . Give it a touch-up down here . - Rifles ? - Twenty Martinis , and ammunition . Cost us every sou we got out of the rajah of Degumber . Good heavens ! You mean you
zone1	God help you if you 're caught with those ! Gunrunning is n't exactly new to us . Well , Brother Kipling , goodbye and many thanks . Man , do n't do it ! The odds are too great . Wish us luck . We met upon the level . And we 're parting on the square . Good luck , indeed . Come along , you ugly beast . Wait ! Here . Take this . Last time Danny and me came through the Khyber Pass , we fought our way yard by bloody yard and General Bobbs called us heroes afterwards . But that was years ago . Times have changed . - Blast ! Look who 's on sentry ! - Mulvaney ! That loudmouthed mick from the Black Tyrone ! Private Mulvaney ! Come to attention when I am addressing you ! Slope arms ! Present ! March ! Mark time ! At the double ! Corporal of the guard ! Take three men and put Private Mulvaney under arrest ! Bloody man 's drunk again ! We came through the Khyber with that caravan
zone1	At night , he told them their fortunes in a tongue of his own and I translated . And all concerned were happy because I promised them all their wishes would come true . Then at Jaedallak we turned off towards Kafiristan . They were sad to see us leave the caravan . We 'd brought it good luck . Two she-camels had foaled and there was no sniping at us from the hills . They waved goodbye to the mad priest and his servant . And Danny danced them out of sight . The country was deserty . The inhabitants were dispersed , solitary . We travelled by night and kept away from villages . We did n't want to waste ammunition in idle fighting with Afghans . The Pushtukan . A wavy blue line on the map , but we could n't hope to get camels across . So Peachy says , " It does n't matter what they cost we 'll trade them for goats . We 're playing for high stakes . " Major McCrimmon bet me 10 bob he could blow up a goat skin
zone1	sat down on an anthill in his kilt unknowing . Ten shillings was ten shillings to McCrimmon ! Mules . Now , the problem is how to divide five Af ghans from three mules ... - ... and have two Englishmen left over . - Shoot them . No . The mules would bolt . Sit over there , Danny . So we starts forward into those bitter cold mountainous parts and never a path broader than the back of your hand . The mountains was tall and white like wild rams , they was always fighting so you could n't sleep for the din of their fighting . For God 's sake , Danny , pipe down . - Why ? Who 's going to hear us ? - These mountains , that 's who . - You wan na start an avalanche ? - You do n't believe that , I hope . If a king ca n't sing , it ai n't worth being king . The country was mountainous and the mules was most contrary . They all died but one . And she died later
zone1	tail . Up and up we went , and down and down . Through defiles and over snowy saddles till all at once two giants stood in our way . God 's holy trousers . What 's the matter ? Blokes twice our size standing guarding the snow , like . Two of them . Give them a round apiece . Not a move out of them . Stay put . I 'll reconnoitre . They 're not real , thank God . They 're horrible . Put there by the Kafiris to f righten the neighbours . Peachy , that means we 're in Kafiristan . Or almost . So it does . - What was that ? - Our bridges have been burned . What do you mean ? The bridge we crossed by ai n't there no longer . God . Now what ? - Tell me . - A crevasse . We 've had it , Danny . Coming and going ! - Wide ? - Wide enough ! It drops into nothing below , straight as a beggar can spit ! That 's the last
zone1	. It looks like last post , Danny . I do n't fancy dying by inches . Feeling the cold creeping up my limbs . - Getting all numb . - l 'll do the necessary ... - ... when the fire goes out . - Fair enough . Bloody shame . Getting this close and not making it . A stone 's throw away , our kingdom . I 'd have liked to seen you , Danny , with a gold crown on your head . If you could 've found one that fitted it . Peachy , in your opinion have our lives been misspent ? Well , that depends on how you look at it . The world 's not a better place because of us . No , hardly that . - Nobody 's gon na weep at our demise . - And who 'd want them to ? And we have n't many good deeds to our credit . None . None to brag about . But how many have been where we 've been ... - ... and seen what we 've seen ?
zone1	Even now , I would n't change places with the viceroy himself ... - ... if it meant giving up my memories . - Me neither . Remember the time the Highlanders was retreating down the hill at Ali Masjit and Pipe Major McCrimmon got his sporran shot off ? Half a crown was in it , right ? So he goes after it without checking to see if that was all he 'd lost ! And then he got the Victoria Cross because the Highlanders followed him up the hill ! Danny , we can get on ! Kafiristan . The promised land . Must be their Halloween . Upsadaisy , lad . Brass band and all . Hail the conquering heroes . Bloody cheek . Where 's their gratitude ? I say ! I say there ! Are you Englishmen , please ? Stone the bleeding crows ! Yes , mate . - And who might you be ? - You just wait one jiffy . Peachy , it 's a Gurkha . Rifleman Machendra Gurung . Known to my regiment as Billy Fish . is that right
zone1	doing here ? Wherever here is . - l come with Colonel Robertson , sir . - The geographer ? Oh , dear me , alas , by Jove . Party not reaching Er-Heb for very misfortunate reasons . Large mountain is falling on everyone . Everybody buried alive ex cept your servant . What about them up there banging drums and then shooting arrows at us ? Big noise to scare away devils ! - Many devils here these days . - They thought we was devils ? Kafiristan peoples very ignorant . I say to head man Ootah , I say , " Oh , no , by Jove , they 're not devils they 're Gorasahibs . British soldiers . " Good man , Billy Fish . And now , if you 'll take us to this Ootah bloke we will begin his education . People of Er-Heb , do not fear . They are our f riends , not our enemies . Do you understand ? Do not fear . There is no need to fear . They 're our f riends . Why are you
zone1	fear ! They 're from England ! British soldiers ! White men . Do not be af raid . Ootah ! Come on down . No need to be af raid . They 're white men . Ootah ! Come down ! Do n't be af raid . Tell him we wo n't hurt him , not to worry . He wants to know where you come from . Tell him we tumbled from the skies . He wants to know , are you gods ? Not gods , Englishmen , which is the next best thing . I ofttimes tell Ootah about Englishmans . How they name dogs , take off hats to womans and march left , right with rifles on their shoulders . Bringing enlightenment to the darker regions of the earth . He wants to know how rifle works . Show him , Peachy . We are not gods , exactly , but we are heaven-sent to deliver you from your enemies . Enemies all around . The Bashkai are the worst . All town comes out and pisses downstream when we go bathing . Shocking
zone1	masks . And so our head chap is thinking them devils ... - ... and running like bloody hell away . - War ! Red war we 'll give them . He give you two goats for each Bashkai man you 're killing . One goat for each womans and childs . Rather than knock them over one at a time we 'd like to do it in one fell swoop . Serve him up a proper victory . Storm Bashkai , take the city . He says , " How much ? " Only the honour of leading the brave men of Er-Heb into battle . And what we fancy in souvenirs . - A bauble here and a bangle there . - Bashkai is only the beginning . We hope to go on from victory to victory until he runs out of enemies . And a monarch of all you survey . - All he surveys ? - From the highest place in the valley . The mountains will echo your name . Ootah the Great ! Oh , he says he prefers " Ootah the Terrible .
zone1	take him in token of our earnest . And now the womans of Er-Heb will cut his bollocks off ! Could n't happen in a better cause . - Contract . - Contract . Ootah say , " You , you no like ? " Tell him we 've given up strong drink until we 've conquered all his enemies . Boil them once or twice in hot water and they 'll come out like chicken and ham . You would n't know them from the Gaiety Chorus . - Ootah says , " Take your pick . " - He does ? Oh , tell His Majesty one 's prettier than another . I could n't choose . Take as many as you like . There are more where they came from . He has 27 daughters . They 're his daughters ? His own daughters ? - Dirty old brute ! - Different countries , different customs . Must n't be prejudiced , Peachy . Tell His Majesty we 've also taken a vow not to dally with females till all his enemies are vanquished . He has
zone1	he makes my gorge rise ! Hold on , Peachy , he 's only being hospitable according to his likes . Polo ! Everything 's the same . The ball 's bigger . - ls the ball always that big ? - Depends on size of head . Big head , big ball . This here Bashkai man . Big damn head . The bloody heathens . Different countries , different customs . Must n't be prejudiced . Now , listen to me , you benighted muckers . We 're gon na teach you soldiering , the noblest profession . When we 're done , you 'll be able to slaughter enemies like civilized men ! But first , you 'll have to learn to march in step do the manual of arms without having to think . Good soldiers do n't think , they just obey . You think if a man thought twice , he 'd die for his country ? Not bloody likely ! He would n't go near the battlefield ! One look at your foolish faces tells me you 're going to be crack troops
zone1	makings of a bloody hero . Timing in the British Army has always been : " One , two , three . " One , two , three . Say after me , " One , two , three . " Wait . Ready , steady , go . One , two , three . One , two , three . Say it at the same time as the others . Tell him to say it at the same time ! Right . Go ! One , two , three . One , two , three . Billy , tell him to say it with the others ! One , two , three . Right . Now ready , steady , go . One , two , three . No ! He 's saying it before the others , Billy . Not before them , not after them , with them ! Right . Attention ! No . You , look ... . That one goes to there ! Say that one goes to there ! That 's it ! Down there , like that . There . There we

You 're a handsome piece , that I do n't deny but the contract states the party of the first part , Danny and the party of the second part , which is me shall nowise compromise ourselves with parties of the third part , which is you . All binding , properly sworn to witnessed and attested . - Danny ! - So ! Thank God you arrived . Let 's go seek safety in battle . Trumpeter , sound your trumpet ! Billy Fish . Blood is what we want . The bloodier , the better . So it shall be ! Like old times , Peachy . Reminds me of Ali Majid . It 's a good job the odds are only 10 to 1 . Halt ! Line up in a straight line here . Present ! Aim ! Who are they ? What 's happening ? Very holy men
zone1	. Battle is postponed until priests have passed . - Why are their eyes closed ? - They do n't wish to see any badness . so keep eyes closed until they return to beauties of Sikandergul . Fire ! Aim ! Fire ! Charge ! Come on . Oh , that great bloody showoff ! Rifle section , form line ! Fix bayonets ! Advance ! Volley fire ! Commence ! Charge ! What did you think you were playing at charging single-handed ? - l got carried away . Blood was up . - Acting like a green lieutenant hoping to be mentioned in dispatches ! - You ought to be ashamed ! - Sorry . Supposing you got killed . Where would I be at ? - Wo n't happen again . - See it do n't ! - Why are you carrying that arrow ? - No particular reason . Hold on ! What 's he up to ? He say he win this big battle . According to custom ... - ... he lop off their heads . - Great warrior ? I never saw
zone1	's no prisoner ex ecutions in this army . Tell him to put that sword away . He says once sword unsheathed , it must taste blood . Just as I thought . He has n't had it out until now ! He says watch out or he get very angry and lop your head off . All right . Up you get . Off your hunkers . No more grovelling . We are n't gon na torch your city or hang you in chains , nor rape your daughters . Tell them to divide their goods in half and we will choose which half we want . Henceforth , let the men of Er-Heb and the men of Bashkai be as brothers . Brothers in arms . Let them march under one banner and share in the victories to come . Have the Bashkai any enemies to speak of ? Oh , enemies all around ! Bhardoks , Ghundaras , Shus , Khawaks . The Bhardoks piss downstream on Bashkai people when they bathe . Shocking ! We 'll strike them and grind them into dust ! Silver bracelet
zone1	same , worth a fiver at least . Earring with bangles . One pig sticker with plain handle . A gold coin worn pretty thin . A rosy red ring and a few other one's , plain . All this should fetch 10 or 15 quid in a London shop . Not too bad for the back of beyond . Sikander ! They 're calling for you . For me ? Sikander . Sikander . What does Sikander mean , Billy ? Sikander a god . Come here long ago from the West . That 's the bloke Kipling told us about . Alexander ? Alexander . Sikander . Here . - Alexander . - He builded great city . Sikandergul , high in mountains . Sit on throne . All people worship him . Then one day , time comes , he say he must go to East . People pull their hair out , tear clothes . So Sikander promised to send back son . 328 B.C . , encyclopaedia said . They saw arrow go into Danny 's chest , him pluck it out , and not
zone1	They think I 'm a god ? A god ! Put your foot out that I may kiss your big toe . - You may kiss my royal arse . - Not royal , holy ! - You 're a deity , remember ? - Peachy . - Yes , Billy ? - ls Danny not son of Sikander ? No , he 's a man like us . He can break wind at both ends simultaneous . Which I bet is more than any god can do ! But the arrow . The arrow stuck in the bandolier . No miracle . You better tell them . And my dad 's name was Herbert Dravot , Esquire and he was a bar steward in Durham ! Hang on , Danny . - Maybe we 're missing a bet . - What do you mean ? Supposing you was an ignorant Kafiri who would you rather follow , a god or a man ? Now , we 're here to conquer this country , ai n't we ? Well , with you as a god , it would take half
zone1	a bit blasphemous like . No , Danny blaspheming is when you take his name in vain God Almighty 's . What if they found out we was having them on ? Why should they ? We wo n't tell them . - You wo n't tell them , will you , Billy ? - Oh , no . indeed , by Jove , no . Polo . Polo . Er-Heb and Bashkai celebrate new brotherhood . - With whose head ? - Ootah 's . We marched and fought and took more villages . Our ranks swelled . They were well trained , but with Danny at their head , Sikander the Second they were also inspired . Sikander ! Sikander ! After half a dozen victories , his fame was such that the fighting stopped . We was met with gifts and bevies of maidens who danced and threw flowers . Girl . Venus de Milo in the flesh , if flesh it is and not Guinness and champagne . Billy tell her to stand up and turn around . Just gazing , Peachy . Just gazing .
zone1	human , one thing leads to another . Give her a hat with a feather , and no girl in Brighton on bank holiday could hold a candle to her . I must admit she really is an eyef ul . What 's your name , girl ? - Roxanne . - Roxanne . Here . Was n't that the name of the princess Alexander married ? It was that . Hold your head up . - Girl af raid . - Of what ? If god takes a girl , she catches fire and go up in smoke . - They do what ? - God 's heart , a burning torch . His veins run fire , not blood . If god makes love to girl she goes : In one flash . Not even ashes left . I bet a jealous goddess made that up . They come from Sikandergul with a message for son of Sikander . They 're looking at him , if they opened their eyes . - The message 's from Kaf u Selim . - Who ? Kaf u Selim , high
zone1	u Selim says come . Come ? - ls that all ? - That 's all , just come . Does n't waste words , does he ? Tell him we appreciate the invitation . We 'll avail ourselves of it ... - ... one of these days . - No . Come means " now . " What does he want to see us about ? He just says come . I see . All right , tell him to stand by and the army will be ready by first light . He says , " No ! You come alone , him and you . " Without the army ? Tell him Peachy and me do n't go anywhere without the army goes with us . Shut up , Danny . We have to go . Have you gone starky ? Keep your voice down and put a smile on your face , we 've got an audience . We 'd be stone bonkers to walk into a strange city by our lonesomes . Either we do what they say or pull stumps and run . Make a
zone1	? Not bloody likely . Run from them ? No from our blokes . We 're over a barrel , Danny . If we back away from a meeting with old Kaf u Selim , we 'll lose face and that is the one thing a god can not afford . What to do ? Bluff it out . Polish our buttons , stuff ramrods up our jacksies and look bold . Like we did when we were on charges for drunk and resisting the guard . - Sikandergul . - God 's holy trousers ! No weapons allowed in Holy City . All right you got us here . Now what ? Where 's your high panjandrum ? Afternoon , Your Reverence . You wanted to see me ? Tell him he can keep it . I 'm making him a present of it . - What did he say ? - He say , " Now we shall see . " You mortals wait down there . Tell them to take their paws off me double quick or I 'll have their guts for garters ! I 'll
zone1	How dare you lay your hands on me , Daniel Dravot , Esquire ! Sikander ! Now what the bleeding hell ? One minute he 's about to cut my heart out next minute he 's flat on his face ! He saw that ... - ... and dropped like he was poleax ed ! - What do you make of it ? He says that is mark of Sikander . They 're Masons ! By the square , level , plumb rule , compasses , the all-seeing eye ! The craft , Danny ! - That 's what saved us . - Blimey . Only highest priest knows about this sign put in stone long ago by Sikander . Now , Kaf u Selim rejoicing at the coming of his son . It ai n't brass , Danny . - Sikander ? - Belonged to him , now son of Sikander 's . These here make jewels in the Tower of London look like cheap family heirlooms . God 's holy trousers ! Look at the size of that ruby ! There 's a bigger one . Why ,
zone1	out of here to be millionaires . And all of it , all would make us the two richest men in England ! - The empire . - The world . But will they let us take it ? Take it away , I mean . Ask him , Billy . He says , belong to son of Sikander . Can do with it what he likes . Leave it here , take away , no matter . His will be done . We 've mules enough , and riflemen to guard them when the time comes . What month is it ? January , I make it or maybe February . March , April , May , June four months of winter monsoon , then ... . Four long months ! What 'll we do with the time ? Add up our blessings here divide them by two not forgetting you , Billy . And multiply that by the years we got left . Tell His Reverence he has my thanks for discharging his trust so correctly and delivering to me what is mine . And tell him I
zone1	who waited for me , from one generation to another down the centuries to this present day and fortuitous occasion . My lord , these people are from village of Kamdesh . This man owns 60 cows . All cows in the village . - Very enterprising of him . - Enterprise is not his , it is hers . She 's his wife . Every time he catches her with other man other man has to pay six cows . Kafiri custom . Use other man 's wife , pay him six cows . He 's piled up a fortune of 60 cows ... - ... out of her infidelities ? - And 32 goats . She ai n't a wife . She 's a going concern ! And these are the unfaithf ul husbands and these the wives ? Those four , wives of one man . These three , wives of another . This ai n't no laughing matter ! No cattle , there ai n't meat nor hides . No milk , there ai n't butter or cheese and the children 's bowls go empty .
zone1	his wife to comport herself like Jezebel one cow shall be paid each of the other wives . For using a good law for a bad purpose , another . For causing the young to go without , a third . For thinking he can get away with it , a fourth . He shall pay 22 cases of compensation of four cows to each wife . Which means , she 's got ... - Fourteen and two-thirds . - ... more infidelities to commit to come out even . Let 's see how he likes it when she earns cows for others . Next case . - What 's the charge ? - No charge . This chief from Agatsi which village have fire and supply of grains go up in smoke . He want permission to raid another village for to steal grain . They do n't have to raid and they wo n't starve . Make a proclamation . - What number is it ? - Thirty-one , my lord . Each village will bring one-tenth of its crop here to my royal city of Sikandergul where
zone1	from privation shall have grain issued in accordance with its needs . I now pronounce this law enacted . Selah . I pronounce a recess in this durbar . - Yes , my lord . - Peachy . If we 're gon na make it stick that I 'm a god you ought to bow when you pass in f ront of me like everybody else . - All right , Danny . - Understand ? - For appearances ' sake . - Yeah . - No offense ? - No , no , of course not , Danny . You have to take your hat off to Daniel Dravot . He dealt out justice as though he wrote the book . Peachy was general of his armies , but there was no more battles to fight . Danny had him build a bridge that would span the chasm below the Holy City . It 'd help keep Peachy occupied until the spring came . Look , Danny , the geese . Skeins of them flying north . A fortnight and the pass will open . What we ought to
zone1	wait on the weather . - l ai n't going , Peachy . - What ? - You heard me . - Not going ? Correct . Have you gone barmy ? No , I ai n't been drinking neither . I see things clear . It 's like bandages have been removed from my eyes . Have you ever walked into a strange room and it 's like you 've been there before ? - l know what you mean . - Let me tell you something . This is n't the first time I 've worn a crown . There 's more to this than meets the eye . It all adds up . What does ? Everything that 's happened from the time we decided to come here . No , before that beginning with your taking Brother Kipling 's watch . More than chance has been at work here . More than mere chance . Why his watch and not somebody else 's ? And what made him give me the emblem ? One thing after the other . The avalanche , the arrow the mark
zone1	Roxanne . - Roxanne ? The Venus de Milo ? The same . One more thing is needf ul for my destiny to be f ulfilled . - l take her to wife . - Leave the women alone . Who 's talking women ? I said wife . - A queen to breed a king 's son . - And the contract ? The contract lasted until we was kings , and king I 've been for months ! The first king since Alexander , the first to wear his crown in 2200 and ... - 14 . - ... 14 years ! Him and now me ! They call me his son and I am in spirit anyway . It 's a hugeous responsibility . The bridge is the first of many . They 'll tie the country together . A nation I shall make of it with an anthem and a flag . I shall treat on equal terms the viceroy and other kings and princes . When I 've accomplished what I set out to do , I 'll stand before the queen not kneel ,
zone1	'll say : " Please accept the Order of the Garter as a mark of my esteem , cousin . " She 'll pin it on me herself . It 's big . I tell you , it 's big ! And I tell you , you need a physic ! I 'm fair disappointed in you . You , who followed me and helped make me what I am . Followed you , me ? Who had hold of the mule 's tail , tell me that ? The jenny also done her bit . Danny ! We 've had this rare streak of luck . Let 's quit winners for once . - Cut and run while the running 's good . - You call it luck . I call it destiny . Ha , ha ! Pardon me while I fall down laughing . Whatever you may think and however you may feel , I 'm a king and you 're a subject ! So do n't you provoke me , Peachy Carnehan ! Or you 'll do what ? You 've got me trembling in my
zone1	have permission to bugger off ! - l will , with or without your bleeding permission ! And may you rot in hell , Daniel Dravot ! From Sikander the First to the Second was a long time between kings and a country needs a king like a king needs a crown . One is the glory of the other . Therefore , I shall leave a son behind who will in turn beget other sons so the succession will be unbroken and kings will be guaranteed forever . To which end I have chosen a wife . Roxanne of Khawak . Let her be brought here attended by her family . I want flowers strewed along her way . The wedding ceremony will be surrounded by pomp and circumstance ! Let messengers be sent forth and summon my people from near and far . Selah . What are they saying ? How can daughters of men marry gods or devils ? - A god can do anything . - But it is not proper . - Who says it is n't ? - All the priests . Would they
zone1	say let lmbra decide . imbra is highest god of all . And what if lmbra should hold against me ? What 'll they do about it ? Am I a dog or a god ? Have n't I put the shadow of my hand over this country ? Do as I say ! Send for the girl ! Tell them that 's an order ! - Well , Billy , what 's going on ? - Signs very bad , Peachy . Priests open up birds , green inside and stinking horrid . lmbra very angry . They probably cut the spleen . The green 's only bile . Do n't worry , Billy , the girl wo n't go up in smoke . I 'll guarantee you that . Girl do n't matter . Many girls here , no difference . Few girls more or less but cows now , they dry up and goats throw babies too soon . And corn do not ripen . Everybody go hungry . Now , Billy , you know as well as I do that Dravot 's no god . He
zone1	must be mistaken about lmbra . He not angry because god marrying a mortal but because son of man pretend to be a god . Roxanne , do n't be af raid I would n't harm you . When the time comes , you 'll catch fire , I warrant . All women should when their husbands hold them . But you wo n't perish , girl , I promise you that . Well , Danny the time has come , as the saying goes . When do you leave ? At first light . I thought you might look in the box es before I nail them shut . - See what I 'm taking . - Take what you like . I weighed the gold out , pound for pound . The gems , ounce for ounce . Right . I 'll only need half the mules we planned . I 'd like to take 20 riflemen to be safe through the Khyber Pass . Take them . Take them . God 's holy trousers ! What is that ? They 're savages here , one and all
zone1	heads and pissing on their neighbours . Please , Danny for the last time of asking ... For the last time of answering , I wo n't . I know you 've got my best interest at heart but the choice has been made . Well , I 'll be seeing you , then ? In London maybe when the queen gives you the Order of the Garter . - Peachy . - Yes , Danny ? I 'll be married midmorning . Could you not wait and leave afterwards ? See me up the aisle for old times ' sake ? If you like . Peachy , the ring . I , Sikander the Second , hereby take thee Roxanne , to be my lawf ul wedded wife and queen of Kafiristan . Selah . She bit me ! The slut bit me ! What 's he saying ? Danny 's bleeding , they know ! He says , " Not god , not devil , but man ! " They 've twigged it , Danny . You 've had it ! The jig 's up ! - l
zone1	've got to brass it out , Danny . Danny , brass it out ! Bags of swank . We 'll get your riflemen and come back and slaughter the dogs ! A drenching in their own blood we 'll give them ! Prepare to advance ! Too many for that , Danny . Retire in sections . Retire ? Retire be damned ! We 've got ta make a run for it ! Front section fire ! Back ! Front rank , fire ! Break ranks ! Mount the mule and ride ! There 's a chance you 'll make it . Gurkha foot soldier , not cavalry . Rifleman Machendra Bahadur Gurung wishing you many good lucks . Out of bloody ammo ! Me too ! I 'm heartily ashamed for getting you killed instead of going home rich on account of me being so bleeding high and bloody mighty ! Can you forgive me ? That I can , and that I do , Danny . Free and f ull and without let or hindrance . Everything 's all right , then . Cut , you buggers
zone1	and round and round like a penny whirligig . Twenty thousand miles ! It took him half an hour to fall before he struck the rocks . And do you know what they did to Peachy ? They crucified him , sir between two pine trees as Peachy 's hands will show . Poor Peachy , who 'd never done them any harm . He just hung there and he screamed , but he did n't die . The next day they came and took him down and said it 's a miracle he was n't dead and they let him go . And Peachy come home in about a year and the mountains they tried to fall on old Peachy but he was quite safe because Daniel walked before him . And Daniel never let go of Peachy 's hand . And Peachy never let go of Daniel 's head . His head ? You knew Danny , sir . Oh , yes . You knew most worshipf ul Brother Daniel Dravot , Esquire . Well he became the king of Kafiristan with a crown on his head .

zone1	and I sure as hell ai n't putting ' up a red cent for their soul . All right , Malloy . You never paid for it , and I never gave it away . With me , anybody who wants a little " mmmph , " he 's got ta put up for it . - So it 's a Mexican standoff . - Right . - No hard feelings ? - Did n't waste nothin ' but time . Help yourself to a sandwich and go . - I 'm not hungry . - Suit yourself . Could you freshen up kinda fast ? It 's gettin ' late . You know what I mean ? Yeah , I know what you mean .

Why do n't we finish this stuff and get on with the evening ? Ma certainmente , mon cherie . Which is French for , uh -- - Whatever . - Whatever . Okay . [EXHALES] Ooh , Dirtwater . It 's just so kind of you to let me do this . The old noblesse . But you 've got kindness written all over your face . Kindness ... generosity -- And charm . Boyish charm .

Have you any special subjects you like to teach ? Well ... I have several specialties . But I 'm not sure I should teach them all to the kids . [CLEARS_THROAT] But , um , I like-- I like singing . Would you care to teach the children one of your favorites ? Now ? Just to see how it goes . They do love music . Well , uh ... there 's a little nursery ditty my grandmama , the Marchioness of Pillsbury ... used to sing to me in my crib . You see , children , in this story ... the royal gardener was very proud of his fruit trees . But he was particularly anxious ... that no harm
zone1	the little princes and princesses would often come to visit ... he would say -- D-- Does anyone here play the piano ? Would you mind ? Thank you . Uh , C-sharp , I think . So , the gardener would often say ... [MOANS_QUIETLY] Very good , my dear . Very good indeed .

They do inspire me so , sir . - May I ? - Oh , please . - May I ? - Please . Yes , you certainly do have a way with children , Duchess . Uh , now , as to the matter of salary -- Oh , anything you say will be all right ... as long as I have an hour off a day to read the good book ... say my prayers and do my nails .

Oh , no . There 's one stop in Virginia City . Quite all right . I have my reading to occupy my time . Oh , dear . Oh ! Uh -- An ... Indian prayer shawl .

zone1	that line . Oh , yes . Oosh . We usually say it when the intruder is gaining on the fox . Stop the stagecoach ! And we seem to have an intruder gaining on this little pack this very moment . We 'd best not take any chances with this piece of oosh . Oh , uh , do n't do that , ma'am , no . Mormons never kill . That 's why there 's so many of the little buggers . Yes ! Hey , wait a minute ! My life 's in danger ! Let me aboard ! Wait up ! Stop the stagecoach ! - Hey !

He went into the Institute for a rest and has been a virtual prisoner ever since . Frankly , Doctor , I fear for his life . Miss Brisbane , I assure you I am a competent psychiatrist . I 've examined your father and I must tell you , in my professional capacity he is deeply disturbed . [Knock_on_door] Do n't answer it . If they know I 'm here , they 'll harm my father .

Fellow members of the American Psychiatric Convention it is a pleasure and an honor to present the new head of the Psycho-Neurotic Institute for the Very , Very Nervous . Winner of the Nobel
zone1	severe psychosis . The distinguished Dr . Richard H . Thorndyke . Thank you , Dr . Colburn . Fellow analysts , psychiatrists psychologists and laypeople today I would like to discuss some of the lesser known aspects of Psychobiological Therapy . 100 years ago , psychology was akin to witchcraft . But some of these great people , these giants behind me gave us a nice living . KILLER : I do n't know what they said . I only know that they met . What do you want me to do ? Kill him ? If you want me to kill him , I 'll kill him . I do n't have to kill him , but I 'd like to kill him . I killed Ashley and Wentworth . Another killing or two wo n't make any difference .

That each patient is a supreme individual endowed with those qualities that distinguish the human being from the slime from which he emerged . Thank you . THORNDYKE : Yes , Dr . Colburn . COLBURN : May I ask you a question ? THORNDYKE : Certainly . Dr . Thorndyke , you mentioned in your address that penis envy should be deemed an antiquated psychiatric concept . Could you expand on that ? THORNDYKE : Of course . Let 's remember that the term " penis envy " was created in a predominantly male atmosphere ... MAN : Excuse me . Sorry I 'm late . Forgive me for bringing the kids . I could n't get a sitter . THORNDYKE : Please , have a seat . As I was saying , in a world of predominantly male-oriented psychology it was only natural to arrive at the term , pee ... Pee ... " Peepee
zone1	validity to peepee envy ? It has no more validity than if a man envied a woman 's balloons . Dr . Thorndyke , do you feel that the trauma of toilet training has a bearing on the sexual future of the adolescent ? Toilet training . That 's a vast area . Let 's be more specific . Are we talking about number one or cocky-doody ? For argument 's sake , let 's say cocky-doody . THORNDYKE : I 'd say professionally , cocky-doody has very little to do with the future sexual development of the adolescent . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Let me backtrack for a second . The female erogenous zone . - You mean the balloons ? - No . Lower , much lower . Where the babies come out . The woowoo . The woowoo ? THORNDYKE : Yes . The woowoo .

There is the attempt by outside power to divide Africa ... into hostile blocks . And there is the need of African nations to achieve progress . And there is the need of African nations to achieve progress . How far to Manila ? We are 20 km from Manila . Kidlat , who would you want to meet most in America ? In America I would like to meet Wernher von Braun . The man who built the bridge to the moon . Kidlat , why do you admire America so much ? Because in America I could become an astronaut . Here , I am only a jeepney driver . All these bright-colored taxis , where do they come from ? These are vehicles of war which we made into vehicles
zone1	Filipino car manufacturer . Despite the oil crisis , Sarao increased car production by 20% from last year . Today , Sarao rolls out five jeepneys per week . An old jeepney never dies . It finds its way into a hundred new jeepneys . Kidlat . Kidlat , I want to bring a Philippine- made jeepney with me when I leave . I think ... I might just bring a Philippines chauffeur along . Alma , look what I brought you ! An Americano gave me dollars . Alma , you are the master of your vehicle . Only you can tell it where to go . So , Kidlat , you go with the Americano ? You 're like your father . Fascinated by the white man 's smile . Do not worry , Mama . I will become rich in America ... and I will take you away from here . Kidlat , your father was a happy taxi driver . He always sang as he worked . One day , a smiling stranger gave him a rifle . " The bridge to your freedom ... "
zone1	help you in your revolution against the Spanish tyrants . " Said the smiling Americano . Your father stopped singing . He fought in the revolution and the days of the Spaniards were numbered . When the Spaniards surrendered , your father sang again . As he sang the sweet song of victory , the Americans were buying us in Paris . Your singing father tried to enter liberated Manila at the San Juan bridge . He was stopped by an American sentry . It was his last song . From the butt of your father 's rifle I carved this horse . " Killed for trespassing on US property " . Was the military report attached to his corpse . For twelve million dollars we became US military property . Yes , Kidlat . For twelve million dollars they bought your soul and mine . That was the official military version ... of your father 's death . The facts are suppressed to hide our true strength . Kidlat , it 's time you know the truth . I was there . I saw it all happen . He

Kidlat , when the typhoon blows off ... its cocoon , the butterfly embraces the sun . The sleeping typhoon must learn to blow again . Kaya , I now recall . I first saw the white carabao somewhere here . Many years ago , on the day that I became a man . Leandro was the first to volunteer . I was no hero . My balls jingled like ice cream bells . Hermes had a hard time . My best friend Eric went through it quietly . When your best friend goes through hell , it is difficult to remain behind . My turn came next . At the end of the day , five of us had become men . While they were hammering at me ... I could not take my eyes off a strange leafless tree . The white carabao stared so coldly I felt no pain .
zone1	. He takes me to Paris , where his business is . He said we stay there for a year and then we go to New York . I need six passport photos . Passport ? I do n't know what 's a passport . He just said six passport photos . I must thank the Virgin Mary . I will push my jeepney all day . O holy Mary ! Thank you for granting my prayers ! Forgive me for not beating myself as in previous years . We leave on Sunday , my wounds would not heal on time . Kidlat , stop apologizing ! You know my job here is a bore . But there are a few among you who make my day . Like Anselmo , the ice cream man . Every year he likes to play my son with his cast of thousands . A real superstar ! Then there is Giorgio , the biggest sinner in town . Even with his mask , who would n't recognize him ? And then there is Clara , vowing annually to give up coconut sweets .
zone1	wow ! The chains flip her appetite . And you , dear Kidlat . Remember the first year you wanted to fly ? Can I forget that at five years you started using the chains ... praying for a toy jet plane ? And last year the thread mask - how sexy ! That year you fell from the mango tree and broke your back ? You locked yourself in the ice factory . When they pulled you out , you were as hard as Judas ' prick . Kidlat , you 're okay in my book . See you in Lourdes , huh ? Children ! Concentrate ! Last day of practice ... One , two , three , four ... Kidlat ... take this horse on your travels . One day you might need him to help you find the path to freedom . Thank you beloved friends of Balian . I can only promise you , when I become rich in America ... I will donate a traffic light for our bridge ! Sir , your jeep awaits you at the customs zone . Sir , upon
zone1	France . Do you have anything to declare ? Come , Kidlat . Come . One .. two ... three ... four , five , six bridges ! Bridges ! Bridges , bridges ! Everywhere bridges ! Dearest Mama , I arrived safely in Paris . You can not imagine what world lies out here . Floors walk for you ! Doors open for you ! And so many bridges ... Do you know Paris has 26 bridges ? Why ca n't we have progress like this ? Your loving son , Kidlat . Chateau de la France was once surrounded by beautiful woods . Today , it 's a bit different . Kidlat , you will live in the North tower . This is your room , Kidlat . Unbelievable ! In that small room were enough things to fill up five bamboo huts ! Let me show you the splendid sights of my Paris . On this side is the Sacr ? Coeur . I have 340 machines in that area . Uh ... 341 . Over here , the Eiffel Tower . You ca n't see the
zone1	675 machines . That 's Montparnasse , the tallest building of Paris . 425 machines . Quartier Latin : 543 . Bastille : That 's the communist quartier ! I have no machines there . And for your stay here , I present you a welcome gift . A pocket camera and transistor radio combined . In case you ever get homesick . This button gives you American language broadcasts . You begin working tomorrow . Ah ! How wonderful to be in paradise . If only my friends could see me here ! If only I had a friend . Huh ? Two yolks ? Again ? Incredible ! Six eggs ... Twelve yolks ! I went back to the vendor to ask why all the eggs had double yolks . " All my eggs have the same grandfather " , she said . " Today , everybody gets cheap synthetic eggs from that supermarket . " " We are the last merchants of the Four Seasons " . I looked at the supermarket and I was frightened . I told Lola my mother carved a horse to remember
zone1	is wise to know ... " a simple tribute is more powerful ... " than the giant monuments of our civilization " . Dear members of the Wernher von Braun Club : Thank you for sending me the annual report of the club . I think of you often , and I miss our noisy meetings . I am happy to hear the club sold 5000 ice cream cones last month . To make the last money needed for your Space Day fiesta . I am sure it will be a big success . Thank you also for designating me honorary chairman of the beauty contest . I regret that I can not be there to escort ... your selected Queen of Progress . But I will be there in spirit . The project should be ready in time for the landing of the Viking on Mars . Do not worry if the statue does not look like our hero . As long as it faces Cape Canaveral . America is not far away , Kidlat , if you work faster . I 've worked a lifetime to build my

And one day , the army jeeps and jets . Progress , my boy . Progress ! I practice my French every day , in the streets . Today I got my first French kiss . Bretons give four kisses ... Alsatians give three . Lola gives me seven French kisses . Lola was worried . She spoke of a bad dream . Kidlat , I fear it is my last season . We told Coco , the cherry vendor , of Lola 's bad dream . When I joked about Lola 's phantom , Coco scolded me . " Kidlat , Lola 's nightmare is no joke " . What would you do if you were the last merchant of the Four Seasons ... and someone took your goods from you ? Do not worry , Lola . We 'll fight all the egg phantoms together . My first vacation ! The boss
zone1	to the land of Wernher von Braun . There was this pregnant Bavarian girl . She taught me a German word . " Zwiebel " . " Onion " . " Zwiebelturm " . " Onion tower " . " That Zwiebelturm goes up on Sunday " , she said . When I told them my jeep was made by hand they all became sad . " This is the last handcrafted Zwiebelturm " , said one old man . " The next Zwiebelturms will be factory-made " . Five ready-made Zwiebelturms per hour . How strange ! I could not understand how these old men ... could be so sentimental about the old technologies . As that seven-ton onion lifted so easily into the sky ... I felt proud to be president of the Wernher von Braun club . When I left Germany ... the first Kidlat on this side of the planet had been born . Funny , I thought the baby looked a little bit like me . Driving home on the German autobahn ... with little Kidlat in my mind ... The jeep went faster ,
zone1	... and lighter , and lighter ! What a nice feeling ! When I got to Paris the supermarket had grown two blocks longer . Stop crying , Kidlat ! Stop crying like a baby ! One market vendor less means one parking space more . Progress , my boy . The ghost of progress visited us . Dear Kidlat , how are you ? Do you remember the forest where you became a man ? The government razed down the trees ... to make way for a new highway for tourists . Who will stop this madness ? Viking I has landed on the surface of Mars . Yesterday I helped your mother move her house . We walked all day . But no matter how far we walked it was never far enough . Everywhere we went ... we could not avoid the planter of new forest . Kidlat , one day you will come to know ... the quiet strength of bamboo . " Quiet strength of bamboo " . That is why we have no progress ! Kaya , you still refuse to see why bamboo

Those are super chimneys for burning the garbage of Paris . An extra service of the supermarket . Ten super chimneys , Kidlat . Made of plastic quickly assembled . And too close to my chateau for comfort ! We must leave Paris before those chimneys start spitting smoke . Incredible ! Inside a chimney was enough room for three families ! Imagine , thirty people living in each chimney ! Three hundred people . That 's half of my village ! Today , world leaders started arriving in Paris ... for the inauguration of the supermarket . The big question is : Who will be Miss Supermarket of 1976 ? I 've sold the chewing gum business ! That 's the last machine you load . You can keep your favorite chewing gum machine ... for a souvenir . I went to my favorite chewing gum machine . I found her
zone1	You will meet them at my farewell party tomorrow . Men more godly than your Wernher von Braun . Right after the party we fly to America ! On the Concorde . You will be the first Filipino to fly supersonic . Tomorrow , Kidlat , tomorrow ! You shall be with me in paradise ! Paradise . Will it be the paradise I prayed for ? Will it be the paradise I dreamed of ? Congratulations , children of the fatherland ! The day of glory has arrived ! Liberty ! Equality ! Brotherhood ! Supermarket ! Do n't get too impressed , Kidlat . Wait until America . Where everything is even more super ! If the small chimneys work , why the super chimneys ? If the small markets work , why supermarkets ? If small airplanes work ... Why super flying machines ? Aha ! My friends arriving . Come , Kidlat . Meet my friends . Big personalities you hear on your little radio ... in the Philippines . Why is everybody staring at me ? I feel I 'm becoming smaller . Kidlat ...
zone1	Tahimik . I am not as small as you think . Nothing can stop me from crossing my bridge ! When the typhoon blows off its cocoon ... the butterfly embraces the sun . This is the last will and testament of Kidlat Tahimik . And a declaration of independence . I , Kidlat Tahimik , of my own free will ... hereby resign as president of the Wernher von Braun Club . And relinquish all rights and duties as president and founder of the club . Furthermore , I totally resign my membership from the club . This resignation is absolute irrevocable . And is effective now . I declare myself independent ... from those who would build bridges to the stars . Where is your truest friend , Kidlat ? Where is your real strength ? The sleeping typhoon must learn to blow again . I am Kidlat Tahimik . I choose my vehicle . I choose my bridge .

This one has a remote control . Maybe there 's another gum machine someplace . You see ? This is my bed . This is my bathroom . This is my sink . This is my toilet . This is my bathtub . Here is my closet . You have a very handsome wardrobe . Yes . I 'm allowed to go to the attic and wear any of the old man 's clothes . - They fit me very well , do n't they ? - Yes . It 's amazing how those clothes have come back into style . Why is the bed like this ? I like to sleep with my head facing the north . I sleep better that way . Yes , I 've heard about that .

Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital . - Thank you . - Can I help you to the table , Mr . Gardiner ? Thank you . I feel very good in here . That 's the oxygen .

The businessman today is at the mercy of kid lawyers from the SEC . It 's happening to everyone , I 'm afraid . The way things are going , they 'll probably legislate the medical profession right out of existence . Yes . Right out of existence . Yeah , it 's a damn shame . What are your plans now , Mr .

He works on flinty soil to make it productive with the labor of his own hands . He waters it with the sweat of his own brow . He makes a thing of value for his family and for the community . Yes , indeed , Chauncey , a productive businessman is a laborer in the vineyard . I know exactly what you mean . The garden that I left was such a place . I do n't have that anymore . All I have left is the room upstairs . Come on , now , wait a minute , Chauncey . You 've got your health . For God 's sake , man , you ca n't let those bastards get you down . You 've got to fight .

After all , they 're our strongest defense against the pollutants of our basic freedoms as well as the well-being of our middle class . I 've been thinking about starting a financial assistance fund . Tell me , would you have any ideas on that subject ? No , Ben . Reluctant to speak , eh ? I can understand that . After a man 's lost everything anger tends to block out rationality , for a while . But , you work on the idea . Water it . Fertilize it . I will , Ben . Yes .

It 's very precise , sir . It 's 10:00 . Thank you , Jim . Mrs . Aubrey , the President is arriving . - Up and around this morning , are you ? - I like to walk , Ben . That 's good news , my boy . You look much better today . It 's all make-up . I asked Nurse Teresa to fix me up a bit . I did n't want the President to think I would die while he was talking to me . I see . Nobody likes a dying man . Because nobody knows what death is . You seem to be an exception . That 's one of the things I admire about you , your admirable balance . You seem to be a truly peaceful man . Thank you , Ben . Thank you .
zone1	. Rand , the President is arriving . Just show the President into the library . We 'll be along in a few minutes . An old habit that goes along with power : Keep them waiting . Not now , Arthur . But , sir ... I 'm going to meet the President on my own two feet . Shall we go ? That 's a very good idea . When I was younger , I had thoughts of public office . But I found that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen . Of course , my wealth provided me with considerable influence . But I 've tried , believe me , I 've tried not to misuse that power . It 's extremely important that we do n't allow ourselves to become blinded to the needs of our government no matter how strong the temptation . I 've been labeled a kingmaker but I 've tried to keep myself open to the voice of the people . And I 've remained honest to myself . That 's the main thing . - Good morning
zone1	. Where the hell is he ? Mr . President . Ben . It 's good to see you . You look terrific . Thank you , Mr . President . Your visit has helped to raise my spirits . I 've missed you , my friend . Come , sit down . Take a load off your feet . Hello , Mr . President . Hello . I want you to meet my very dear friend , Mr . Chauncey Gardiner . On television , Mr . President , you look much smaller . I must warn you , Chauncey 's not a man to bandy words . Oh ? Really ? Well , Mr . Gardiner , I 'm a man who appreciates a frank discussion . - Would you be seated ? - Yes , I will . - Ben , I was wondering if you had a chance ... - Yes ? - Did you happen to have a chance to go ... - Yes ? Ben , did you read my speech ? Overall , pretty good . But I think , Mr . President
zone1	temporary measures at a time like this . Ben , I mean ... I sympathize with you and I know how difficult it is to be straightforward . But I 'll tell you right now , Bobby ... - Hi . - Hi . I 'm Riff . Secret Service . Good . Of course . What you 're saying , Ben , is that you do n't think I should take the chance . - Absolutely not . Do you agree with Ben , or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives ? As long as the roots are not severed all is well . And all will be well in the garden . - In the garden ? - Yes . In a garden , growth has its season . First comes spring and summer but then we have fall and winter . And then we get spring and summer again . - Spring and summer ? - Yes . - And fall and winter ? - Yes . I think what our insightful young friend is saying is that we welcome the inevitable seasons
zone1	our economy . Yes . There will be growth in the spring . I must admit , that is one of the most refreshing and optimistic statements I 've heard in a very long time . I admire your good , solid sense . That 's precisely what we lack on Capitol Hill . I must be going . - This visit has been most enlightening . - Yes , it has . And Ben , thank you for your time and thought . Oh , nonsense . Thank you for taking time out with a dying man . No , I wo n't have any of that . Why do n't you listen to your friend Chauncey ? This is a time to think of life . That 's right , Mr . President . Now , you take care , Ben . And you take care , too , Bobby . Chauncey . Bobby . He 's a decent fellow , is n't he , the President ? Yes . I 'm glad he came . Kaufman , I 'll need some information on Chauncey Gardiner 's background
zone1	I 'd like it sometime today . No problem , chief . You know you do n't play games with words to protect yourself . No , you 're direct . Do you remember what I was talking to you about last night ? - No . - Sure you do . My plan for financial assistance to businessmen . I think you 're just the man to take charge of an institution like that . I understand . I know you 're not a man to act on the spur of the moment so do n't feel that you have to rush into a decision . Thank you . Now , I 'm afraid I must excuse myself . I 'm awfully tired . I 'm sorry you 're so sick . We have 60,000 tulip bulbs up there . It is so glorious when they bloom . Of course , the roses are my favorites . We have 20,000 rose bushes . And over here , we plant something different every year . I have n't quite decided what we 'll plant this year . And that 's
zone1	. I like to watch the young plants grow . - It 's wonderful , is n't it ? - Yes . Young plants do much better if a person helps them . You know Ben told me that the President was very taken with you this morning . Last night you mentioned an old man that died . You must 've been very close to him . I was . Yes . I 'm sorry . You mentioned also that Louise had gone , also . Were you very close to Louise ? Yes , I liked Louise very much . She was his maid . - Oh , his maid . - Yes . I see . So stupid of me . I thought maybe she was perhaps someone you were romantically involved with or maybe a sister . No . She used to bring me my meals . She was very kind to me . Chauncey Gardiner , Mr . Rand 's friend and advisor , was at the meeting this morning . I found Mr . Gardiner to have a feeling for this country that we
zone1	a most intuitive man : " As long as the roots of industry remain firmly planted in the national soil ... " ... the economic prospects are undoubtedly sunny . " - What is it ? - Doctor . Decoral . Five milligrams . Now , I know that many of you ... Put your arms up . I think you 'd better leave , Eve . - Will he be okay ? - He 'll be fine . Yeah , we got you , Ben . Come on , Chauncey . But I have decided there are no temporary stopgaps . So I 'm going to rethink my position and find another solution . You 'll be very pleased to know that your founder and Chairman of the Board Mr . Benjamin Turnbull Rand , agrees with me on this for once . Gentlemen , let us not fear the inevitable chill and storms of autumn and winter . Instead , let us anticipate the rapid growth of springtime . Let us await the rewards of summer . As in a garden of the earth , let us learn
zone1	bare as well as the times when we pick the fruit . I 'm just so very grateful that you 're here with us . So am I , Eve . It 's been an exhausting day for Ben . He 's resting now , and there 's no cause for alarm . I have a telephone call for you . Telephone call ? Yes . Sidney Courtney , the financial editor of the Washington Post . Would you care to take it , sir ? Yes . In my office . Go , I 'll be just fine . Yes , you 'll be fine . He 's such a kind and sensitive man . Do n't you think ? - He 's not there . - Not there ? Mr . Courtney , are you there ? Yes , he 's there . Where is he ? There or here ? He 's on both lines . Are you there ? Yes , I 'm here . Hello , Mr . Gardiner . I saw the President 's speech at the Financial Institute today . Would you care
zone1	the President and yourself ? Yes . It was very nice meeting the President . What we 'd like to know are some facts . Such as , what is the exact relationship between yourself and the First American Financial Corporation ? I think you should ask Mr . Rand that . Well , yes , sir . But Mr . Rand is ill , so I 'm taking the liberty of asking you . What ? Say that again . I said that since Mr . Rand is ill , I 'm taking the liberty of asking you . Yes , you are . You should ask Mr . Rand that . Of course . Just one quick question , Mr . Gardiner ... Will you hold a minute , please ? I have the producer of The Gary Burns Show on the line . Yes , I have watched that show . Of course . They would like you to appear on the show tonight . The Vice President was scheduled , but he had to cancel . They asked if you would be interested . Yes .
zone1	Mr . Hull ? Mr . Gardiner has agreed to do the show . He 's been on television . Yes . The show will be taped , and then shown at 10:00 but he 's to be there ... What do you mean , he 's got no background ? That 's impossible . I quoted the man on national television . He 's a very well-known man . We 're well aware of that , sir ... He 's a close friend and advisor of Benjamin Rand . For Christ 's sakes , we 've got volumes of data on Rand . I plan to contact Mr . Rand the minute ... I do not want Ben disturbed . We have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man . Use any agencies that are necessary to get a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner . Have it in my office , tomorrow at 7:00 . - I 've got to take a leak . - Right , chief . Of course , your position in the financial community carries a lot of weight . But
zone1	I see . Do you realize more people will be watching you tonight than all those that have seen theater plays in the last 40 years ? - Yes ? - Yes . Why ? Hell , I do n't know . Good . - This way . - Thank you . Gardiner 's laconic . He plays his cards very close to the chest and the scuttlebutt is he 's a strong candidate for a seat on the board of First American Financial . Kinney , what have you found on his background ? Nothing . Yeah , skip the levity . I know it 's ridiculous , but there is no information about Gardiner . We have no material on him . Zilch . Here . I want your shoulders to go right on this pad . Now , wait , you have to put your head through the hole first . Head in the hole . That 's right . Okay . Stretch your legs out , push your body ... Thought you might need this about now . It gets pretty hot underneath these lights .
zone1	wants to interrupt you , or ask you a question he 'll lift his left forefinger to his left eyebrow . All right ? - I understand . - Good . - Thank you . - You 're very welcome . - Nurse Teresa did Ben 's make-up . - Really ? - Did she do a good job ? - Yes , it looked just like this . - Looks like you 're up . - I am ? - Gary 's ready for you now . - Yes . - Good luck . - Good luck . This way . How very nice to have you with us this evening , Mr . Gardiner . Hello , Gary . This is Miss Annie Lawson . Mr . Chauncey Gardiner . - Hi . How do you do ? - Hello . I 'd like very much to thank you for joining us on such short notice and filling in for the Vice President . Yes . It 's always somewhat surprising to find men like yourself working so intimately with the President , and yet somehow managing to
zone1	Yes , of course . Your anonymity is certainly likely to be a thing of the past from now on . Good . I assume , since the President quoted you that you 're inclined to agree with his view of the economy . Which view ? The President compared the economy of this country to a garden and he stated that after a period of decline , a time of growth would naturally follow . Yes . It is possible for everything to grow strong . And there is plenty of room for new trees and new flowers of all kinds . So , you 're saying this is just another season in the garden , so to speak . Yes . A garden needs a lot of care and a lot of love . And if you give your garden a lot of love , things grow . But first , some things must wither . Some trees die ... - It 's that gardener . - Yeah . Chauncey Gardiner . No , he 's a real gardener . He does talk like one . But I
zone1	, but what about the bad seasons ? Does n't a country need to have someone in charge who can see it through these periods of crisis ? A leader , capable of guiding us through the bad seasons , as well as the good ? - Yes . - That bastard means it . Oh , yes . We need a very good gardener . And I do agree with the President that the garden needs a lot of care . It is a good garden . Its trees are healthy ... I realize this might be a difficult question for you to answer , but do you feel that we have in your words , a very good gardener in office at this time ? Jesus ! Yes , some plants do well in the sun and others grow better in the shade . Sounds as if we need a lot of gardening here . We certainly do . It 's for sure a white man 's world in America . I raised that boy since he was the size of a piss ant and I 'll say
zone1	No , sir . He had no brains at all . Stuffed with rice pudding between the ears . Short-changed by the Lord and dumb as a jackass . Look at him now . Yes , sir , all you got to be is white in America to get whatever you want . Gobbledygook ! What sort of gardener would you be , Mr . Gardiner ? - I am a very serious gardener . - I 'm sure you are , Mr . Gardiner . Remarkable . You 're fond of him , too , are n't you ? That 's good . That 's good . May I take your coat , Mr . Gardiner ? Bravo , sir . Outstanding ! Okay , Sally , I 'll see you in 20 minutes . Okay . I wo n't be long . I 've just got to talk to her about this gardener . Goodnight . - Look , Johanna ... - I said , goodnight . Tomorrow night Senator Rowley 's widow is holding a reception for the Soviet ambassador . It 's pretty obvious that Robert
zone1	So , you 'd be doing me a great favor if you would attend in my place , and escort Eve . Yes , Ben . I would love to escort Eve . You and Eve should create quite a stir . I can already hear the gossip . You have the gift of being natural . That 's a great talent , my boy . I hope the entire country was listening . The entire country . Darling , what 's wrong ? I ca n't . I just ca n't , right now . I 'm sorry , dearest . I just ... I just ca n't . We 'll fix up one of Ben 's for you . Sophie insists on black tie . I see . - Chauncey ? - Yes ? I do n't have very many friends . And Ben 's friends are quite a bit older than I am . Quite a bit . Goodnight . Goodnight . He was very clever , keeping it at a third grade level , that 's what they understand . Yeah ? I do n't understand
zone1	up his sleeve when he pulled that stunt with us ? What was he doing ? And why ? Who knows ? Maybe the government had something to do with it . You know he made a fool out of me . - And you know what that means ? - No . Any political future I had is right down the toilet . Jesus , the thought of spending the rest of my life as an attorney ... Well that is really a downer . And , Christ I almost forgot . Johanna is starting to think something 's going on . Sid , be reasonable . I have been everywhere . - There is no place left to look . - Try again . Sure , try again . Where ? There 's nothing . It 's like Gardiner never existed . Try again . Sid , it 's useless . I said , try again . Up yours . You try again . I quit . - ' Morning , gentlemen . - Good morning , Mr . President . - We found no information ... -
zone1	. Gardiner appeared at the Rands ' . This information goes back a day and a half . - I want the standard file , you know that . - Right , chief . Well , where is it ? Right , chief . Kaufman , what the hell are you talking about ? The Bureau has some data , sir , but it 's not pertinent . - I 'd like to hear that data . - Yes , sir . His suits were made by a New York tailor , handmade in 1928 . The tailor went out of business in 1933 and later took his own life . His underwear , all of the finest cloth . The factory was destroyed by fire in 1948 . This man carries no identification . No driver 's license , no wallet , no credit cards . Computers have analyzed his ... - Miss Davies . ... vocal characteristics . I 'd like my eggs poached this morning , please . But they can not determine his ethnic background . Come in . Have you read the newspapers ? I
zone1	of the architects of the President 's speech last night . And your comments on the television show are quoted alongside the President 's . I like the President very much . He 's a nice man . You 're very nice , too . Hi , neighbor . There 's somebody at the door . Let 's see who that special person is . It 's Mr . McFeeland . You do n't mind my being here like this ? No . I like you to be here . You do ? I 'd like to sing about something even more special . And that something is you . Thank you . I 'm so grateful . I would 've just opened up at the slightest touch . I would 've just opened up . You know ? You know that . But you 're so strong that I can trust myself with you . I 'm glad you did n't open . A long time ago , people did n't have television but they still liked to look at interesting pictures . And they would put pictures like
zone1	viewer . They would look at them very carefully . I 'll show you another one . They looked like cards . Flash cards for schools or something . But they 're really photographs . Take a careful look at them . The interesting thing about them , is that they 're two . One . Two . And they look very much alike . Here , I 'll show you another one . Mr . Thomas Franklin , please . Is Mr . Franklin in ? Certainly . This is Dr . Robert Allenby . Would you tell Mr . Franklin that I 'd like to speak to him ? It concerns Chauncey Gardiner . What was your reaction to the Post 's editorial on the President 's speech ? I did not read that . - But , sir , you must 've at least glanced at it . - I did not glance at it . The New York Times spoke of your " peculiar brand of optimism . " - What was your reaction to that ? - I do not know what it means .
zone1	of great interest to me to know just what newspapers you do read . I do not read papers . I watch TV . Do you mean that you find television 's coverage of the news better than that of the newspapers ? I like to watch TV . Thank you . You 're welcome . Few men in public life have the courage not to read the newspapers . None , that this reporter has met , had the guts to admit it . I 've never seen anyone handle the press the way you do . You 're so cool and detached . Thank you . - How are you ? - I 'm fine . How are you ? I 'm very well . I 'd like you to meet Chauncey Gardiner . Hello , Vladimir . And this is Mrs . Skrapinov . - Natasha . - Hello , Natasha . - Very nice meeting you . - And you . You must sit with us , my friends . We have much to discuss . I agree . Let 's let the men talk .
zone1	, we shall yield the pleasure of your company to others . I shall yield , too . Yes . Well , you have a nice chat . Should n't we get together more often to exchange our thoughts ? It 's strictly at the rumor stage now , Lyman . - But there 's something in the wind . - Something rather big in the wind , I 'd say . So whose files were destroyed ? The CIA 's or the FBI 's ? I do n't know . You may find , my friend , that we are not so far from each other . Not so far . We are not so far from each other . Our chairs are almost touching . Bravo . Our chairs are indeed almost touching . And we want to remain seated on them , correct ? We do n't want them snatched out from under us , am I right ? Because , if one goes , the other goes . And then boom-boom and boom-boom . What is it about his background that they 're trying to cover
zone1	subversive organization ? Homosexual , perhaps . He told me that he had been living there since he was a child working as a gardener . He showed us a room in the garage where he said he stayed , and I did n't really believe him , of course , but why the act ? Tell me do you , by any chance , enjoy Krylov 's fables ? Now , I ask you that because there is something Krylovian about you . Do you think so ? I believe that you know Krylov . So , you know your Krylov in Russian , do you ? I must confess , I had suspected as much all along . Excuse me , but would you tell me your name again ? A dash of American humor . Vladimir Skrapinov . That 's a very nice name . And yours , Chauncey Gardiner . He must have been involved on some major financial level with the deceased . - With who ? - Mr . Jennings . But our firm has no record of any such transactions . You had
zone1	You know that ? I did n't know you spoke Russian . It 's incredible . It is extremely useful to speak Russian today . - Are you proficient in other languages ? - He 's so modest , Ambassador Gaufridi . He just never advertises his accomplishments . Maybe you should talk to somebody , darling . No . No , that would n't do any good . Hello , Ronald . How are you ? - Just fine . - Good . I am fine , too . - Good . - Yes . We 're fine . Yeah , fine . My editors and I have been wondering if you 'd consider writing a book for us . Something about your political philosophy . What do you say ? - I ca n't write . - Of course not . Who can , nowadays ? I have trouble writing a postcard to my children . Look , we can give you a six-figure advance . I 'll provide you with the very best ghost writer , proofreaders ... - I ca n't read . - Of course
zone1	. We glance at things , we watch television . I like to watch TV . I 'm sure you do . No one reads . He 's very , very sexy . Do n't leave me alone with him for too long . You say he showed you his garden . He said it was his . He walked us through it . I see . Mr . Franklin , I must ask you and Ms . Hayes to keep this incident with Mr . Gardiner strictly to yourselves . There 's no telling what he could have been involved in . It could be an extremely confidential matter . - Please , not a word . - Of course , Doctor . I understand . Fine . - Thank you very much . - Certainly . Glad to be of help . I heard he speaks eight languages . And on top of everything else , holds a degree in medicine as well as law . Is n't that true , Eve ? I do n't know , Senator , but it would n't surprise me . He
zone1	, I 've never met anyone like you in Washington before . Yes , I 've been here all my life . Really ? And where have you been all my life ? Tell me , Mr . Gardiner have you ever had sex with a man ? No . I do n't think so . We could go upstairs right now . Is there a TV upstairs ? I like to watch . You like to watch ? Yes . You wait right here . I 'll go get Warren . Is it me ? - Is it something I 've done ? - No , sweetheart , it 's not ... No , it 's ... It 's not you . This never happened when you were a senator . It 's not that , it 's just that I ... - Yeah , Kaufman , what is it ? - The CIA or the FBI destroyed Gardiner 's files . - What ? Why ? - Neither agency will admit to a thing . - All right . Get Baldwin and Honeycutt over here . I 'll
zone1	. I feel safe . Ben understands my feelings for you , by the way , and he accepts them . Ben is very wise . Or thirdly , the man 's files have been destroyed . - Now , I 'd like some answers . - Gardiner 's not a foreign agent . There are now 16 countries investigating the man . I see . What about the third question ? Is it possible to erase all traces of a man ? Highly unlikely , sir . In fact , the boys around the Bureau feel that the only one capable of pulling this off would be an ex-FBI man . I do n't think that 's entirely true , Grover . What do the boys around Intelligence feel ? Well , Mr . President , they do n't quite know ... It 's very difficult for me to say goodnight to you . It 's very hard for me to leave you . It 's very hard for me , too . No . Sell all 750,000 shares of CCT . Let 's see . Sell a million
zone1	shares of Standard transferred into your account . That 's for you . I was just cleaning up some loose ends . Getting rid of the dead wood so Eve would n't have to cope with it . I 'd like to talk to you about Chauncey . You know there 's something about him that I trust . He makes me feel good . Since he 's been around the thought of dying has been much easier for me . I could n't stand it . What is it ? What 's wrong ? What 's the matter ? I do n't know what you like . I 'm sorry . I like to watch . What do you mean , you like to watch ? I like to watch . You mean me , you like to watch me do it . It 's very good . No , thanks . I never touch the stuff , never . A cigar , then ? I 'll have one of those . Thanks . Thanks very much . - Sit down , Rico . - Yeah , thanks .

Pete Montana ' s through . - And I thought he was such a big guy . - He 's through . Suppose I were to tell you that , from now on , you were Pete Montana . That you were to take over his territory in addition to your own . Will you shake on it ? One of the first things you should know about me , my darling is that I 'm a little shy . All right , it 's set . I 'm doing a lot for you , Rico . When I get you planted I 'll expect plenty of service . - You 'll sure get it . Permit me , then , to drink to the new boss of the North Side . Thank you . You look great , boss . Feels terrible . There

Knee to the chest and experimenting with the weight and going at this slowly . Please , nobody leaping up . Where did you go ? Do n't be frightened of it . It 's important to know that , yes , you could roll over . Tell her to come down . I 'm gon na put in a CVP line . No . No more shots . No more . It 's not good . I know . You uncoil my wants desire flows within me . And when you watch me , my passion it dissolves the desire . You set me free . And I reveal
zone1	Mr . Rand would like to see you . I would like to see Ben . Yes , Ben ? Are you going to die now ? I think I 'm going to surrender the horn of plenty for the horn of Gabriel . Give me your hand . Let me feel your strength . I hope that you 'll stay here with Eve . Take care of her . She cares for you . Watch over her . She 's a delicate flower . A flower . Yes . There 's so much left to do . I 've spoken to them , my associates . They 're eager very eager , to meet you . Tell Eve ... He 's gone . Yes , I know . I 've seen this before . It happens to old people . Will you be leaving now ? Yes , in a day or two . Yes . Eve is staying . She said she will not close up the house . You 've become quite a close friend of Eve 's , have n't you Chance ? Yes . I
zone1	gardener , are n't you ? I am a gardener . I 'll go and tell Eve about Ben . I understand . I understand . I know that Ben said , " Keep it small and quiet . " And I do n't want to go against his wishes but I thought it would be good , while our friends are carrying Ben to his last resting place to read from his quotes . " I have no use for those on welfare ... " ... no patience whatsoever . " But if I am to be honest with myself ... " ... I must admit that they have no use for me , either . " I do not regret having political differences with men that I respect . " I do regret , however ... " ... that our philosophies ... " ... kept us apart . " Yes , I agree . Except he 's so boring . What about Max ? - He could never take an election . - Correct . The people of this country need to be awakened . What about Lawson
zone1	exciting , I 'm afraid . If they start bringing up ... Gentlemen , time is running out . We must come to a decision . " I have heard the word ' sir ' ... " ... more often ... " ... than I have heard the word ' friend ' . " But I suppose ... " ... there are other rewards for wealth . " I have met with kings . " During these conferences ... " ... I have suppressed bizarre thoughts : Could I beat him in a foot race ? " Could I throw a ball further than he ? " No matter what our fa ? ade , we are all children . " What about Chauncey Gardiner ? What do we know of the man ? Absolutely nothing . We do n't have an inkling of his past . Correct . That could be an asset . A man 's past cripples him . His background turns into a swamp and invites scrutiny . Until this time , he has n't said anything that could be held against him . And the
zone1	Show was the highest they 've ever had . And ? And it was 95 percent pro . I 'm certainly open to the idea . It would be absolute lunacy to support the President for another term . That is exactly why I agree with Ben 's final wishes . " I was born into a position of extreme wealth . " I have spent many sleepless nights ... " ... thinking about extreme poverty . " I 've lived a lot ... " ... trembled a lot ... " ... was surrounded by little men who forgot that we enter naked ... " ... and exit naked ... " ... and that no accountant can audit life in our favor . " I do believe , gentlemen , if we want to hold on to the Presidency our one and only chance is Chauncey Gardiner . " When I was a boy , I was told ... " ... that the Lord fashioned us from his own image . " That 's when I decided to manufacture mirrors . " Security . " Tranquility . " A well-deserved
zone1	" ... will soon be realized . " Life ... " ... is a state of mind . " I understand . Is it all clear there , boys ? Can you read that ? What was the message , Mr . Gardiner ? " Now , get this , honky ... " Sorry , carry on . Okay . All set . What was the message , Mr . Gardiner ? " Now , get this , honky . " You go tell Raphael ... " ... that I ai n't taking no jive ... " Sorry . " That I ai n't taking no jive ... " ... from no Western Union messenger . " You tell that asshole if he ... " Did you see me going ... " Yes . You tell that asshole ... " Marker . " Ai n't taking no jive from no ... " ... Western Union manager . " Messenger . Manager . What did I say ? Sorry . " ... from no Western Union messenger . " You tell that asshole ...

" ... that I ai n't taking no jive ... " ... from no Western Union messenger . " You tell that asshole ... " ... if he got something to tell me ... " ... to get his ass down here himself .

zone1	. And all his empty promises ? - I do . - I do . Let me hear from you . I want to know how the kid 's doing . Where he goes to school . All that . When Richard deserted in Vietnam ... I wish you 'd had him arrested ... instead of bringing him back and covering for him . He was yours after that . He wanted you to be the baby 's godfather ... so you are . Do n't come around anymore , please . Come on , Jamie ! No mail . What is this , Watergate again ? Do n't give me that Watergate stuff . - Look at you . - What 's the matter with me ? I was good enough for you when you married me . I ca n't stand looking at you . No wonder I have n't got any money to ... I work 14 hours a day ... Do dogs get too fat ? Now , we also heard of a woman in Los Angeles ... who will write a song for your dog
zone1	along with a biography and $75 ... and she 'll send you a cassette ... a musical portrait of your pooch . You got any money ? What 's it to you ? You can always be a beggar when you grow up . Endean ? No , I do n't know him . How 'd you get up here ? Yes . The corporate interests I represent ... contemplate investing several hundred million dollars ... in the development of certain resources in Zangaro . - Where ? - West Africa . Do you read the papers , Mr . Shannon ? The president , Olu Kimba , is frequently on the front page . Yeah . Go on . Before money is invested in Zangaro ... we have to know a lot more ... about the stability of Kimba 's regime . Is a coup d ' ? tat imminent ... or even possible ? We have to know . You can get that information through an embassy . Who the hell do you think has diplomatic relations ... with a maniac like Kimba ? I do n't know
zone1	of commodities . One day , we 'll go to war over rice . The job pays $10,000 . Fifteen . Half tomorrow , the rest when I get back .

Seemed like a damn messy way to be killed to me . - He go ? - I do n't know . He told me about the baptism . That 's damn
zone1	. I 'll see you . You got a godfather ? Going in with such a conspicuous cover ... is unnecessarily risky . I need a reason to be there with a camera . Go as a tourist . Do n't worry about it . What the hell is a tourist doing in Zangaro ? - I 've no idea . - Right . A reconnaissance is no good if you do n't come back . I al ways come back . Please sit up and fasten your seat belt . Thank you . Brown ? Keith Brown , yes . What business do you have in Zangaro ? I work for a nature magazine . I take pictures of birds . Pictures of birds . Yes . In there . Attention , please . Here is an important announcement . Visitors to Zangaro are warned ... that there is a curfew in the city of Clarence ... between 6 p . m . and 6 a . m . Do you have a drinking problem , Mr . Brown ?

Can I give you a lift into town , my son ? Yes . Thank you . Is this your first trip to Zangaro ? Yes . Wel come to Clarence . Thanks again . Good-bye . God bless . Hello . My name is Keith Brown . I cabled you about a room . Brown . We 've received no cable , Mr . Brown . I sent it last week . The telegraph system is somewhat irregular . How long do you wish to stay with us ? Four or five days . You got something quiet , maybe in the back ? Foreigners are restricted to the second floor . Whatever you got with its own shower . Your passport , please . Do you need that ? It will be returned to you when you leave . You will have ... room 12 . Mr . Brown , your jeep is outside
zone1	just another asshole . Keep turning on the boy . Keep shooting . Listen , we 've got permission ... Watch the jeep ! Take it easy . Everything 's all right . This way . Ken , keep it on the boy . Good evening , Mr . Brown . Did you get many pictures ? That guy you sent me this morning is n't working out . I did n't send him . We ca n't make a film about your bloody country ... from the hotel lobby , for Christ 's sake ! Thank you very kindly . Lousy bastards . Jeez . That kid , eh ? Aw , bastards . Bastards ! Leave it , for Christ 's sake . We 'll be out of here by the end of the week . How about a beer ? Beer , Alan ? Bollocks ! Having some trouble , Mr . North ? Just a fundamental difference ... about the value of human life , Mr . Dexter . Nothing that need concern you . Stupid question , but any messages for me ? The wireless
zone1	Mr . North , this is Mr . Keith Brown , an American . That should n't be too much of a language barrier . Shall we give it a try ? Beer ? Sure . What about the Russians ? There were a couple of mining engineers ... in here a few months ago , doing some kind of survey . The Russians must have got onto it ... and sent these two down . They have n't been able to get a government permit . Poor bastards are losing their minds . Put on your party smile . Good evening . President Kimba . President . Mr . Keith Brown . American naturalist . How you doing ? President Kimba shares your interest in our wildlife ... especially our native birds . Drink . Sure . Very kind . Here 's to you . Due to his many responsibilities ... President Kimba does n't have the time ... to research the scientific names ... of some of our rare species . Busy , busy , busy . Drink . No . One for my father . So kind
zone1	could give him a scientific name ... for the great crested grebe . Yeah ? Maybe some other time . Just for you . Podiceps cristatus . Right ? And the storm petrel ? Hydrobates ... there 's more ... Pelagius . Right ? And what about the bubbling cisticola ? The esmaralda troglodytes . And there 's my absolute favorite ... and yours ... Nectarina famosa . Here 's to them , God bless them . Drink . Public drunkenness is a crime in Zangaro . Who 's that guy ? Woody Woodpecker ? Good evening , Miss Dexter . Mr . Brown ... I 'm Gabrielle Dexter . My father suggested I show you around Clarence tomorrow . Sounds good . Meet me in the lobby at 8:00 . That 's the only sight worth seeing in this bloody town . It 's friendly , too . I would n't know . It does n't talk to me . One for the road ? No , thanks . I 'll see you tomorrow . Around here ... even the birds know better than to be out at night
zone1	I 'm no expert ... either . What did you guys do to get in trouble today ? A bunch of soldiers were hauling off a young kid . He was scared out of his wits . Finally , he managed to pull himself free . One of the bastards drove a bayonet through his throat . We were right there with the camera . We got it . Then they ripped the film out of the camera ... and herded us back here . I 'm surprised Kimba I ets you people in here . I 'll be more surprised if he lets us out . How 'd he get the job ? Well , after they won independence ... there were three candidates for the presidency ... General Kimba ... a Colonel Bobi ... and a physician , a moderate called Dr . Okoye . Okoye wanted to maintain links with the mother country ... while our two gallant freedom fighters ... ranted about neocolonialism , et cetera . Kimba got elected . Do n't ask me why he won over Bobi . From what I 've heard
zone1	Kimba took office ... he forced Bobi into exile and threw Dr . Okoye in prison . Any opposition left ? You do n't oppose Kimba . That 's treason . For that , he has your entire family murdered . Nobody really knows what 's going on here . You 'd think whatever his name is ... would come in here and kick him out . He 's no threat to any other country . He 's content to stay within his borders ... and slaughter his own . I mean slaughter . Ca n't you smell it ? Trouble is ... there 's so much of it everywhere else in the world ... nobody wants to know . Right . You 're a quiet one . Bird-watching 's a quiet business . How would you know ? You 're not CIA , are you ? You 're hardly KGB . Thanks for the drink . You are , are n't you ? You 're fucking CIA . This is President Kimba 's official residence . It belonged to the British governor in colonial times . You live in
zone1	home a lot . The president no longer lives here . God spoke to him in a dream . He told him he should live among his warriors . Where is that , the jungle ? He lives at the garrison . In 1937 , the colonial government ... erected new ministerial offices . It was the first electricity in Zangaro . A year later , the Grand Pavilion was built . At the spring assemblies ... as many as a thousand people would dance inside . The chandeliers were shipped from Europe . You got a passport ? Why do you ask ? I ca n't believe you stay here . This is not America , Mr . Brown . What I do is never governed by choice ... only by circumstance . That 's not true . Is Kimba Christian ? He 's head of our church . I saw a couple of nuns and a priest when I got here . How do they feel about that ? They went away , but they 're coming back now . There were some difficulties . I 'll bet
zone1	included in the Lord 's Prayer ... there are no more problems . Is that where he lives ? Details regarding the garrison are not available to anyone . Stand there . Say " Cheese " for the scrapbook . The scrapbook ? It 's where you keep your memories . And what 's in yours ? Not too much . Mr . Brown , what are you really doing here ? I told you . I 'm studying birds . Birds are smart . They migrate . They know when things are gon na change ... and they fly away . Why do n't we have dinner ? I 'm late . Excuse me . Whoa ! Wait a minute ! Wait ... Mr . Brown . Mr . Brown , can you hear me ? OK . Mr . Brown , what are you doing in Clarence ? Water . Just tell me , what are you doing in Clarence ? Water . You are a naturalist , are you not ? Right . Why did you take this picture of the garrison ? She 's pretty ...
zone1	a doctor . I was told to clean your wounds . You are being deported . Released . Why ? One of the guards said ... an Englishman has been here all day ... trying to talk with you , interview you . He also filed a formal protest with the Swiss consul . You have a friend , Mr . Brown . You a prisoner ? Over four years . What 'd you do ? Bad judgment . I was a candidate for president . Dr . Okoye . How would you know that ? The English ... man ... my friend . How long have I been here ? Since yesterday . Why did they do this ? Possibly for being in the wrong company . The guard said you were with Gabrielle Dexter . She 's one of Kimba 's mistresses . She ... It was her ? No . She 's beautiful ... not treacherous . Beauty is a currency . Unfortunately , here in Zangaro ... it only has value in the presidential palace . Have some of these . Painkillers . They 'll help
zone1	tell us why you were arrested ? What were conditions like inside the prison ? Were you able to see any other prisoners ? Mr . Brown ... they say Dr . Okoye is , in fact , dead . Can you confirm that ? Mr . Brown ... you ca n't leave Zangaro without your passport , asshole . No fractures , but I do n't understand ... why the hell you did n't see the doctor in Paris . Still got blood in the urine ? Yeah . Four , five , six . Six healthy concussions in the last three years . Two crushed disks , two temporal fractures ... one major pneumothorax , perforated stomach ... a hundred bouts with unheard-of tropical diseases ... a shitload of arm and leg fractures ... dyscrasia , dysentery , dyspepsia , dysuria ... dysphoria ! Anything starting with " D " I did n't get ? Yeah ... dead . Henry , you 've got to get some new jokes . I do n't know what you got planned for your old age ... or who you figure on
zone1	it . You 've taken a lot of years off the back end of your life . Thanks . Why did n't you call me as soon as you got back ? I was busy . You got the money ? No , no . Do n't take your coat off ! There , that 's for you . What does it mean ? Can Kimba be replaced ? Just read the report . Is there any chance of a coup ? No , not now . He do n't trust his own army . Rations the bullets . He 's crazy , see ? So , unless there 's some guerrilla army building up ... outside Zangaro I do n't know about , forget it . The people I represent wo n't do business with a madman . He 's obviously got to go . What 'd you say ? Could a well-trained ... well-equipped mercenary force succeed ? - Succeed ? At what ? - Replacing Kimba . What 'd you find over there ? Oil ? Diamonds ? Could it succeed ? Sure . Why not ?
zone1	operation like that off the ground ? Not me . You bought a recon . You got it . I 'm paid . I 'm done . Let 's go ! You 're paid , Shannon , but you 're not finished . What would you want to get back what they took from you ? Would $100,000 cure cold feet ? You got me mixed up with somebody else . Hello . Operator . I 'd like to make a person-to-person . Name , please . Jessie Shannon . Jessie Shannon . Area code , please . Area code 3-0-1 . 4-4-6-1-8-0-8 . Who shall I say is calling ? Just say Jessie . Will you hold on , please ? Wait a minute . Do n't tell me to hold on . You hold on . Hello ? Hello ? Your move . God damn it ! I 'll get it , Dad . Sit down . Hard to keep my bluffer 's composure ... with the damn phone ringing . Saved by the bell ? It 's up to you . Jessie , it 's me .
zone1	Hotel . It 's a couple of blocks from where the Starlight was . The Starlight burned down . Yeah , I know . That was two years ago . Jamie ? You OK ? Sure . What are you doing here ? I want to see you ... but ... could you come down here ? I do n't want to run into your father . Give me half an hour . Pair of jacks . Three jacks , pair of 9s . Jessie ? Everything OK ? Yeah , sure . Daddy , I 'm going out for a while . Could you get us some more ice first ? Yeah , sure . I 'm out . I 'll stop playing poker when Carlos is off . You should n't be doing this . Do n't be silly . Go on and play your hand . Who called ? Jamie . What did he want ? - He wants to see me . - You think that 's wise ? We were married , for Christ 's sake . If he wants to see me , I
zone1	Jessie . I know it . He has n't changed . He 's the same irresponsible bastard you divorced ! I did n't divorce him . You did ! - Did I scare you ? - Yes . It 's cold . - Is that you ? - Yeah . You got skinny . You got on dark glasses . How come ? I did n't want you to see that ... You were crying ? Yeah . They do a great job . What do you want to do ? You got time ? Yeah . Some . - Let 's eat . - OK . I love you , Jessie . That 's what I 'm here about . I want to move . West . Colorado , maybe Montana . I never been there , but it 's clean , it 's open . I want to get a regular job . Buy a house . What do you say ? It 's all the stuff we used to talk about . I got the money to get us started . When were you thinking about going
zone1	I want to go yesterday . - You have n't changed . - No . Still the considerate planner . What do you say ? Why do n't we keep it simple tonight ? The way the tax situation is out there ... the land costs you practically nothing . You put a house on it and stay there . This guy tells me you can put a trailer on the land . The government does n't know the difference . They do n't care . You mad or what ? You have n't asked about my father . Yes , I did . I asked you to go away with me . If you 'd said yes , I 'd know he was dead . It was n't his fault . - Was it mine ? - As much as anybody 's . Oh , please . I did n't move out . You did n't try very hard to stop me . Do n't tell me that . I did n't move out ! You did . It 's what you do , Jamie . You fight wars
zone1	's wars . You get paid to kill people , get your ass blown off . You would be great in Colorado , out west . You could be a hired gun , play cowboy . We 're talking about your father . He did n't want you married to anybody , did he ? He needs somebody he can depend on . Most drunks do . It 's so easy for you . You come back after two and a half years . You do n't know what 's going on in my life . You just expect me to drop everything and follow you ! Wait a minute . Come with me , Jessie . By the time he gets around to dying ... there wo n't be a dance left in you . Good-bye , Jamie . Endean . It 's a bad time for me , Jamie . My sister 's marriage busted up ... so she and the kids move in with me . You know she do n't work . Leave her some money . It 's not the point . She do n't

What do you care ? It 's his story . That candy ass is scared of getting greased . I got a better story with Miranda being pregnant . You want to stay home , too ? No . Watching her get fat is gon na be nauseating . I would n't waste any time getting our money in the bank . Putting it all together in 40 days ... will be tough enough . Right .

Express leaving Platform 13 ... will stop at Rugby , Leicester , Loughborough ... Nottingham , and Sheffield . Jamie , Michel 's here . Do n't go by this . Takes longer to go from here . That 'll give you a better idea of what I 'm talking about . These are good . You did n't take them . No . They were a gift . Michel , you want a beer ? Derek ? What is this , coffee or tea ? It 's terrible . He al ways home ? He will be . Zangaro has an independence day coming up . How long do we hold it ? As long as it takes to fly ... the new president in from the border . Who is it going to be ? - Nixon . - That 's not funny , Drew . Come on , Jamie . Punch up your brief and

Do it that way , but I have to be sure ... the money will be in his account tomorrow . I assure you it will be
zone1	over the next couple of weeks . Be our pleasure . Thank you , Nigel . Good afternoon , sir . Hey , Keith ! Keith Brown ! Message for Mr . Brown from General Kimba . I 'll be damned . How are you ? I 'm fair to lousy . You seem to have improved considerably . - I 'm OK . - Good . Was the film any use to you ? - Yeah . - Good . Good . Glad to be of help . I do n't suppose you 'd have ... Can I buy you a drink ? What a good idea . I thought you 'd never ask . So ... what 's your name , Mr . Brown ? Shannon ... James . That 's an improvement on the other one . What are you doing in London ? I 've got to see some people . What 's the message ? - Message ? - Kimba . " Come back , all is forgiven . " Did you get to see him ? After your ruckus with the soldiers ... one
zone1	broken neck . You would n't know anything about that ? No . Kimba 's paranoia took a jump after that . He would n't see anyone , including me . There were nine executions the next day . Four of them were women . I did n't get that piece , either . I was being escorted to the airport at the time . I got thrown out of the country , thank you very much . Dexter 's daughter OK ? Funny you should mention her . The day I was leaving , she actually talked to me . She asked me what I knew about you . Pathetically little , I had to confess . Did you get your film on the air ? Last week . How 'd you make out ? " Behind these very walls , just a few feet from me ... " resides Africa 's most brutal dictator . " It is rumored ... " There are conflicting reports ... " High-ranking sources who have asked not to be named ... " say , ' Who knows ' ... " Five million
zone1	's too bad . Yeah . When are you going back ? You gon na ask a lot of questions I ca n't answer ? I stuck out my neck for you , for Christ 's sake . You owe me a little more than a drink . You ought to watch your step . What I do is none of your business . That 's a matter of opinion . Is there a number I can reach you ? You 'll get in trouble . I 'm not in town long . Fancy that . - It was good to see you . - Likewise . - Can I suggest something ? - Fire away . Which shells do you use ? That 's very good . You put the right mix in this thing ... and its killing potential is fantastic . Your operation is an assault , I suspect . The XM 18 is effective up to 400 meters . If you load it in a well-thought-out sequence ... it 's devastating . For instance , first you use two rounds flares ... then a couple gas
zone1	tactical , antitank , antipersonnel ... It 's what we in the business call a mixed-fruit pudding . What would you say is the rate of fire ? Eighteen rounds in five seconds . It 's the ultimate in killing technology . It 's light , accurate , and mobile . Ever been in combat yourself ? I 'm a Canadian . 12 , 18 , 26 for the Uzis and the XM 18s . You got a ship ? Not yet . I 'll get the name to you when I do . Fine . Total , including my percentage ... 31,5 . Let 's make it 32 . 31,5 . Here 's 15 . You get another 10 ... when I see the stuff crated and ready to go . The balance ... when the ship sails . It 's not a question of where she 's been , mister . She 's a great ship . Haifa , Gibraltar ... Tangiers , Dakar , Monrovia , you name it . - Single hold ? - Aye , twin hatches . We need you and your crew .
zone1	crew and 10,000 for yourself . I 'll need to talk to them . We have n't got time for a ballot . I count the votes , mister . What is your cargo ? It 's not peanuts for Monrovia . Peanuts is rats , mister . Every kind of cargo 's got its own kind of trouble . What is your cargo ? Just trouble . The ship heads for Toulon tonight . I 'll call Michel , tell him to get on the road . Hackett 's hardware 's in Valencia . Good . I got ta get something to eat . I got a meeting . Endean 's introducing me to Zangaro 's next president . Whoop-de-doo . Pack your White House manners . Do me a favor . There 's a guy named North following me . He 's OK , but he 's a reporter . - Oh , Jesus . - Do n't hurt him . Do n't kill him , but discourage him . If he finds out what we 're up to ... he 'll have it on the 6:00 news
zone1	Scouts of America . I 'm sorry , I do n't ... Right . Look out ! Go on ! Jump the wall ! Jump ! You idiot ! Come on , move it ! You 're going with me . Move it ! Taxi ! Come on ! This man needs a doctor ! When Zangaro was fighting for independence ... he was as much a national hero as Kimba . We fought in the bush together . Brothers . Then when he makes himself president ... his first official business was to put a price on my head . When he left the country , some soldiers went with him . We 've been together a long time now . Excellent fighters . Very loyal . I have selected the best of them for you . There 'll be twenty-four waiting in Freetown . They 're very good . They 'll die for Zangaro . Be more help to me if they fight . If there is one who does n't , I 'll take his head ... and mount it on the palace gates . You and
zone1	business . Olu Kimba did not do business . So now , Sekou Bobi will be president . He wants to be God ... I want to be rich . Shannon , why do n't you brief us on your strike plan ? You coming along ? There 's nothing you need to know about . The colonel 's due at the garrison ... at 0500 hours on the 25th . That 's 5 a . m . You 're a minute late ... I give the whole thing back to Kimba . You 're working for me , Shannon . You could fire me . If anything comes up , I 'll be in touch . Mr . Shannon , when I am president ... it would be to your advantage to be my friend . Mr . Endean could tell you what a generous friend I am . I got all the friends I can handle right now . Forget about your soldiers . I got my own . Just do n't be late . Do n't worry . He 's expendable . To the hotel . I
zone1	had to talk to him . Just so we understand each other , you 're dead . Give me straight answers , and I 'll keep it painless . Go fuck yourself . Oh , no ! No . No ! Who 's paying you ? Who 's paying you ? Same as pays you . What 'd he have you doing ? Keeping track of your whole operation . He tell you to kill North ? He was a journalist . He 'd have blown it for you . Did Endean tell you to kill him ? I make my own decisions . So the bloody fool said , " Do n't bother to wrap it . " I 'll eat it on the way home . " The measure of a man is in his appetites . The more you consume , the more you are . Do you measure ladies in the same way ? No . Ladies are not measured . They are judged . Oh , very good . Maybe one of you ladies would like ... to come to my palace in Zangaro ,
zone1	and I had thought we 'd like to visit your country . I 'll get it downstairs . Maybe you both can come ? With your appetites , you 'd need us both . Hello . Yes , good evening , sir . It 's a very bad connection . He 's already signed all the agreements . All the papers will be dated once he 's in power . Hello ? Can you hear me ? What ? Manson Industries ... will have the exclusive mineral and mining rights ... for all Zangaro . No . No , he 's no idea what 's at stake . I promise . I do n't believe he can even spell " Platinum . " Things are going very well , sir . Valencia . On the 18th . Subject to technical difficulties . It can happen . But you got to be there . Want a drink ? No . You do n't need to worry about me , mister . But I do . Look , Shannon , if something goes wrong ... I lose my license . I do
zone1	stuff on board tomorrow . What is it ? It has n't left Madrid yet . We made a deal . It 's too risky now . If they check your end user certificate ... you 're finished . Cancel the order . Want to give me my money back ? Make the call . Brown . Sir , that 's one of my seamen . Want to see your papers . Why do you need eight men in such a small ship ? Seamen 's card ? I left it with my buddy 's gear aboard ship . He 's an employee of the company . Missed his ship in Brindisi . He 's coming with us to Malta and going on to Telakia . Right . That last port . Last place anybody will check the hold . You did good back there . Whose war are you gon na fight ? Out ! Squad , attention ! Do you think these geezers can fight ? Strictly bush league . Never seen anything newer than bolt-action Enfields . I hope they do n't blow the bottom out of
zone1	Reporting , Captain . Let 's go . All right . Pay attention ! We 'll fire a few rounds , show you how they pull . Now , they tend to pull up and to the right . I 'll give you an example . Squad ! Ready ! Fire ! Squad , attention ! Stand easy . Cuban . We 'll be on the beach at 0400 . Sentries are spotted for you , so be quick . Once the firefight starts , we got only 15 minutes . If it goes over that ... I do n't want to even think about it . - How long to the bridge ? - About 10 minutes . If none of you have worked with hired soldiers before ... we handle tactics .

zone1	3141659 Suicide cases in the mysterious forest have increased recently . Actually , there are four more similar forests in the world . They are in Thailand , Japan , North America and Australia . Governments of various countries have had concerns on it . This mysterious forest is named the hot spot for suicides , in there , it is just like a labyrinth . Even the compass ca n't tell the direction . Ordinary people sure would get lost inside , even the professional search party may possibly get lost , too . The forest seems to have life . It does n't welcome people visit as they like . In last week , when a detective worked in the forest , he suddenly died of heart attack . Was his death really caused by heart attack ... Or , is there another reason ? And , for those who committed suicide in the forest ... most of them lived far away . Why did they come a long way to commit suicide ? For the above questions , we still have n't got any answer yet . But we try to find them out by other means
zone1	who got special experience to share with us . From what they say , you can judge it yourself ... and to explain the mysterious power behind the forest . During that period , I 've just broken up with my girlfriend . Of course I was depressed , I wanted to die . So I came to that forest to plan for committing suicide . On that day , I came alone in the afternoon . I wanted to cut my wrist . When I just wanted to take out the cutter , I felt it a kinda weird chilliness , I got gooseflesh . Suddenly , a white girl appeared . She flew to me . I saw her eyes red . It 's really scary . I was so afraid , so I ran for my life . She tailed after me , she never stopped . It seemed that she did n't want to let me go . I was so afraid that I just knew to run ! I did n't know anything else but to run ! I bumped against a tree , and
zone1	Ah Long ! Have n't you heard me ? Nope . Did n't you hear me , or you did n't want to answer me ? I did n't hear you ! Boss , May 's programme is showing . It shows the footages about people who met ghosts . What did I tell you ? At 1 2 o'clock sharp , You must turn on the sprinkler . But what have you done here ? Yes , boss . I told you many times , we must keep our promises . Did you hear me ? Boss ... I heard that ... the forest is really haunted . You must go no matter it is haunted or not . But the reporter said , ordinary people ca n't leave after entry . In May 's programme , there shows the footages of people who met ghosts . So it tells the truth that the forest is haunted , does n't it ? This is so called TV idiots syndrome . They make money through TV commercials . If they say there is n't haunted , who would tune in
zone1	white face and red eyes . A detective died of heart attack ! Do n't worry kid , you wo n't be that lucky . You will have a long life . And , stirk wo n't be afraid of tiger , you know ? Yes , stirk wo n't be afraid of tiger , but you know ? It will possibly be afraid of ghost , my dear boss ! ( **38;144;TOOLONG ... ) I am detective C.C . Ha , I have just taken over your case . I am Cheng Sing-bong , lawyer representing Patrick Wong . Hi , Detective Ha . Hi . Detective , what do you want us to help ... so that you wo n't be in trouble before the expiry of charging ? And , we 'd like to help so you can achieve in front of your boss . Just tell us your request , we can discuss . My job is to ... Charge Patrick Wong with murder and rape against the victim Chan Fong . I told the last detective who died of heart attack . The only way
zone1	evidence . Not only that . If there is evidence , you 'd automatically admit guilty . When all detectives start to take over any cases , They 're always confident , I really like that . I believe that you 'd try your own best . Do n't worry ! The producer told me today that , after the late news after 1 1 , he would like me to host a new programme for 5 minutes . Contents like today 's forest , something haunted , you know ? It 's great ! My show time would be increased ! Wait ... I gave you some information about trees last week . You told me that they were for an academic programme . Now , they served for the haunted forest ... And , five more minutes ? Have you ever considered ? Is n't it righteous to spread superstition ? I just ca n't help ! This is the producer 's decision . I ca n't say no . What position do I have ? I ca n't talk to him with science . He said he
zone1	can ask people out there . Almost 90% of people believe that the forest is haunted ... than the supernatural power you stated . People only pay trust to programmes produced by foreigners . However , more talks bring more trusts . If you get famous , the producer would urge for your host . At that time , you can say anything you like . Sure no one would doubt your words . No matter why people of this age still believe in ghosts . It is an entertaining programme . If you do n't entertain others , who would tune in ? But we must tell the truth . But not giving hypnotic education . If I get evidence to prove my words , I want you to be the first one to shut up ! Ghost , huh ? Shum Shu-hoi , is this meal for debating ... ghost against science ? Detective Ha , the boss wants me to inform you officially , close Patrick Wong 's file as soon as possible . I would like to remind you one thing . The bastard raped with
zone1	works . If we want to put him behind bars ... lt 's really tough ... I believe that the forest can tell what happened on that day . Detective Ha , I just want to be frank ... I have planned for a migration . When you close the file , when I can have my family union . Thank you for being so frank . I know what I should do . Have some tea to calm you down . The sun does n't shine in . The humidity is high in the forest . When the weather changes , it becomes foggy . Yes . Luckily I met you , or I did n't know how to get out . Luckily ... Everyday I walk back to work on the path you got lost . If not , I did n't know how to help you . I came from the district office of the 4th District . A woman detective , you must be the first one ... Why did you come alone ? Did n't your boss send anyone to come with you ? I
zone1	to know this time ? Some one reported the murder case at your office . As recorded , around this forest , there finds only this substation . Correct . So I 'd like to know one thing ... Other than Patrick Wong , is there any other suspicious ... Nope . Nope ? You mean no other suspicious person found ? I was not in the office , I was on leave . I did n't know who called the police . As I know , you are the only officer in the substation . No one takes your shift . It does n't imply that I ca n't have any day off . About that call ... Actually , I always put the phone outside for public use when I am off . Mr . Tin , I would like you to be co-operative . That girl did n't deserve it . I am old . So many things happened in the city , the city people should handle it themselves . In that forest , by the way , she was not the only one to deserve
zone1	would n't have been that aggressive , right ? I would . For anyone who does n't want to die , I would always try all means to save him . I 'd bear your words in mind . It 's getting dark now . You ca n't leave if you stay any longer . This way please . Detective , see you ! I 'd be back . I know you 'd be back . is that all right ? We 're stealing for electricity supply . If anything goes wrong , it would be on fire , and it kills ! But you can make it faster , right ? It 's going to be okay after a little twist . What 's up with you ? You bring along the amplifiers ? Well , I ca n't figure out how much the output is , so I try to make use of these amplifiers , it 's safer . And I want to try the effect of them , killing two birds with one stone . Stop playing with it , or I 'll kill you !

What 's up with you ? You 've got a registered mail . All right . Okay , thank you . All right , thank you . Stop playing with the amplifiers . Boss , there is a letter from the Graduate to you .

He is like a ghost sneaking out right there ... Then you heard dog barking . I wonder ... did you see ... The legendary Heaven 's Dog ? On that day , I planned to commit suicide . Suddenly it became foggy
zone1	I was fogbound I became senseless , I just saw everything white . Everything is white ! This is so called Near Death Experience . I interviewed many people who shared the same experience . When they were close to death , they would view something from the spiritual world . At that time , I planned to commit suicide . Suddenly , I was fogbound . It was so foggy . Then , the fog came towards me and surrounded me . Then , I was so panic . I was so afraid and I pissed . Actually I did n't want to tell this to others . Suddenly , a white figure came towards me . Not only one , but more and more . They came towards me , approaching me . May I ask one thing , when you came to the forest , What way did you plan to kill yourself ? I planned to cut my wrist . I cut my wrist with a cutter , I thought I would have died for sure . Cut ! Good shot ! Okay , this is

Sorry , professor , sorry to let you wait . Never mind , Shu-hoi . The board has approved your application . Hope your research would be a success . Then , your report will be published in the " Scientists ' World " . I can get my pay this time ! From your statement , on the day the body was found , you planned to commit suicide in the forest . You said your appearance at the scene because of suicide ? I stated it clearly in my statement . Do you want to lead me to deny my own statement ? Actually it 's me who do n't trust you ... entering the forest for committing suicide . If not the police arrested my client , he would have probably committed suicide . And we would n't

I found the victim on this tree . So I took her down . The red rope was put right here . I tried to wake her up . I found that she seemed to be still breathing . So I gave her simple first-aid and artificial respiration . Then I came this way . When I came to this position ... I saw the girl hang over there . Then I took her down . But I found that , almost right here ... Why did n't they work ? Did they sleep ? You spent all our prize money on these things ? Not prize money , but research fund . I have made good use of them , I bought some machines . At least , I got this second-handed seismograph . How about my salary of last month ? For another investment ? I

If you do n't concentrate yourself , I 'd print your obituary on it , too . What do you think ? Hello ? Hello ? Are you working ? Can we talk something ? Yes , since we are both working , let 's talk tonight , okay ? Listen first . Dead bodies were found in the forest . As told , they were people reported lost some times ago . I am now hurrying into it . But I bet you remember one thing , huh ? I booked a table at 7 o'clock tonight , remember ? Listen , I meet a traffic jam now . I must wait for the police 's announcement and the coroner 's report . I think ... I would be off real late tonight . So I just ca n't celebrate your birthday tonight

It 's not the case . It gave me a message . It told me that it was so afraid . Why does n't it react now ? Non stop release formed an ion net in the magnetic system . When the number increases , when it goes overlap , it will form cracks . Just like weaving . There are many tiny holes in between . When electricity is filled in , so the holes are filled . It can connect to the Magnetic Resonance Field and stabilize it . It then stimulates the nerve cells of plants . So it outputs weak and intermittent message in wave form . And the second stage it ... Actually , I must thank my girlfriend indirectly . Why ? The reason is , that day was my birthday . She was busy and she refused to spend
zone1	Actually , I wanted to cut the plant because of my mood swung . When I just about to cut , it used my hand-free headset ... it gave me a message through the headset . It told me that it was afraid . Actually , they can feel fear . Then I tried to pretend to cut it . But I did n't intend to cut it , I just ... lt knew it , it knew I pretended to cut it . It knows us , human beings are emotional . The plants are ... They have memory . They can think , they can ... they can react . To me , this is called Lie Detector of Plants . I absolutely believe what it says . Hi , I am Detective C.C . Ha . What is this ? This is Tillandsia , belongs to the Bromeliaceae family . Same family with pineapples . It 's funny , it absorbs water in air . No mud is needed , no basin is needed , it is so independent . Just take it out for a little
zone1	help , Mr . Shum . I hope to make use of your message exchange method with plants ... to identify a murder and rape case . We 'd try all means to co-operate with you . is it about the detective who died of heart attack in the forest ? Yes . All right . But this case should be highly confidential . Sure . May I ask one thing , for any requests from us ... I bet you 'd satisfy them , right ? Yes , any request . The detective C.C . Ha came to me today . Who is detective Cici ? The one who investigates the murder and rape case . Why did she look for you ? She needs my help . What help ? Just help ! What do you want to hide from me ? She just wants to borrow my machine to test the trees . What machine ? What for ? Why testing the trees ? There must be something behind , just tell me . I promised not to tell . You are something , huh ? You
zone1	listening , but you do n't tell me . I promised to keep my promise . And , this may be a very good chance . We just ca n't miss it . It 's not easy for me to host a new programme . Why do n't you help me ? Do you want me to report entertainment news for the rest of my life ? Tell me ! Come on ! Do you think only your business is important ? With this stuff ... You can then charge Patrick Wong with murder ? With it , I can close file before your migration . I can approve it . But I have no authority to apply for any expense on it . Mr . Shum did n't ask for any charge . Trees are there , trees are around here , too . I studied it at home . This time , we have a very imaginative space . So I decided to add tree demons in it . The closest to this tree , link them up with this line , then ... Actually it is out-fashioneddated
zone1	are here now , we try our best to ... Before entry , we must mark several places . Or , it 's really hard to find a way out . And , you just ca n't receive any call right here .

I forgot to tell you , you look pale . Why not take an early rest ? No , I just want to finish my work in office first . Well , call me if necessary . Take care . Hello ... May ? Where are you ? Shu-hoi 's case is now spread all over the field . The neighbouring station will send a crew to report it . Have you found Shu-hoi ? The boss is urging for the run-down . Come back quick ! All right , I am on my way back . Let 's

No one is allowed to enter without permission . I have a pass , but I left it with Hoi . Hoi ! Everyone should get my permission before entry . But I do n't know you . Reporters are not allowed to enter . Get out please . What machine is it ? My client has n't agreed with it . I just want to learn this game . On that day , I came to the forest alone . I planned to smoke and then commit suicide . I found the girl hung on that tree . So I took her down and put her right here . I did n't know she was already dead , so I gave her simple first aid and artificial respiration . My position was over there ... No reaction . Is n't it
zone1	Push it louder . On that day , I went into the forest alone . Louder , make it louder ... push to the end . What 's wrong with you ? Push to the end ! Please , please tell me , ls he the murderer ? Patrick Wong , this is the last time I ask you , Did you kill Chan Fong ? Detective Ha , I must state myself clear first ... From this second , I am not Patrick Wong 's lawyer . I admit guilty ! I killed her ! Mr . Shum , Patrick Wong finally admits guilty . It all counts on your lie detector . Can it tell what happened at the scene , or ... it brings people back to the time ... Will you two go together to study this mysterious forest again ? Yes , provided Mr . Shum does n't say no . We got the complaints transferred by the Broadcasting Authority . The programmes about ghosts must stop for a while . Do n't worry , we 'll start a programme hosted by May and Hoi
zone1	one should go in without permission . Reporters ca n't go in . Get out please . May ! May , have you found Hoi yet ? Okay , do it nowlet 's start I do it now . Come in . Sir . Here you are ! Take a seat . You can still call me sir until the end of this month . You look excited . Is n't it because you 're going to be free , or you like migration so much ? When talking to me , do n't talk like questioning Patrick Wong . I came to you with purpose . I must thank for your support . Actually , I must say thank you to you . I heard that you 're going into the forest for investigation . Are you really interested in the mysterious forest ? Yes . Patrick Wong is only one of the murderers . You can go ahead until the end of this month . For what will happen , the next commissioner will decide . Are you Leung ? I want you to help . And I
zone1	! Boss , he said he 's interested in investing money for our research . We are willing to invest and to join the project ... Excuse me . Yes ? Shu , it 's May 's speaking , what are you doing now ? I am now in a meeting . We have n't seen much in these days , huh ? I know , but my business has just been started . Now , a firm is going to invest on us . Shu-hoi , I have something important to tell you . My producer wants you to show in my new programme . Do n't mention your new programme again , okay ? I have many new things started , many people came for me . I am sorry ... excuse me . I ... May I call you later ? I am in meeting . Bye . Now , the watches wo n't stop like this . They stop either because of humidity or out of battery . If it is out of battery , the LCD monitor wo n't be shown . Have you seen
zone1	watches stop . Unless it meets extremely strong magnetic disturbance . See , it is out of battery . But there is still LCD show out . Hello ... Detective Ha . Yes . Dead bodies are found in the forest again . What ? Another dead body is found in the forest . I 'll be right back . Give me back the watches . But you promised to treat me to lunch . What caused this look ? Apparently , no obvious signs of struggling . She is seemed to be scared to death . Who found the dead ? It 's reported by Tin , an officer of the forest substation . Thank you . ( Godwillleadyouout ) What is the wooden board for ? The boards are for persuading people not to commit suicide . Who did it ? Those are all made by Tin . Mr . Tin really knows this forest very well . You know very well at where and when the people got killed . I can tell solving Patrick Wong 's case ca n't even satisfy you . Back to the
zone1	It has nothing to do with the girl 's death . I wonder , do you know the cause of her death ? In last two weeks , I saw her entering the forest . I did n't feel anything strange on her . I am afraid she would get lost , so I asked her to stay . But she did n't listen , she ran quickly instead . Then , I lost her sight . So you mean in this week ... You have n't seen her again ? Are you suspecting me ? Or , are you used to ... Suspect those who found the dead body ? I 'm just used to not to categorize anything from its appearance . Who is this guy ? A person who thought the mysterious forest can help to solve problems . Detective , let 's stop right here . It 's going to pour , if you do n't leave now , you 'll be trapped in . Detective Ha , it 's dangerous to go in for the mysterious forest . The mystery in the forest ... is
zone1	) ( Name : Tin sing-ye ) ( FileName : 475-KC-698457 ) ( EmploymentPeriod : 1962-1965 ) Detective Ha , five more corpses were found in the forest . All watches are stopped ! From my judgment , the five dead bodies ... their times of death do not exceed 48 hours . From the five of them , I can only identify one . This is Lee Shing-chun , I have already contacted his family . Granny , have my condolence ! Do n't be so upset ... I ... Well , is he your son , or is he your grandson ? He is neither my son nor grandson . He is my elder brother who has disappeared for over 40 years ! ( **31;355;TOOLONG . ) Tin ... Tin ... Tin ... is that you ? Have some tea to calm you down first . The mystery in the forest ... is not understandable by ordinary experience and science . What have you just seen ? Did you see something you 've always wanted to see ? I remember you once said , never categorized according to
zone1	It is not an illusion . This is my dear daughter . This is her spirit-tablet . She went into the forest to kill herself . I heard that , for those who committed suicide , at the place he got killed , his soul would keep on appearing . And keep on repeating the killings . So poor ! Later , I quitted the police 's job , I came to the forest . I hope to find my daughter back . I want to help her rest in peace , not to suffer again . So I keep on fixing the wooden boards round the forest . Hope the people who came for suicide ... hope them see the boards and get reflected . Think of his family . Think of his parents . So you come into the forest to fix the wooden boards every day . This is a kind of self comfort for l fail to get relief from my daughter 's death . Actually , you know something ? More you miss your daughter , more you make her soul not getting rest .
zone1	tomorrow , now you tell me Shu-hoi wo n't come ? All right , he can be exempted from being the host . Ask him to be the guest to round up the show . Just giving face to his girlfriend , okay ? I tell you , if you do n't make Shu-hoi to show up tomorrow , You 'd better go into the forest to kill yourself . It 's time for me to get on air . May , I have got informed that ... Your boyfriend is now working with the female cop for a forest investigation . Is n't it the reason he does n't have time to entertain you ? At that time , Patrick Wong lost control . We have reasons to believe that he 's lost his mind . And we have strong reasons to believe that ... He is disturbed by some energy which ca n't be explained . Let 's watch it again . We have reasons to believe that he was obsessed . He must be obsessed by ghost ! You tell the public that this is the truth
zone1	at all , so I need your help . But you ca n't bluff in this way ! Well ... You can tell them tomorrow . Why do you bring with the machines ? I want to test the signals of death in the forest . My machine is not for spirit calling . I am a botanist , not an exorcist . I did n't ask you to do anything . I just ask you to say something . I just want to tell the truth , something about science . For science , it 's not trying to hypnotize others . You remember what I said before ? If I got enough evidence to prove my words true , I want you to be the first one to shut up ! Ghosts , huh ? You are free not to help me ! Just let me die . You will not die . But I will not help you either . To so many people ... The mysterious forest means wonders and weirdness . It makes many people lose their family and friends . Even lives . Are

Other than wonder and weirdness of the mysterious forest ... Living people are wise of not getting near . Cut ! What 's up with you ? You wasted us two hours ! Again ! As from the official report , there are still 1 6 people missing . This labyrinth under the sea ... Cut ! No , thanks , no more make up . What a bitch ! You achieved nothing !

zone1	! Hello , yes ... Mr . Shum , this is the producer of May . She went into the forest while filming , she lost ! What happened to her ? Tin , we need your help ! I am sorry , I ca n't help you . Because , there is no map for the forest . Actually ... lt 's ridiculous , you always go in to fix the wooden boards . The wooden boards are useless . So tell us how you can get in and out so freely . If only you have God in your heart , if only you believe you can see what you want . And , not being affected by the appearance . Detective Ha knows it very well . I am in a hurry , sorry for bothering . Even the search party dares not search in midnight . I worry that you 'd get lost before finding May . Trust me again . She will be okay . Okay ? She is still in the forest ! You think she is okay ? Mr . Shum , there
zone1	to rain soon . Detective , do n't worry Mr . Shum . For those who can still raise their heads when facing difficulties , God would sure help them . Thank you . But he is not a person longing for God 's help . Since May is n't looking for death , she 'll sure be fine when you find her back . Hope May can wait for us . For people who do n't give up their lives , the forest will take good care of them . Has the forest taken good care of your daughter ? Always ! I think ... you 'd better not following me . You know the places . Are you worrying that I 'd bother you , or do n't you want me to help ? No , actually you helped me a lot . At least , my faith got recognized because of you . My faith is ... I would stick to the matter which people think impossible . Without trying , I wo n't admit a failure . From Patrick Wong 's case , you 've never

Why it is you ? May is possible inside . Do n't shoot ! They do n't mean to harm . They ? Who are they ? They wo n't want May , because ... May does n't want to die . They just want people who want to commit suicide ... for experiment . What experiment ? What did you say ? Because they do n't understand ... why mankind give up lives for affection . Tin ... Tin ... Tin ... Tell me where May is . Tell me where May is ! I want you to

First , I must thank my better half . Because of an experiment , it brought me this reward which is out of my expectation . And the result proved that .

" " You feel sorry for yourself a lot , do n't you ? " " I do n't think so . " - " No , you do . You always have . " - " Oh , God . " It 's amazing

And I suppose I love you . " But I 'm having trouble working up sympathy for your unhappy childhood . " " Here we go again . You had to wear my hand-me-downs , right ? " " Well , did n't I ? Did n't I have to wear all your old clothes ? " I had one new dress in a five-year period . " Was n't just the clothes being second-hand , they did n't fit . " The sweaters were all too small . " I was so embarrassed about having large breasts . " Then with your tight sweaters accentuating everything ... " " They made you real popular . " " It 's not the way I wanted to be popular . " - " But I was , was n't I ? More

" " Shut up ! " - Too much ? - Too talky . Sounds like bad Tennessee Williams . Breasts too large , Richard ? Every female character you create has breasts too large . But I make them suffer for it . I think I 'll take my obviously inadequate body into the kitchen ... and get some more caffeine . Let 's lie down and discuss the next scene . It 's 11:00 . - What is it ? - I ca n't tell you . I have to show you . Is it visual ? It 's visual . Very visual . Is it funny ? If you want to laugh , it 's okay . - Can we take a break afterwards , honey ? - Yes . You know , writing is so
zone1	to see Larry Weisman . Okay . Just turn left , then right , and you 'll be there . Thank you . God , it 's been six months and I have n't found the right color for that car . - That car is driving me crazy . - Yeah , it 's driving me crazy , too . What are we gon na tell him about the book ? We 'll tell him we 're not writing the screenplay . Good . You tell him . I 'm not gon na tell him . It 's your turn . You 're gon na tell him . I do n't want to . Please ? You tell him . You 're better with words than I am . - So what do you think about the book ? - It stinks . Paula ? Well , I think ... I do n't think that it makes a screenplay , Larry . - Do we ? - No . Good . I was just testing you . You guys are honest with me . You 've got integrity .
zone1	is on the phone . - He wants to know if you can play tennis ... - Yeah , I know . No , I do n't have the right tennis shoes with me today . Shall I tell him that you do n't have the right shoes ? No , do n't tell him that . I 'll speak to him . Hello , Bobby ? I would love to play with you today . No , I ca n't . It 's my kid . He 's very ill . I just would n't be able to enjoy myself today . I just want to stay here by the phone in case I 'm needed at home . That 's very sweet . No , there 's nothing , really . Okay , Bobby . Bye-bye . They 're gon na be wrapping our movie in about two weeks tops . - Great . - How 's it look ? I love it ! Please . - It all works . - Yeah ? - Remember the hassling about the ending ? - Yeah . I love the
zone1	tone ... the way it moves , the way it flows . I think you 're gon na be real happy with it . - Can we see it ? - No , you ca n't see it . The director does n't work like that . But trust me , it is good . It is damn good . Look , I want to do a new project with you guys . Come on , let 's talk here . I like you . You like me . I think we got a pretty good combination here . These are good . This is exactly what I wanted . This is exactly it , okay ? Good work . I knew you would get it . Just got to be a little patient . Oh , boy . It feels right . This is ... Oh , boy , I like this . Carol ? - Is he coming back ? - No , he 's gone now . What does he really think about the movie ? I do n't know . He has n't seen any of
zone1	on . You guys moved into your new house yet ? We still got a little work to do . Buying a house together means you 'll probably be getting married . We 're gon na try that new restaurant across the street . How is it ? I do n't know . I have asthma . - Your table 's right this way , gentlemen . - Thank you . This place is just a little overdone , do n't you think ? I mean , what is this , mulch ? Honey , do you think Larry lies about everything ? Probably . Carol said he had n't seen it , which means he 's lying about having seen it ... rather than having seen it and then lying about whether it 's good or not . What ? Thank you . - You have trouble finding your way back ? - We just leave a trail of crumbs . Enjoy . A bit scary buying a house , is n't it ? Words like " escrow " ... - It 's a nice , strong adult word
zone1	is sensational . - Try some . - I got some . No , I put it together much better than you do . Come on , try it . See ? Tastes good . We 're good together , are n't we ? Funny , Carol thinking we 're getting married . You know , tradition . You buy a house , you get married . If you think about it , I mean , you know ... we rent our house , we lease our car , we live together ... Do you feel there 's a lack of commitment there somehow ? I committed to a house . - What are we doing , Paula ? - What ? Buying this house , living together ... nagging at each other , not nagging each other ... making love , not making love ? For God 's sake , Paula , we act like we 're married . Richard , I thought we made an agreement a long time ago ... that we would live together . And if we changed our minds , then we 'd see
zone1	n't . If you were my age , you 'd understand . All right . Let 's wait till I 'm your age and then we 'll discuss it . Paula , there 's some statements I want to make with my life . You 're one of them . Living with you just says that you 're my lover and my friend . It does n't state you 're the woman I intend to spend the rest of my life with . Marriage makes that statement . Marry me , Paula . - Honey . - What ? I do n't know what to say . Let 's talk about it later , okay ? That 's great . That 's perfect . They moved into their dream house and they dated happily ever after . I 'm gon na lose Richard . What are you afraid of ? I do n't know . I just keep thinking that life is in three stages . That you 're born , you get married , and then you die . Wait a minute . So you think that if you
zone1	like that . - Do me a favor . - Yeah . - Put him down for me . - Sure . I 'm not very good at this . Anyway ... You know , I associate marriage with having to grow up . Now we 've already done that . Why have it rubbed in our faces ? And another thing . You spend your whole life trying to achieve a little personality ... a little individuality ... only to get married and be referred to as someone 's wife . A missus . Mrs . Richard Babson . No , thank you . No , thank you very much . What is this , a Manhattan ? - With lots of cherries . It 's good . - God . I have n't had one of these in years . - It 's so adult . - Yeah . Can I have another drink ? Listen . All of the reasons are all well and good ... but what it comes down to in the end is whether or not you love him . - I love him
zone1	gon na have to resolve it one way or another ... or you 're just gon na destroy the relationship . See , the ... I forgot what I was talking about . - My life . - I 'm sorry . It sounds to me like Richard wants marriage ... more than you do n't want marriage . Now , he is willing to try more ... Yeah , he wants it more strongly ... than you do n't want it . What ? What what ? What did I say ? You said that I want ... No . Wait , you said Richard does n't want ... No , you said Richard wants ... - Does Richard want something ? - What ? You said that Richard wants something . That he wants something . What does he want ? - Who ? - Richard ! Was it possible ? Could it be ? Then a lizard ran across all their paws ... but they all held their ground . Honey , remind me to call home later tonight . All was silent , except for a
zone1	of smoke , and a magician appeared . I feel like something is wrong . " Aha ! " he chortled and exhorted . And then , with a wave of his magic chew-stick ... their flea collars started spinning around on their necks . The collie got so frightened , he peed on the spaniel 's leg . Hello ? What ? I feel like something 's wrong . I 'm worried about my folks . They 're just getting old , honey , that 's all . I know . I think they 're gon na die soon . - Paula . - It 's possible . So I just practice . - Practice ? - I pretend they 're dead ... and then I really get myself very unhappy ... you know , and then I feel the grief . And then I guess , it 's just , I 'm preparing for when it actually happens . Let me get this straight . You kill your parents off in your mind so you wo n't feel bad when they die ? That 's how much I
zone1	You 're beyond Black Irish . Honey , let 's go back East . My parents are celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary . I 'd like you to meet them . Before they die ? Yeah . I do n't know . I do n't think I 'd do too well with your parents . Why not ? Your preoccupation with death . I just have to assume you 're the tip of the iceberg . I 'm gon na take a shower . You did n't stay to hear my whole idea . I 've been thinking about what you said . And ... You know how I feel about change . I 'm not very good at change , you know that . And I 'm not impulsive , you know . Who is this ? Richard , it 's very hard to be serious in a shower . Please help me . What do you want ? I 've had a lot of time to think it over ... and I think we should ... - What ? - Go ahead and do it . Do what
zone1	Get ... Get ... married . Are you sure ? - I did n't push you into this ? - No . I love you , Paula . Honey . If we get married , would you promise me one thing ? Anything , darling . We wo n't tell anyone . The limousine what ? The limousine pulls up in front of a three-story building . A nondescript building ... sitting in the middle of ... No . Sitting ... Among the buildings , among ... - Up against ... ... steel structures of ... No , in the countryside . Isolated countryside . - Yeah . Isolated ... - That 's good . Better .

It means if you 're Spanish and mad , you can marry in 10 minutes . That 's it . Where is it ? " 12722 , Alvarado Street . " Half a block south of the Burrito King . " That 's perfect . It 's on the way to the train station . Nobody will see us . Help me . You know , maybe we should fly . I 've been thinking about this . Three days on a train . Three days to think about meeting your parents . Trains are so romantic . Remember Giant ? Remember the scene on the train with Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson ? Love in the Afternoon , with Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper . Remember ? Remember Teresa Wright in Since You Went Away ? Teresa Wright did n't get on the train . Honey , you 're going to love it , I promise . God ,

Everything 's gon na be better . - We 're even gon na write better . - Good . Right , we 'll get better . Yeah , that 's wonderful , honey . That 's great . Because if it does n't , you know , I 'm gon na have to kill you in your sleep .

The Los Hermanos Wedding Chapel ? - What 's she saying ? - I do n't know . Of course , you realize what you are about to do ... is a very serious step . It is not to be taken

No offence , but ca n't I meet your parents some other time ? - I 'm too old to meet your parents . - There they are ! There she is ! Mom
zone1	Hi , Daddy ! Richard . Mom , Dad , this is Richard . - Welcome to the family , Richard . - Thank you , sir . - Richard ? - Yes ? You married our little girl . Yes . Thank you . - We 're in a lot of trouble . - I almost forgot . I brought you your oranges . Your favorite kind . - All the way from California . - The one's from Florida are juicier . Do n't pick up the black one , sir , it 's very heavy ! Richard , do n't bother . It 's the Irish Martyr Syndrome . - Let me take something . - Mother , stay there . Do n't flip . I 'm fine . - How do I look ? - Disgusting . Thank you . - Okay . Let 's go . - Come on , Richard . - Mom , hold this a minute . - What are you going that way for ? We 'll go to the end of the platform and take the stairs . It 's
zone1	What are those glasses ? - It 's nothing . - I had a cataract operation last month . - Why did n't you tell me ? Your mother thought it was best for you children not to know . Children ? The only problem is now I have no depth perception . Your mother is like a cat with a bell around its neck . You can tell where she is by the sound of something crashing to the floor . You poor thing ! Good idea to come up these stairs . A lot faster . Jesus Christ ! It 's even cold inside . - Dear God , it 's cold ! - Hell , this ai n't nothing . I never felt it cold enough to wear an overcoat . Mother , be very careful . It 's icy here . You must call Mary Theresa as soon as we get home . Mother , I 'll call her when I want to . She 'll be deeply hurt if you do n't . Mother , please . All right , I 'm sorry . I
zone1	this is your first visit to Buffalo , Richard ? Yes , sir . Very interesting city . One thing about living in L.A . , you miss that beautiful snow . Snow kills . You should see Buffalo when everything 's frozen . Everything is frozen , Mother . Where are we going ? This is n't the way home . Tom Hanrahan died last week . Your father wanted to stop at his funeral for just a moment . Tom Hanrahan ? Dad , I thought you never liked him . I hated the son of a bitch . I knew you were just the tip of the iceberg . I 'll be back in a second . Ellie , stay in there . It 's very slippery out here . I 'll be back . - How do you think your father looks ? - He looks fine . Why , is something wrong ? Well , you know ... since his stroke , he 's been a little strange . He hardly ever talks . And I found some ... pornographic magazines under his socks .
zone1	that word ? Excuse me , I think I 'm going to get some air . You do n't have to go . You are part of the family now . I appreciate that . It 's just that I get a little claustrophobic in a car . I do n't know if it 's me or what ... but there 's nothing between us anymore , sexually . Do you have any idea what 's wrong ? I suppose when you 're with someone for so long , they become so familiar ... that one day , you just forget to do it anymore . - Is it still that important to you ? - Yes . I love sex . It feels funny to be talking to you like this . All you ever told me about sex was that when it was right , it could be wonderful . Even when it 's wrong , it can be wonderful . - More tea ? - Thank you . I must say it scared the hell out of me . - My brother Patrick was a fine doctor
zone1	brother Patrick was a man who respected life on all levels . Richard , give you an example . Turtle soup . Loved turtle soup . Made it from scratch . Now , here 's what I am talking about . He was n't the kind of man who 'd just take the turtle ... and toss it into the boiling water , or crack its shell ... or whatever it is that would cause pain to the turtle . - You know what he 'd do ? - More pie ? - No , thank you . - Paula , get Richard more pie . You 're a married woman now . Start doing a little for your husband . Mother , he does n't want any more pie . And if he did , he could get it himself . He 'd take that turtle into the cellar , place it on the ground ... and he 'd go over and sit on the other side of the room on the floor ... with a bottle of bourbon and a rifle across his knees . And he 'd
zone1	he 'd sit , and he 'd wait . And he 'd wait for that turtle to just pop its head out ... from underneath that shell . The moment it did , pow ! Blow its head off . No pain to the turtle . Soup for Patrick . I used to play the cello before I was married . Patrick was patient man . You have to be patient to play the cello . Not an aggressive instrument . You know what , Richard , he always got what he waited for . I was quite promising . I played with musicals here in Buffalo . We were going to tour all Europe ... - Mommy used to say ... - I met Paula 's father . I 'm sorry . - Did I interrupt ? I 'm so sorry . - No . You go ahead . - No , I finished . Really . Go ahead . - No , please . Well , I 'll help you clean up , Mother . Thank you . Mommy used to say , " Why ca n't you
zone1	Patrick ? Patrick was Patrick , and I was who I was . But I 'll never forget that . Patrick . Mommy used to say , " Timmy , why ca n't you be like Patrick ? " Honey ? Honey , you all right ? No , I am not all right . You have strange parents , you know that ? There 's not a double bed in this whole house . Only single beds . Just single beds . Does n't anybody sleep together in this place ? - These are n't single . They 're antiques . - No , that 's a single bed . I am on my honeymoon . I want to sleep with my wife . - We 'll sleep together at your folks ' house . - Are you crazy ? That 's a week from now . I know it sounds crazy , but if we slept in the same room ... my parents would think we were having sex . - Really ? You 're acting like a teenager . - Well , this is my teenage room
zone1	it 's a room for slumber parties . Paula , I want you to listen to me very carefully . We 're on very shaky ground here . Very shaky ground . What do you mean ? Well , getting married is a very traumatic experience , right ? - Right . - My coming back here to Buffalo ... to meet your parents . That 's traumatic , right ? - Right . - All right . No matter how old you are , you 're still a child to your parents , right ? Right . You know what that makes you right now ? - What ? - A married baby . - You 're sick . - So let 's go to bed . Let 's take a shower together . You can soap me down . You can soap me up . Paula ! Are you upstairs ? - Honey , I can't . - What ? What do you mean you ca n't ? We 're married . I know , but I feel funny with my parents and everything . - I do
zone1	make noise . - I wo n't make noise . Sweet dreams . Dear God ! Is that the way it 's going to be ? For Christ 's sake ! Freezing to death . Sleeping in a bed ? Good Lord . Yes ? - Are you comfortable ? - Yes . I 'm fine . I put some towels and a washcloth in your bathroom . - Is there anything else I can do ? - No , thank you . Have you any laundry that needs washing ? Any dirty underwear ? No . Well , I just wanted a moment to tell you how happy we are . Paula is very precious to us . I love your daughter very much . That 's all that matters . Nightie-night . Would you like me to leave the hall light on ? No . Good night , then . Sweet dreams . I ca n't take it anymore . I 'm not used to this . I 'm not used to the cold . And I am not used to being sexually deprived . I am standing
zone1	my mother , she 'll put a mitten on it . I am not kidding , Paula . If we left before Mom and Dad 's anniversary , they 'd be very hurt . My father ! He 's killed himself ! Goddamn pigeons ! Filthy creatures ! Why do n't they stay downtown where they belong ! Oh , my God , Daddy , you scared me to death . I hate pigeons . Look at them fat bastards ! Bastards ! Breakfast , everyone ! Damn filthy sons of bitches . That dirty , dirty ... Crapped all over the roof . I think I winged one of them , though ! Come on , now . Hurry up . Everything 's hot . Mother , he 's scaring the neighborhood half to death . He 's like his brother Patrick , only not as good a shot . - He should n't do that . - It 's all right . He never hurts anything . It gives him something to do . That 's right , Richard . Just sit down . - Daddy , are
zone1	had a little something . I 'll be upstairs taking care of a few things . Excuse me . - Mom , is Dad all right ? - Yes . This is the time of day he locks himself in the bathroom with those magazines . - Can I help you ? - No , you just relax . I 've got a surprise for Richard . Grits ! I made you some grits . - Just the way you southerners like it . - Thank you . I hate grits . What will I do with this stuff ? She 's been up since 6:00 making them . You are gon na eat it . Happy-go-lucky you , saying it over the grapefruit . Why do n't you eat it ? Come on . She 's so happy . You have to eat it . Ca n't do this to her . Richard , how do you like it ? It 's very good . I called Mrs . O'Leary for the recipe . She 's very interested in your work in Hollywood . I told her about the
zone1	a screenplay . It 's for the movies . - Does that look like I ate some ? - No . - Let me have your napkin . - What ? Oh , God ! That 's disgusting ! You might as well finish it . No one else here eats this stuff . I 'm so thrilled about our anniversary celebration . It 's going to be a lovely party . Richard said that he might have to go back a little early . Oh , dear . Richard , is that right ? We have to do some rewrites . I do n't know what to say . It would just kill your father . Last night he actually cried like a little boy . He was so happy that you two had got married ... and came back to help celebrate our 40th . Well , I ca n't possibly tell him . Richard , could you do it ? It is n't definite that we have to go back . There 's a possibility that I could make a call . I 'm so happy !
zone1	on ceremony here . Daddy , Mom and I are going out shopping . We 'll be back around 3:00 . If Richard comes before then , would you tell him ? - Do you need anything ? - No , nothing . - Goodbye , Mrs . Riley . See you later . - Goodbye , Daddy . So long . - Shoot it . - All right , you guys . Another face-off ! Never play for the Sabers like that . Let 's hustle . Be careful , Mother . Here . - Eleanor ! - There 's Mrs . O'Leary . I want to thank her for the recipe . I will be right back . Mother , wait , let me take that . You go on in now . I 'll be fine . Be careful , Mother . Mother ! Get away from me ! Quiet ! Someone will hear you ! Get away from me ! Daddy , what are you doing ? - It was a mistake . I slipped on the thing . - It was n't my fault .
zone1	on . That man is insane . Please try and understand my father 's been very sick . He 's had a stroke . I am going to get out of here . As soon as I finish those other rooms . I always finish the job . Where you going ? What 's wrong ? Go back to the house . Leave me alone . - I need to ... - What ? - I do n't know . - What happened ? I do n't want to tell you now . - It 's your parents ? - No . They 're fine . Just go back to the house . And do n't tell them ... Do n't say any ... Do n't ask them what 's wrong , okay ? Please do n't do that . Yes ? My , it 's hot in here . Your father told me about the maid . Are you all right ? Are you ? Yes . That was our third maid . I think it 's wonderful he keeps trying . You are some old broad . Do
zone1	frightened you about marriage . Everything frightens me about marriage , Mother . It must be frightening . At least in my day , we knew what the roles were . But if you love each other , that 's all that matters . Marriage is n't to blame for what happened this afternoon with your father . That was just old age . Father Time has a way of just beating the shit out of us . You 're right . Paula ? I 've gone blind . Honey ? - Are you ready ? - Yeah . How do I look ? Great . Turtle soup . - What a wonderful story . - What do you mean ? Your dad 's story about turtle soup . It 'd be great in one of our scripts . He 'll recognize it . - I do n't think so . He 'll be very hurt . - Maybe you 're right . - I feel very bad about tonight . - Honey , it 's just a simple party . - It 's no big thing . - It
zone1	'm fine . Everything is fine , really . - Hurry up ! Party 's already started . - Coming ! - Let 's go . - Tell me what 's the matter . It 'll only take a second before we go down and see everyone . Nothing 's the matter . I think it 's time for a toast . This is it ? This is the anniversary party ? I think you 'll like the champagne , Richard . Upstate New York , tough little grape . Thank you , sir , and congratulations . We 're flattered to be on your guest list . You know , Richard ... I always found that parties where you have guests are such a nuisance . I 'd like to toast two of the most wonderful people in my life . Thank you for everything . I love you . I think there can be nothing more fitting on this ... our 40th wedding anniversary than to ... welcome in the next generation of loving couples . So , here 's to our wonderful daughter , Paula ... and
zone1	in your next 40 years together ... as Ellie and I have been in ours . And success with your new play . It 's a movie , Mother . It 's so big . Biggest condominium in Virginia , honey . Eighteen thousand people , all under one roof . Really ? God , I wish you would 've told your parents we got married . I 'll tell them , honey . I 'm waiting for the right moment , that 's all . - I 'm gon na tell them . - Okay . I 'm nervous . Of course you 're nervous , but they 're nice people . You 're gon na like them right away , and they 'll love you . Here we are . I 'll get it ! Just a second ! - I 'll get it ! - Oh , my God . It 's my mother . - Close your eyes . - What ? - Hi , Mom ! - Hello ! - Come on , Paula . - My baby ! - It 's so good to

Your sister 's here with the kids . - Nellie 's here , great ! - Not so great . She 's moved in . She and Derek , I do n't think they 'll make it . Derek is Nellie 's third husband . Why did n't you tell me Nellie was here ? We would 've stayed at a hotel . Do n't be silly , there 's a convertible sofa in the den . I trust you two sleep together . Tom ! Richard 's here ! Nellie , where are you ? Boys , come on . Give your Uncle Richard a big kiss ! Uncle Richard , oh , my God ! - How are you ? - I 'm fine . This is Paula . Paula , I 'm so pleased to meet you ! I 've heard so much about you . Everybody hold still . Tell me something , Richard , which

You did n't use the access road off of 70 and cross Leesburg Pike ? No . I used to be with the Federal Department of Transportation . I was with them for 36 years . I made all those access roads . As a matter of fact , that 's why you should use access roads after 4:00 p.m . You do away with bottlenecks . The traffic moves right along . And you do n't pay tolls . When are we gon na see this movie that you and Richard wrote ? As I was saying , before we had to sit down to dinner , the man never stopped talking . He just went on and on . - You never pay tolls . - I pay tolls . If there 'd been some compensation ... That 's my word
zone1	he had a pee pistol the size of Robbie 's here . Like that . Nellie , I do n't think the dinner table is the proper place ... to talk about the size of Derek 's pee pistol . Do you always have to be the guardian of good taste ? - Paula , am I offending you ? - Well , no . - There . You see ? - She 's being polite . After all , what can she say ? Annie , is n't it quicker to come by Riker 's Tunnel ... instead of the interstate ? Say something about it . Do n't just nod . - Yes , it 's quicker . - Hold it ! I have an announcement to make . I 'd like to say something . Go ahead , Richard . I do n't know if this is the appropriate time to say this or not . But I do n't know if there 's ever really an appropriate time to say this . But we 'd like to ... Paula and I , we 'd like to
zone1	- You do n't have to . I can guess ! - You 're engaged ! - I told you , Mother ! Who 's engaged ? They 're engaged ! - They 're engaged ! - Hold it . We 're not engaged . We 're married . What a surprise . I hope you 're pleased . Of course we 're pleased . It 's just that we 're just taken aback ... - you understand ? - I understand . It must feel very funny hearing about it after we 've already done it . I think it 's wonderful . It 's like the life cycle . As someone dies , a baby is born . I 'm getting divorced , you 're getting married . Out with the old , in with the new . Mother , now do n't you think it 's wonderful ? Well , our dinner 's getting cold . Why do n't we all just eat up ? Do n't any of the windows open in this place ? I do n't know . The whole condominium is temperature-controlled .

Did n't you have any oxygen when you were growing up ? - What is your problem ? - I do n't know . - I 'm just tired . - Yeah ? Oh , God , I 'm tired . I 'm sorry , honey . Have you noticed that you 're tired on a queen-size bed ? I mean , my family , people of this house , they sleep together . They just have to take turns breathing . Yes ? Mom , please . Someday you 're gon na thank me for this . - Paula , are there any wedding pictures ? - No , Mrs . Babson . Something has to be recorded . This could be the most important time of your life together . Mother likes to record every moment possible . - Grandma ! - All right , dear . They want to know if they can play video games till it 's time to
zone1	... This is not a great time . - It 's fine . They can come right in . - Thank you . - Can I borrow Richard for a second ? - Fine . I want to talk to him about something . Now , I do n't want you boys bothering Paula , you hear ? Okay . - Gon na be okay , honey ? - Your turn 's over . I 'm fine . Just fine . Dang ! Where are the pinwheel cookies ? Daddy hides them from the kids . They 're over the fridge . I love pinwheel cookies . You know , you ca n't get these out in L.A . What did you do that for ? I 'm so furious with you , I 'm beside myself ! What 's wrong ? How dare you deny us the opportunity of seeing our only son get married ! No warning . No chance to do anything , to send you anything . Not a present , not a card . Not a phone call to wish you well ! Your father
zone1	He plays cards every night . Well , he went early tonight . He 's absolutely heartbroken . I would n't take it too lightly if I were you . The man 's getting old . - Mother . - No , do n't touch me . I 'll be fine . I just need some time . Oh , my God . Hello . Who 's calling ? Who ? Just a minute . It 's for you . Larry somebody . Hello , Larry . What do you mean , where am I ? You called me . Excuse me . You 're in New York ? Look , we 'll be back in L.A . on Sunday . Sunday ? Does he know you just got married ? Larry , they 're not gon na shoot the scene ... - Just tell him you 're on your honeymoon . - Another week . No , we 're not gon na cut our vacation short ! We 'll rewrite it when we get back . Goodbye , Larry . You 're on your honeymoon . How am I

Come on , Richard . I want to record the worst day of my life . Go on . - This is ridiculous . - You have to hurry , Richard ! Shoot it ! - Go on . - How do you do that ? - Uncle Richard . - Out . Richard , want another English muffin ? I 'd love one , Mom . Why do n't you get it ? She likes doing things for me . - Here , I 'll help you . - No . You 're gon na have plenty of time to do things for Richard ... so you just take it easy . Richard and I have lived together for a long time . He knows how to do those things for himself . I 'm sure
zone1	Now that we 're married , what ? Mother , I have no idea what I 'm going to wear tonight . - Paula , what are you wearing ? - Why ? Where am I going ? - To the party ! - To the party ? What party ? I forgot to tell you , honey . The folks are giving us a wedding celebration . A nice idea ? Why , what a lovely idea . Something simple at Clyde 's Restaurant . A few friends , a few relatives . You remember that real pretty dress I brought with me . Where is it ? - Why did n't you tell me ? - Again ? It happens every year . I hung it very carefully in the closet . - All right , then . That 's where it is . - No . It is n't ! - What time is it in California now ? - It 's 7:00 . I 'll get it !

They 'll understand . Maybe if it 's that important , we should , honey . - When do you need the pages ? - Sunday , latest . Tell us what you want . We 'll do them here , and bring them on Sunday . I do n't think we can work here . I think we should go back . I 'll tell you , Paula may have a point . - We 'll do it here ! - Here 's good . Wherever 's good for you . It does n't matter to me . But Sunday , promise me , okay ?
zone1	The changes . One last thing about the ending ... when the characters leave the building , they have to walk off into a fake sunset . - What are you talking about ? - A fake sunset ? Why ? Jean-Claude wants it to be surrealistic , kind of like Coppola . So that at the end , we 're not sure if any of it ever really happened . I would love to stay and celebrate . I 've got to get back to New York . I left Kenny at the hotel . See you . What are we gon na do ? When do we start writing ? Saturday . Richard , do we have to go to the party ? Do n't start , Paula . It was very sweet of your parents to do this ... but do we actually have to show up ? Look . I know you do n't want to make a big deal out of this marriage ... but to my parents , it is a big deal . So would you do me a favor ? Would you

Here , I 'll give you some air , Paula . - I 'll give you air . - What are you doing ? - You want air or you want to talk ? - Stop it . - What do you want ? - I want ... - I want to take a shower . - Then take a shower .

Paula , congratulations . I 'm Ron Barbero . I handle all the Babsons ' insurance . Now that you 're married , if you need anything , give me a call . Paula ! Do n't move ! You know how crazy it is ? You 're getting married now ... and the rest of us are getting rid of our first wives . You and Barbara are splitting up ? What can I tell you ? Nice talking to you . There . That will be a good one . Thanks . You 're a darling . That 's real sweet . - Hi ,

Living together for three . - No wonder you 're not in a hotel room . - Oh , you 're bad . Are you planning to have children ? - I do n't know . - Really ? You should think about it . You 're not getting any younger . Excuse me . Richard , what is it ? What 's wrong , dear ? Paula . Where you going ?

I want you to keep this with you until we get back to California . Any time you feel tense , you take one of those . When we get back there , we 'll sort it all out . I do n't want another scene like we had tonight . Not here . I 'm sorry . I guess you think I 'm pretty cute . I guess you 're pretty crazy about me , are n't you ? I 'm in a bad mood .

The one's with rings around the necks are Canadian geese . The other one's are mallards . I thought ducks went south for the winter . Not all of them . Some get too old to make the trip . I like to help out a little . - Mom thinks we 're playing golf . - Yeah . So you got married . I guess you 're too old for a father-and-son talk . Try me . - Are you kind ? - Yes , sir . - Patient and understanding ? - Try to be . - Got a sense of humor ? - Thank God . - Know all about sex ? - More than you . Do n't be so sure . - What do you think ? Did I pass ? - Nope . None of those things got a

We should 've had your nails wrapped . Men love long red nails on their backs . - How 's your chicken salad ? - What ? Your salad . Is it good ? Know what I was thinking , Mother ? Now that Paula and Richard are moving into a larger house ... - I was thinking about ... - I was thinking the very same thing . - You were ? - Only we 'll have to coordinate it , though ... so we do n't both impose at the same time . I mean , you 'll be wanting to take the boys with you . About time they learned to swim . - Can I get you anything else ? - Nothing more for me , thank you . - No , thank you . - Sure . What would you like ? Can I get you
zone1	's another thought , Mother ... before you say no , you give it some consideration . If Paula and Richard did have the extra room ... it might be a good idea if we all went out together . That way we could drive . So if I wanted to go out at night ... and you could baby-sit the boys . Of course , not all the time . Some nights I could bring the date over to the house ... Nellie , that 's one hell of a long trip . I just hope you do n't think your father 's gon na do all the driving . - The man is old ... - Did I say Dad had to do the driving ? All I 'm saying is how 're we gon na ... - I 'm talking about planning a nice trip ... - We ought to ... - What 's the matter with her ? - Oh , my God ! She 's fainted ! Get a what ? I want you to go get the car and get Richard . Quick .

And then I could n't remember when I took the one before ... so I guess I took another . I 'm sorry , honey . There 's a leak in the bedroom . I just got a pot to put under it . - What the hell is going on here ? - What ? - Where did I park my car ? - What ? - Where did I park my goddamn car ? - Probably out front . - Oh , my God . What happened ? - We got married . That 's what happened . I told you marriage would screw up the relationship . That 's not what screwed up the relationship . - Here , put this on . You 're soaking . - I do n't want it . - Richard , please do n't

Tell me why . Because we got married , that 's why . That 's what does it . Marriage . - What marriage ? - Our marriage . We never had any marriage . We went right from the ceremony to separating . No marriage . What was that two weeks back East , Roman Holiday ? We were married then , and it ruined everything . That was no marriage . That was two weeks in a cradle . Poor baby does n't like being tucked in . Does n't like having to shovel all that mean old snow . Look at you , trying to kill yourself in a tearoom . I was not trying to kill myself ! No , you just had to take 14 Valium to get through your pastrami on rye ! I did not have pastrami

He 's right here in the office with me . I like to give Karen a break every once in a while . You want to say hello to Kenny ? He 's a big boy now . He talks and everything . Hold a second . Kenny , honey , come here , say hello to Uncle Gil . Sorry . All of a sudden he 's shy . Does n't want to come to the phone . Okay , I 'll talk to you later . Yeah . Lunch soon . Promise me , okay ?
zone1	Bye-bye . Okay . Where is it ? We ran into a little snag . We 're not quite finished . Snag ? You guys ran into a little snag ? I have a $10-million movie here with no ending ... because you guys ran into a little snag ? Only writers use words like that . Snag . A snag you have . What 's a snag ? You promised ! You guys promised me ! We separated . I 'm really very sorry to hear that , but what 's that got to do with my movie ? I want those pages . I do n't think we can work together . No , do n't tell me that . I do n't want to hear that . No ! I am going to put you guys in an office right next door here ... and I want to see the new pages today . Got that ?

An empty , darkened hallway . You think there 's going to be a crowd ? It 's 4:00 in the morning . He appears to be confused . He stops at the door to Jacobson 's office . He listens . There 's no sound from within . He then very slowly takes his hand ... Are you dictating ? - It sounds like you 're dictating . - I 'm not dictating . - You got the ending all worked out ... - You can jump in any time . Thank you very much . That 's very nice of you . What do you want to say ? I 'm not saying it was n't all right . It 's your attitude . You 're treating me like a secretary . I 'm very sorry . Would you like me to type ? Yes , I

He does n't have to be walking down a corridor . It 's all right if he does . But what 's going to happen afterwards ? We were just getting to that . No , you were getting to that . We 've never discussed it . Let 's just discuss it now . Sit down . We 'll talk about it . He 's in the corridor alone , right ? So ... I do n't know . Either he has to go into Jacobson 's office or into his own . So what do you think ? Hello ? Do you have something to say ? I 'm thinking . How am I supposed to know that ? You 're staring . What am I supposed to stare at when I 'm thinking ? When you think , you stare .
zone1	I 'm thinking " ? Oh , please . Forget it . What the hell are we going to do ? Just because our relationship 's in the toilet ... does n't mean we ca n't work together . Hi , how 's it going ? Where are we now ? In the corridor . We 're still in the corridor ? He 's on another floor ! Good . Listen , kids . Karen and I went through some pretty rough times together , too . Commitment . Discipline . Make it work . I 'm gon na kill him . I 'm gon na kill him dead . I 'm gon na take his head off ... I 'm gon na chop it up in little pieces . I 'm gon na grind him down . I 'm gon na step on him ... and then maybe I 'll feed him to the dog . Oh , God ! I 'm going to tell Larry we ca n't do it . Come on . It 's one stinking scene . We 've been here since 11:00 this morning

You want me to tell him we ca n't write two lousy pages ? I 'll tell him . Larry , we ca n't write two lousy pages ! There . You feel better ? All of a sudden you know just what to say . You 've got all the words to put together now . - What 's that supposed to mean ? - That for the last 14 hours ... you have not contributed one thing to this scene ! I see . This is what you wrote . You like that ? You wrote this , too . Is n't that great ? Are you proud of what you wrote ? Is n't this nice stuff that you wrote here ? You like it ? - Yes , I like it . - Do you want it framed ?

Did you think he 's stupid enough to lock us in here ? - Is the door locked ? - Yes , it 's locked . - lf it 's locked , he locked us in . - How do you know he locked us in ? Because the door is locked . Is the door locked ? Yes ! So we ca n't get out ! Did you try to get out ? Yes . And you could n't get out . So it 's locked ! Do you understand the word " locked " ? That means you ca n't get out ! I need air . She does n't understand the word " locked . " - L-o-c-k-e-d ! Locked ! - Air . Air ? You want air ? I 'll give you air ! Here . There 's air ! Come here . Stick your snout out there ! Are you getting any air ? I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , Paula . Let 's not go through any more pain . We

I 'll always be your best friend . But that 's not who I wanted to marry . When you get married you 're supposed to ... have romance and passion and all that . We did n't have any . Yes , we did . We had it all . Then why could n't we just have left it alone ? Because I loved you so much ... I wanted to say it to the whole world . You did n't want to marry your best friend . I did . We had it all , Paula . That could have been the best exit line of your life . I know . I forgot it was locked . I guess you 're stuck with me . - I said the perfect ... - I know . - Then I went to the door
zone1	I said ? - I did . Every word . - I said I loved you . - I love you , too . I was n't going to leave . I was gon na go somewhere and call you . I know . - I have a wonderful idea . - What ? How would you like to make love to a married woman ? Maybe . Come on . Why do n't you try ? I 'm told we 're great . I 'll do my best . You were right . Leo and Jacobson do n't have to go into the corridor at all . They do n't even have to go in the building . I do n't give a shit . You will . This is good . Wait till Kenny reads this . Two weeks , tops . Leo 's out in the corridor . No , he 's in . No , he 's out . Good . He goes out of the corridor , leaves the building ... English

We 're , uh , small . In order to survive , we have to give people ... something they ca n't get anywhere else , and , uh ... and we do that . But do n't you feel such shows contribute ... to a social climate of violence and sexual malaise ? - And do you care ? - Certainly , I care . [Chuckles] I care enough , in fact , to give my viewers a ... a harmless outlet for their fantasies and their frustrations . As far as I 'm concerned , that 's a socially positive act . What about
zone1	, I think we live in overstimulated times . We crave stimulation for its own sake . We gorge ourselves on it . We always want more , whether it 's tactile , emotional or sexual , and I think that 's bad . Then why did you wear that dress ? - Sorry ? - That dress . [Chuckles] It 's very stimulating , and ... and it 's red . You know what Freud would have said about that dress . And he would 've been right . I admit it . I live in a highly excited state of overstimulation . Listen , I 'd really like to take you out to dinner tonight . - You 're beautiful in that dress . What do you think ? - Professor O'Blivion , do you think erotic TV shows and violent TV shows ... lead to desensitization , to dehumanization ? [Max_Murmuring] The television screen has become the retina of the mind 's eye . [Murmuring_Continues] - Yes . - That 's why I refuse to appear on television , except on television . Of course , O'Blivion
zone1	's my television name . Soon all of us will have special names , names designed to cause the cathode ray tube to resonate . - [Max] Yes , I am , actually . - Yes . - I am very interested . - [Nicki] , is [Max] Renn a menace to society ? I 'm not sure . He 's certainly a menace to me . - [Screaming] - [Static] [Max] When does the plot , uh , start to unravel here ? I mean , who is this black guy ? Is he a political prisoner ? - There 's no plot . - [Man_Moaning] It just goes on like that for an hour . - Goes on like what ? - Like that . - Torture , murder ... - [Air_Hisses] Mutilation . - We never leave that room . - Nope . - It 's a real sicko . - Brilliant . - For perverts only . - It 's absolutely brilliant . I mean , look , there 's almost no production costs . You ca n't take your eyes off it . It 's
zone1	do this ? - Oh , help me . I think he wants it . - Come on . It 's worth checking out . Did you have any trouble locking onto it this time ? Not after I realized the Malaysia delay was a plant . It 's not coming from Malaysia ? You can not fool the Prince of Pirates for long . Har ... [Harlan] , where is it coming from ? - Pittsburgh . - [Screaming_Continues] That 's in the U.S.A . Pittsburgh . - [Screaming_Continues] - Pittsburgh . - Get professional help . - [Woman_Caller] But it 's not me . - It 's my sister . - It 's not your sister . It 's you , lover . Ca n't ya tell ? Is n't that why you called me ? You want help . You need help . You 're going insane . I can hear you disintegrating while you talk to me . - I 've got your number , have n't I ? - [Woman_Sobbing] I hate my sister . [Sobbing] I do n't want to . It 's ripping
zone1	do . - [Sniffles] - Will you call our Distress Center ? Will you call the CRAM Distress Center ? They 'll tell you where to get help , lover , and you need it . - You need it now . - [Sobbing] I will . I will . Oh , thank you , [Nicki] . [Hangs_Up] [Announcer] We 'll return to [Nicki] Brand ... and the Emotional Rescue show in just a moment . This is CRAM in Toronto , and we 've got the weather for you . - Got any porno ? - You serious ? Yeah . Gets me in the mood . What 's this ? " Videodrome . " - Torture , murder . - [Chuckles] Sounds great . Ai n't exactly sex . Says who ? [Water_Splashing] [Screaming] - God , I ca n't believe it . - I 'll turn it off . No , no , no . It 's okay . I can take it . FloggingContinues , [Woman_Sobbing] Can you get it any clearer ? It 's a pirate tape . They scrambled it . [Moaning_Continues] I like
zone1	me on . Take out your Swiss Army knife and cut me here ... just ... just a little . Looks like somebody 's beat me to it . WomanGrunting , [Screaming] I wonder how you get to be a contestant on this show . I do n't know . Nobody ever seems to come back next week . What did you say happened to your shoulder ? A friend . I think he 'd like Videodrome . You let somebody cut you ? - Uh-huh . - [Moaning] , ScreamingContinue What do ya think ? Well , I-I do n't know . You wan na try a few things ? NickiExhales , Hisses [Nicki_Sighing] Oh . Oh . [Moaning] [Sighs] [Chuckles] [Nicki_Moaning] [Max_Moaning] **33;184;TOOLONG [Max] , thank God . [Masha] Borowczyk has been in your office for an hour . - [Masha] . - What were you doing last night ? Did n't you get my message ? - I do n't think I 'm ready for this . - Coffee . - Cigarette . Office . [Masha] . Go . - All right . [Masha] . - She
zone1	it ... Apollo and Dionysus . [Max] [Masha] , does it ever get good ? It 's all good . - Darling , I am looking for something a lot more ... - [Woman_Giggling] Contemporary . I want something that 's gon na show people what 's really goin ' on under the sheets . This stuff is too ... It 's too naive . It 's too sweet , like you , darling . Well , it 's your market . Do you know a show called Videodrome ? - Video-what ? - D-R-O-M-E . Videodrome , like video circus , video arena . - You know it ? - No . It 's just torture and murder . No plot , no characters . Very , very realistic . I think it 's what 's next . Then God help us . - [Knocking_At_Door] - Better on TV than on the street . Arnold on line three . You interested in , uh , tracking it down for me ? I 'll see that you get the agent 's commission . I 'm interested . Let me try
zone1	your own show ? Right here ? I could be your agent , worldwide . I could sell subterranean for you everywhere . - No , I do n't have the temperament . - But if you did , what kind of show would you do ? I mean , for the subterranean market . Would you do ... Videodrome ? [Nicki] [Max] . - Mm-hmm . - I 'm goin ' away tomorrow for two weeks ... on assignment . Guess where ? L.A . - Pittsburgh . - [Chuckles] Fabulous . - Do n't stay in the sun too long . I hear it 's bad for the skin . - Oh , come on . Is n't that where they make Videodrome ? Yeah . Why ? I 'm gon na audition . I was made for that show . Nobody on Earth was made for that show . Hey . Listen to me . - Listen to me . - What ? I want you to stay away from it . Those mondo weirdo video guys , they 've got unsavory connections . They play rough
zone1	Do you understand me ? Sounds like a challenge . Got a cigarette ? It 's not a challenge . I swear . You know , in Brazil , Central America , those kinds of places , making underground video is considered a subversive act . They execute people for it . In Pittsburgh , who knows ? [Liquor_Pouring] [Max] . [Nicki] , do n't ! [Nicki] , do n't . Do n't . O/o/ [Drums] - Do you have a hangover ? - No . Stayed up late watching TV . Did you get in touch with our friends in Pittsburgh ? In a way . At a distance . - Subterranean grapevine . - And ? [Max] , Videodrome is something for you to leave alone . It is definitely not for public consumption . [Chuckles] Channel 83 is a little small to be considered public . It is still too public . Do you understand me ? No . What 's the punch line ? I think it 's dangerous , [Max] . - Videodrome . - Why ? It 's Mafia ? They do business .
zone1	How can I say ? More political than that . Come on , [Masha] . What are we talkin ' about ? Videodrome . What you see on that show , it 's for real . It 's not acting . It 's ... snuff TV . I do n't believe it . - o/o/ [Stops] - [Whistling] So ... do n't believe . Why do it for real ? It 's easier and safer to fake it . Because it has something ... that you do n't have , [Max] . It has a philosophy , and that is what makes it dangerous . Whose philosophy ? There must be a name . Give me a name I can talk to . [Masha] , [Masha] , you know me . I stay away from the scary stuff . [Max] , you are going to have to be nice to me for this . We can take a shower together , anytime you say . [Chuckling] I 'm sure you would be very beautiful , but , uh , you 're a little older than I prefer . Thank you
zone1	I 'll make Apollo and Dionysus part of the package . [Sighs] That hurts me , [Max] . Hey , the world 's a shithole , ai n't it ? Yes , [Max] . It is . Brian O'Blivion . That is the only name I have to give . Professor Brian O'Blivion . [Woman] Wait , where you goin ' ? Come back here . Hey . Hey , buddy . Got a fag ? - [Man] Are they goin ' in now ? - Got a cigarette ? [Indistinct_Muttering] - Got ta have a smoke and a cup of coffee . - [Woman] Wait a minute . They do n't serve coffee there . They just serve piss water . - [Muttering_Continues] - I do n't need to put up with this shit . I 'm a young woman . Take a good look at me . I 'm a good-lookin ' woman . I got nice tits . [Man] Let 's go . [Muttering_Continues] [TV_Noise] , Indistinct [Woman_Greeter] Hello . Move along . GreeterContinues , Indistinct [Female_Derelict] Move out of my way ! Hello . Straight down
zone1	. Keep going , keep going . Come on . Step along . - [Bianca] O'Blivion ? - Yes . I 'm [Max] Renn . I , uh ... I run Civic TV . I did a panel show with Prof . O'Blivion . The Rena King Show . Oh , yes . You said some very superficial things . Violence , sex , imagination , catharsis . - My exact words . - What do you want ? I wan na talk with your father ... about a new twist in video that he may not be aware of . I love the view . You look like them , like one of Father 's derelicts . [Chuckles] Think it 's a style that 's coming back . In their case , Mr . Renn , it 's not a style . It 's a disease forced on them by their lack of access to the cathode ray tube . You think a few doses of TV are gon na help them ? Watching TV will help patch them back into the world 's mixing board . Absolutely .
zone1	home movies ? The world 's mixing board ? Prof . O'Blivion sends video letters all over the world . - Is the Professor here ? - I am my father 's screen . Once you 've told me what this visit is all about , he may choose to send you a cassette . If he does , which format would you like ? If he does , it 's gon na make conversation a little difficult . My father has not engaged in conversation for at least 20 years . The monologue is his preferred mode of discourse . Format . Videodrome . Is that a Japanese configuration ? - You 've never heard of it ? - No . Then there have been serious gaps in your education . - Videodrome . - o/o/ [Clock_Chiming] Mention it to your father . He may want to have a conversation . [Chuckling] I love the view . [Door_Closes] [Harlan] Torture , murder , mutilation . [Masha] Videodrome . What you see on that show , it 's for real . [Nicki] I 'm gon na audition . I was
zone1	you do n't have , [Max] . It has a philosophy , and that is what makes it dangerous . [Knocking_At_Door] Hi . This is your wake-up cassette , and this came to the office for you by courier . - What did they say at CRAM ? - They said that [Nicki] Brand ... is definitely not on assignment for them . - She had a month off coming and decided to take it . - Do n't touch that ! [Grunts] [Grunts] Jesus , [Max] , you scared me . What the hell 's wrong with you ? I do n't know , man . I think I 'm gettin ' , like , a rash or somethin ' . - Uh ... - What ? Are you all right ? Bridey , I did n't mean to hit you . Hit me ? You did n't hit me . No ? No . No , I know I did n't hit you . I meant ... - [Exhales] - Do you want me to stay here ? - Uh ... - You look awful . - Can
zone1	uh ... No , I 'm just , uh ... Uh , I 'm ... [Exhales] I 'm exhausted . I was in a deep sleep when you knocked , and I guess I 'm still not out of it . And I guess I 'm still not out of it . I 'll remember to set the timer . Do n't worry . - You 're sure ? Are you sure ? - I 'm sure . Yeah . Thanks , Bridey . Tomorrow . [Max] , that other cassette is from the office of Brian O'Blivion . I promised I 'd hand-deliver it directly to you . Will you call me if you need me ? - [Sighs] - [Gasps] TapeLoads , Clicks The battle for the mind of North America ... will be fought in the video arena : The Videodrome . The television screen is the retina of the mind 's eye . Therefore , the television screen is part of the physical structure of the brain . Therefore , whatever appears on the television screen ... emerges as raw experience for those who watch it
zone1	less than television . - [Chuckles] - [Max] . I 'm so glad you came to me . I 've been through it all myself , you see . Your reality is already half video hallucination . If you 're not careful , it will become total hallucination . You 'll have to learn to live in a very strange new world . I had a brain tumor , and I had visions . I believed the visions caused the tumor ... and not the reverse . I could feel the visions coalesce and become flesh . Uncontrollable flesh . But when they removed the tumor , it was called Videodrome . I was the ... [Choking] L ... I ... was Videodrome 's ... first victim . But who is behind it ? What do they want ? I want you , [Max] . You . Come to me . Come to [Nicki] . Come on . Do n't make me wait . Please . [Breathing] [Nicki_Moaning] [Breathing_Deeply] [Nicki_Moans] I want you , [Max] . You . Come on . - Come on . - [Breathing_Continues] Come to me
zone1	n't keep me waiting . Please . Please . [Siren_Wails] [Announcer] Today Lady Luck may smile on these four players ... and start them on the road to $12,000 ... We have a new group of people coming in this afternoon , so tell the staff about that . - All right . Good . - [Audience_On_TV_Cheering] [TV_Noise_Continues] Exciting . Very lively . Careful . It bites . - You watched the cassette ? - Yeah . - It changed my life . - I 'm not surprised . It 's dangerous , you know . Because your father admits he 's somehow involved with Videodrome ? More than that . It bites . Is n't that what you said ? What kind of teeth do you think it has ? It triggered off a series of hallucinations . I woke up with a headache . - First time ever ? - No , I-I 've been hallucinating for a while , - ever since ... - What ? Since I first saw Videodrome . How did you come to be exposed to it ? Pirate satellite dish . A-An
zone1	of my own Videodrome collection . But that tape is just your father sitting at his desk . The tone of the hallucinations is determined by the tone of the tape 's imagery . But the Videodrome signal , the one that does the damage , it can be delivered under a test pattern , anything . Mmm . Damage ? The signal induces a brain tumor in the viewer . It 's the tumor that creates the hallucinations . You let me watch it ? I expect them to come to me eventually to hurt me . I thought it might be you . Now I realize you 're just another victim ... like Father was . Where is your father ? I think I 'd better talk to him . He 's in there . O/o/ [Clock_Chiming] I 'm afraid he 'll disappoint you . This is him . - This is all that 's left . - What are you talking about ? Brian O'Blivion died quietly on an operating table 11 months ago . - The brain problem ? - The Videodrome problem . - You
zone1	panel show with me . On tape . He made thousands of them . Sometimes three or four a day . I keep him alive as best I can . He had so much to offer . My father helped to create Videodrome . He saw it as the next phase in the evolution of man as a technological animal . When he realized what his partners were going to use it for , he tried to take it away from them . And they killed him . Quietly . At the end , he was convinced that public life on television ... was more real than private life in the flesh . He was n't afraid to let his body die . [Sighs] Tell me about my Videodrome problem . My father knows much more about it than I do . Listen to him . Where 's [Harlan] ? He 's not in the lab . - I think he 's up in V.T.R . [Max] ... - Not now . - [Harlan] . - Si , patron . Have you been hallucinating lately ? No . - Should
zone1	I believe ... that the growth in my head ... this head , this one right here ... I think that it is not really a tumor , not an uncontrolled , undirected little bubbling pot of flesh , but that it is in fact ... a new organ , a new part of the brain . I think that massive doses of Videodrome signal ... will ultimately create a new outgrowth ... of the human brain , which will produce ... and control hallucination ... to the point that it will change human reality . After all , there is nothing real ... outside our perception of reality , is there ? [Chuckling] You can see that , ca n't you ? [Phone_Rings] [Rings] - [Man] [Max] Renn ? - Yes . - Who is this ? - Barry [Convex] would like to talk to you about Videodrome . I 've got a car waiting downstairs for you , sir . Please direct your attention to the television set in front of you , Mr . Renn . Mr . [Convex] has recorded a little introduction for you .
zone1	Chief of Special Programs , and I 'd like to invite you into the world of Spectacular Optical , an enthusiastic global corporate citizen . We make inexpensive glasses for the Third World ... and missile guidance systems for NATO . We also make Videodrome , [Max] , and as I 'm sure you know , when it 's ready for the marketplace , things will never be quite the same again . It can be a giant hallucination machine and much , much more . But it 's not ready . Those were test transmissions you picked up . We thought nobody could tap into them . He 's good , that [Harlan] . Good pirate . Well , now that you have , I think we ought a have a little talk , do n't you ? I thought maybe ... my place ? - [Chuckles] - [Convex] I hope you realize you 're playing with dynamite . That 's our spring line . Top secret stuff . I brought it with me for a trade show here in town later this week . [Max] Renn , I
zone1	you 're wearing is ... too much for the shape of your face . Overwhelms you . T-Try something more , uh , spidery , more delicate . Here she is . This is our prototype . This is the little number that started it all . [Max] , I would like you to try this on for size . I would like to use this machine to record one of your hallucinations now . Then I would like to take that tape back with me to home base for analysis . Do I get to keep the copyright ? I mean , I 'd hate to see it show up as a Movie of the Week and not get paid for it . [Max] , I 'm trying to help you . What makes you think I need help , Barry ? None of our test subjects has returned to ... normality . They 're all in need of intensive psychiatric care . Now , you seem to be functioning reasonably well ... so far . I 'd like to find out why , and I think an analysis
zone1	place to start . Will it hurt ? It wo n't hurt you . You might catch yourself sliding in and out ... of a hallucinatory state after this is all over . If you do , just relax and enjoy it . It 'll soon go away . But for now , I think that you 'll find a little S-and-M ... will be necessary to trigger off a good , healthy series of hallucinations . - [Beeping] - That 's why our Videodrome show is so strange . Something to do with the effects of exposure to violence on the nervous system . It opens up receptors in the brain and the spine , and that allows the Videodrome signal to sink in . - You mean I 'm gon na have to hurt you , Barry ? - [Chuckling] ' Fraid not . You do n't have to actually hurt anybody . You just have to think about it . [Humming] [Humming_Loudly] Wha-a-a ... That 's too bright ! I ca n't take it ! - Yes ! I forgot ! Sorry ! How 's that ?
zone1	. Yeah , that 's fine . Okay , we 're rolling . The taping mechanism is all self-contained . You do n't have to do anything now but hallucinate . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . I 'll come back for you later . You 'll forgive me if I do n't stay around to watch . I just ca n't cope with the freaky stuff . [Max] [Nicki] ? - [Nicki] . - Well , here we are at last , right where we ought a be : On Videodrome . What are you waiting for , lover ? Let 's perform . Let 's open those neural floodgates .
zone1	breathing_heavily , [Moaning] [Nicki_Gasps] Aah ! Aah ! [Shouts] [Moaning] Aah ! [Gasping] Aah ! [Gasping] - Aah ! - [Panting] What 's going on , Prof . Oblivion ? [Chuckles] I mean , really . Oh . [Gasps] Oh , [Masha] . [Exhales] [Harlan] , it 's [Max] . Can you come over to my apartment ? Right away . Yeah , I 'm serious . Come on in . Well , here I am , patron
zone1	wan na be a centerfold ? I want you to go into my bedroom , and I want you to take a look at what 's in my bed . Uncover it . Do n't be shy . I want pictures . - Pictures of what 's in your bed ? - Yeah . Do it . Sure . Okay . Oh , God . [Exhales] Well ? [Max] . I do n't see anything . You did n't just want me to shoot your bed , pillows , sheets , You did n't just want me to shoot your bed , pillows , sheets , did you ? - It 's disa ... - [Max] , are you in some kind of drug warp ? I 've got friends who can help . Bridey said she came by a couple of days ago . You were ... Did you tape Videodrome last night ? If it was transmitted , the machine would 've caught it . I 'll meet you in the lab in one hour . I wan na see it . - Jeez , it 's not
zone1	! Do you understand me ? Well , fuck you . I 'm not some fucking servomechanism you can switch on . You want me to run around like an asshole , tell me what I 'm doing it for . - Otherwise , I 'll see you during office hours . - [Harlan] . You 're right . It 's momentum . I 'm runnin ' like an express train here . I do n't know how to stop . Look , I 'll meet you in the lab in one hour . Okay ? And then we 'll see if we pulled in any Videodrome last night ... and I 'll tell you what 's going on . Everything . I promise . Okay ? Okay . I 'm sorry if I freaked out on you . - I do n't work with you for the money . - I know that . With pirates , it 's never just for the money , is it ? You want a cup of cof ... No , look . I 'll meet you in the lab in an hour
zone1	look at the tape ? - Did you see me on Videodrome ? - There was no tape . - There was no Videodrome transmission last night ? - Not last night . - Aw , fuck ! - Not ever . What ... What are you talking about ? [Knocking_At_Door] I 'm out of my depth now , patron . I had to bring in the reinforcements . [Max] . An intriguing combination . Very interesting . - Do n't let me interrupt . - I think I was saying something like , " What are you talking about ? " I was playing you tapes , [Max] . Prerecorded cassettes . Videodrome has never been transmitted on an open broadcast circuit . - Not yet . - I guess Barry sent you here , what , two years ago ? It has been ... two years , has n't it , [Harlan] ? Two . Two wonderful years . Why ? [Exhales] To get you involved . To expose you to the Videodrome signal . It did n't affect you because you never watched it ! You knew
zone1	it . [Chuckles] It really does work on just about anybody . Anybody who watches it , [Max] . But why would anybody watch it ? Why would anybody watch a scum show like Videodrome ? Why did you watch it , [Max] ? Business reasons . Sure . Sure . What about the other reasons ? Why deny you get your kicks out of watching torture and murder ? You murdered Brian O'Blivion , did n't you , you freak ? Did you enjoy that ? North America 's getting soft , patron . And the rest of the world is getting tough . Very , very tough . We 're entering savage new times , and we 're going to have to be pure ... and direct ... and strong ... if we 're gon na survive them . Now , you and this , uh , cesspool you call a television station ... and , uh , your people who wallow around in it ... and , uh , your viewers ... who watch you do it ... you 're rotting us away from the inside .
zone1	na start with Channel 83 , [Max] . We 're gon na use it for our first authentic transmissions of Videodrome . I have a hunch it 's gon na be very popular ... for a while . I 've got ta be hallucinating now , right ? I mean ... [Chuckles] you two ca n't possibly be for real . Ah , we did record your hallucinations , [Max] , as I said we would . And we did analyze them . You 're ready for something new . That 's terrific . [Breathing] What do you , uh ... What do you want from me ? I want you to open up , [Max] . Open up to me . [Breathing_Continues] I 've got something I want to play for you . [Breathing_Continues] Oh , my God ! [Coughs] [Convex] We want Channel 83 , [Max] . - [Grunting] - Give it to us . Give us Channel 83 . Kill your partners . Kill them . Kill your partners and give us Channel 83 . [Grunts] , [Exhales] [Grunting] Aah . [Squishing] [Gasps] [Convex] Give us Channel

I 'll tell him you want him . Do n't . [TV_Noise_Continues] [Phone_Rings] [Man] We dub in a funny track . Gentle comedy . Mm-hmm . And you 'd be the one to write it . Yeah . Yeah , I would . I used to write in high school , then I lost it . Hi , [Max] . You 're just in time to throw some light on an interesting problem . Do n't . [Max] . What the fuck ? [Man] Jesus ! [Man_#2] It was from the boardroom ! [Max] , what happened ? Are you hurt ? - They killed ... They ... - [Gasps] What happened ? - They killed us ! - What happened ? - Jesus !

[Airplane_Passes_Overhead] [Lock_Unlatches] - o/o/ [Clock_Chiming] - [Door_Closes] [Footsteps] [Footsteps] [Bianca] O'Blivion . I run Civic TV . I was on a talk show with your father . So it was to be you after all . You 've come to kill me . No . No , I 'm [Max] Renn . I run Civic TV . I do n't ... I do n't kill people . Oh , but you do . You 're an assassin now for Videodrome . They can program you . They can play you like a videotape recorder . They can make you do what they want , and they want you to destroy whatever is left of Brian O'Blivion . They want you to destroy me . Destroy you ? TapeCassetteLoads , PlayerClicking [Bianca] They killed her , [Max] . They killed [Nicki] Brand . She died on Videodrome . They used her image to seduce you , but she was already dead . Do
zone1	for you to see . [Tape_Player_Clicking] Videodrome is death . [Gunshots] That 's better . So much better . It 's always painful to remove the cassette , to change the program . But now that we have , you 'll see that you 've become something quite different from what you were . You 've become the video word made flesh . [Exhales] I am the video word made flesh . And now that you are the video word made flesh , you know what you have to do . You turn against Videodrome . You use the weapons they 've given you to destroy them . Death to Videodrome . Long live the new flesh . Death to Videodrome . Long live the new flesh . [TV_Reporter] It was only 26 hours ago in the building you see behind me ... that a bizarre , apparently motiveless shooting occurred ... which has triggered off an intensive manhunt by Metro Police . Thirty-four-year-old [Max] Renn , president of the Civic TV Corporation , is being sought in connection with the shooting deaths of two executives at Channel 83 ...

There ai n't much to see here , but take your time and have a good look anyway . Ah , what this ? Yeah , this is one hell of a scrip you got here . Very tricky grind .

Father sends some goons down there to clobber the guy . Brings her back to the States and do n't let her back into his house . That was 4 years ago . That 's it ? Yeah , she ca n't even go to Brooklyn any more . Only unless it 's a special occasion ... weddings , funerals , stuff like that . We 're still friends . She 's in decorating . She did my apartment , real nice job she did too . That 's some family you got . Anyway ... I like you coat . Do you ? A coat like this ... stand out in New York , you know . My father always says it 's better ... to stand out because of how serious you are ... instead of clothes , cars or diamond rings ... For men that is . What am I doing all
zone1	at a Prizzi 's wedding ... and you ai n't no wop ? The Bishop who married them was n't Italian . No he 's a Polak . So am I . Walker is a Polak name ? No , it was Walkervisks . I shortened it . My maiden name was Irene Walkervisks . Either way ... you 're sure one beautiful woman to me . I guess I thought that Walker sounded more like a tax consultant should . You 're a tax consultant ? What do you do when you consult ? I save people money . Show them the angles . There are a lot of angles . This L . A corporation ... had a guy kidnapped in the Middle East ... so I told them they ran some money that was tax deductible staff loss . - Things like that . - Terrific .

I remember everything ... I read about it in magazines . When you 're just in love it 's just ... Wait a minute . A hormonal secretion ... which changes the senses smells . So as to affect someone in a certain way . That 's what in love is
zone1	I love you I think that 's sounds like I 'm hedging , but ... I do n't know how to say it because I 've never said it before . All my life I 've had to protect myself and ... you ca n't protect yourself from anything when you love somebody . I love you Charley . What 's that they 're playing ? That 's " Noche de Ronda .

I 'd marry you tonight Oh , yeah ! Have a cigar ! My favourites . From Mexico . Smell delicious ! Charley come in . You know Cyril , do n't you ? Hello Charley nice to see ya ' . - Wan na cigar Charley ? - No , thanks .
zone1	what happened at the big casino with those dirty bastards . I 've been President of the Prizzi 's casinos in Vegas for 20 years ... and I have never seen a scam like this before . I 've got 14 phony I.O . U They come to $722,085 . Now when the collectors go to pick up the money ... the player that signed the I.O . U is dead ... from some bad cold or something before he signed the paper . Or else he was someplace else and he was n't in Vegas to sign it . Every piece of paper is counter-signed , that 's house rules ... by Louis Paul , the acting manager ... and the man in the cage , Marxie Heller . They had to be working together . I do n't get it . Louis takes paper to the cage all he gets back is chips . - That 's house rules too . - Yeah . Now the big boss tells me there 's a woman in it . He says that he twice saw Louis ... bring two big
zone1	to cashiers window but he did n't think anything of it . So where 's Louis and Heller ? Louis caught it . A bullet in the head . Heller is hauled up in L . A He 's got a wife out there . They found Louis laid out in the front seat of his car ... in the parking lot of Leone 's bar way out on the street . I knew Louis when he was a helper on an ice truck 30 years ago . We taught him his trade . He was n't smart enough to figure a scam like this . So I guess the first thing to do ... is to find Marxie Heller . I remember him now . He always wore a silver toupe on the job . He had dark brown bags under his eyes as if he had coffee grounds in ' em . That 's him . He was good with figures , steady . But he got T.B . Charley ... Louis Palo was thief but he was ours . Heller must have iced him So you ice
zone1	? The Prizzis sent me . Where is your wife Mr . Heller ? She 's at the supermarket . And just who are you ? Charley Partanna . Where 's the money Marxie ? Straight arrow Charley . The old American hood . I do n't know what you 're talking about . Get up onto your feet ! Come on ! Put your hands up ! I think you broke my wrist . You wo n't need it . Come on ! I 'm home , dear ! Marxie 's not here , Mrs . Heller . Charley ! What are you doing here ? Why did n't you call first ? You always call first ! Charley ! Marxie Heller 's wife ? You married to Marxie Heller ? - Where 's the money ? - Money ? No bullshit . Your husband killed Louis Palo for the money , where is it ? I do n't know what you 're talking about . You 've knocked me for whoop here . - Where Is Marxie ? - Dead . In the trunk of his car .
zone1	your husband and Louis Palo ... scammed from the Prizzi 's in Las Vegas ? Maybe I ... I do know something about it . He had a bag with him . I 'll show you . It could be in here . It 's the only place I know it could be . You sure ? I 'm sure . I got $360 here . Half . Half ? Do n't keep telling me what I just said . Where is the rest of the money ? I did n't even know the money was there . How could I know it was short ? When Marxie came home three nights ago ... after being away from me for five years ... he threw that bag in the closet . That 's all I know . Did you ask him why he came back to you after five years ? Charley please try and understand . I was glad when Marxie showed up because ... it gave me a chance to ask him for the divorce . You wan na know what I remember ? I remember you coming
zone1	dear " . Is that the way you ask for a divorce these days ... Mrs . Heller ? Charley , I could see how sick he was . I did n't need to ask him . He only had a few weeks left . Oh , Marxie . In all the years I knew Marxie Heller ... he never yelled at me or hit me ... or stole my money . He was my friend . If it was n't for him . I 'd probably still be earning my living on my back ... with half of your pals in Chicago . It was his idea to study book keeping and ... he got me a job on the main wire too . Then he talked them into making me a courier . He told me to study tax laws ... while I was flying back and forth to Switzerland . He was always there for me , like nobody else in my life . And I loved him . Not like I love you , But I loved him . And that 's the Gods honest truth
zone1	do n't you just kill me and get over with ? I ca n't . I ca n't change the way I feel about you . I look at you ... and I see what I wan na see . That 's what love is . If you were anybody else I 'd blow you away . But I ca n't . I have to believe this . Well how 'd it go out there ? Okay . I brought back 360 dollars . How come only half ? I talked to Heller he wo n't say nothing . So I pay him off with a bing . Then the wife comes home . We talk . No problem . She 's brings me the money which she thinks is there ... cause he brought a satchel home with him when he came . I count . It 's only half . You worked her over ? No , she was scared . She knew I 'd tapped her husband . I think she was telling the truth . What happened to Louis split ? I do n't know Dominic
zone1	. Okay . When I close my eyes and you 're cooking , Charley ... I think your mamma is still with us . Thanks Poppa . Pop ... do you think Dominic believes that I copped that other 360 ? What the hell Charley . The money had to go someplace . Dominic hates your guts anyway . Yeah that 's getting real bad . He never lets up . He do n't eat right . He never eats like this . He 's got heartburn from that place he eats at all the time . They make garbage . It 's not like this . Well the man ca n't hate me cause he do n't eat right Pop . Charley ... believe me , I know how that mind of Dominics ' works . His life turned out miserable . He has to blame someone . Every time he sees you ... he 's reminded of the shame Maerose put on you ... on him , and on the whole family . You forgot . Not Dominic . He probably worked it all around so the whole
zone1	your head , out of your head . Great dinner Charley ! Now . What 's the occasion ? I wan na show you a woman . The one that I went to California to see about . Is n't she beautiful ? I like her . Kind of darker and more round woman myself . See you got a picture of me with her . - Pop what are you doing ? - Jesus Charley ! She was the one we brought in to make the Turbino hit . She was a speciality hitter . Charley let me give you a hand with the dishes . No , it 's ok . I 'll just stack . The girl 'll take care of that in the morning . Thanks . Alright . Then , I 'll just head on home . Getting late by my clock . - Great dinner Charley . - Thanks . - Goodnight Pop . - Night son . Thanks a lot . Maerose ? Charley . What is this ? It 's 00:45 a.m . It 's the second time you 've called me
zone1	I broke that vase . What vase ? That special vase that matches the rug . The one you knocked your self out trying to find . Charley what are you out of your mind . - You alone ? - Course I 'm alone . I got ta see ya ' . What 's with you ? We got ta talk . You wan na talk out here or you wan na sit down and talk ? Sure . Oh , this is a beautiful set up you got here Mae . The colours are right . That 's what counts . Everybody sees shapes differently but colours are forever . Yeah . Why 'd you call , Charley ? We wasted a lot of time Mae . Four years you call that a lot of time ? How come you did n't wait till I was 50 ? You could have been a fat wop broad by the time you were 50 . You wan na do it Charley ? Is that what you want ? Whoah take it easy ! What the hell Mae ! Nobody took
zone1	the question do you wan na do it ? Well , yeah . So ... let 's do it . With all the lights on ? Yeah right here on the oriental . With all the lights on . Mamma Mia ! Thanks . What 's your problem Charley ? It certainly is n't your God damned face . How can I tell you with all people ? But I got nobody else I can talk to . It 's about a woman . Go ahead . Tell me anyway . How can I feel worse than I used to feel before last night . We grew up together . We 're the same people . What the hell Charley , the calendar takes care of everything . I met her in a church . Just happened . I knew she was the woman for me . She 'd organised a scam in Vegas . I go looking for the bad guy and it turns out to be my woman . Can you imagine this ? Not only that . Pop tells me ... she 's the piece man for
zone1	love her Mae . I love her . Well . Can I live with this ? I got ta do something about . I got ta straighten it out . Then do . Do what ? Do I ice her ? Do I marry her ? Which one of these ? Marry her Charley . Just because she 's a thief and a hitter ... does n't mean she is n't a good woman in all the other departments . If she was some kind of fashion model it would n't last more than 30 days . But you and she is in the same line of business . You 're lucky you 've found each other . You know that Charley ? Yeah . She 's an American . She had a chance to make a buck so she grabbed it . Marry her Charley ... and at least I 'll be able to get something out of it . I 'll be able to go back in the family . Yeah . Thanks . Shall we have them play " Noche de Ronda " ? Yeah . Would
zone1	. Why ? I know everything . I know you made the hit on Turbino ... after the wedding reception when we met . I know you 've been scamming us with Louis and your husband . I did the work on Turbino . I had nothing to do with what Marxie and his partner did . Louis Paulo was so suspicious ... that he checked the car for bombs every time he started it . But he would have let some beautiful broad walk over get in and sit on his face . No matter how you got it in your head Charley , you 're wrong . I had nothing to do with it . Nothing . Charley . Did you mean it that first night when you asked me if I 'd marry you ? Charley ? Alright . The Prizzi 's are gon na have to believe me cause I believe you . So could we get married . What you say we have one of those pineapple drinks ? The honeymoon has already started . Kiss me Charley . In public ? Pop ? Charley
zone1	all . I 'm gon na get married . The same woman ? The contractor ? Yeah , she 's Polish ... but the family will get used to that gradually . Yeah , when she walks in a room ... the rest of the women of family are gon na have to shut up . But I know how you feel about her Charley . I 'd not try to stop nature . Good luck , son . - Thanks Pop . - Say . Listen . The Don wants you here for a big meeting tomorrow night . Jesus , Pop what about my honeymoon ? So you 'll have it in Brooklyn . Shit ! So what do you say we go for some confetti ... and maybe a couple of pictures ? Whatever you say honey . If only Marxie could see me now . What 's so funny ? Me marrying a Sicilian . I can hear him . He always used to say : " The Jews are bad enough in this business ... but the Sicilians 'd rather eat their children than part
zone1	children " . Marxie Heller is so fucking smart ... how come he 's so fucking dead ? Next . The man at the end of the table ... is Mr . Alvin Gomski . He 's Treasurer of 18 Lodges Bank in the United States ... of which we own 25 ? / ? . Now I asked Mr . Gomski to come here today ... so you can hear from his own mouth what has been happening . The bank president Mr . Robert Finlay ... is stealing from the bank ... mainly through crooked foreign exchange deals . If he 's allowed to continue ... the bank will go under in less than a year . Thank you Mr . Gomski . Harry go . See Mr . Gomski to his car . Robert Finlay 's real name is ... Rosario Filargi . Now anybody who changes his name from Filargi to Finlay ... is also stupid enough ... to think that we would n't protect our 25 percent . Tell them our plan Eduardo . We are gon na kidnap Filargi . He 's covered with
zone1	's the tag on him and we make the snatch . We know the insurance company is gon na pay cause ... as Charley has already pointed out ... that money is tax deductible We 're also gon na leave a trail ... so that the Feds think Filargi organised the whole thing . Cheating the bank , milking the insurance company . When the mierda hits the fan ... we 'll be able to buy another good size chunk of the bank ... for about 10 cents on the dollar . We get control and interest . Eventually ... we stand to make sixty seventy million dollars . Thank you , Eduardo , my son . Some men suffer most when you take their lives . Life is what is sweetest to them . For Filargi money is sweetest . We 'll leave him with his life and without money or anywhere to get it . Well done Don Corrado . That 's beautiful . I almost feel sorry for the guy . Beautiful is right . I like most beautiful things , Charley . This one is very
zone1	want me to handle it ? Pick your own people . We do n't wan na know . Dominic my son stay with me a moment . Maerose has written to me , Dominic . The man she wronged has married another woman . Now Maerose has suffered , Dominic ... as you have suffered during the years of her disgrace . Now honour is protected , I beg you ... on my knees ... show compassion . Here . Here read her letter . Look how the child loves you . She wants to take care of you . Send her to me Poppa . She 's my daughter again . What we got ta do is take care of the bodyguard ... and get Filargi down to our van in the basement . - Ok ? - Ok . There 's only three apartments on the floor . How are you gon na do that ? One of them is empty , this one we rent it . The other one , we send matinee theater tickets ... and heavy duty lunch invitation to the dame that lives
zone1	back . She thinks it 's a prize she 's getting ... for working at the public library for sixty years . She 'll go alright . Everyday Filargi 's bodyguard comes out first . He goes to the elevator , pushes the button . When he gets there , he puts it on hold . Then he goes back to the apartment and knocks on the door . That 's when Filargi comes out . You know guys , you need a woman on this stand . - A woman ? - Yeah . A woman comes out of the south apartment holding a baby . After Filargi 's bodyguard gets him out of his apartment . She smiles at them , she goes gogo gaga at the baby . She tosses the little darling at the bodyguard ... who naturally tries to catch it . While he 's doing that , she gets her piece out and covers him . You come out of the other apartment and take Filargi down to the garage . She takes the bodyguard back into Filargi 's apartment and does the job
zone1	we gon na get a baby ? Where we gon na find a broad who would do something like this ? Where ? Here , me . We get a fake baby . Good thinking Irene . You guys work it out . I got a terrific dinner almost ready . Just a couple of minutes . Pop , what 's the matter with you ? I did n't get married so my wife could go on working . Charley , she 's right and you know it . Throwing the baby . Well that 's strictly a masterpiece . The Prizzi 's ever found out I used my own wife on this job ... I could n't hold my head up . I 'd be the laughing stock of every family ... in Brooklyn and New York . Who 's gon na know Charley ? And what 's that compared to sixty , seventy million dollars . Gentlemen , dinner is served . - Maerose ! - Coming Poppa ! Jees Mae , you look awful ! My beautiful daughter has turned into an old woman . Charley Partanna
zone1	become part of the Prizzi family . He had no use for you . Oh , he had a use for me Poppa . He came to my place in New York the night before ... he married that woman in California . And he forced himself on me . And he did it to me . - He did it to you ? - Yeah , Poppa . Screwed me three times , maybe four . I ca n't remember . You whore . Shut your filthy mouth you here . How can you say such things to your own father . He done that to you , Charley ? - You sure ? - Am I sure , Poppa . You should see the size of him . - You should . - Shut up . How can you say such things to your father ? Where 's your honour ? Are you kidding Poppa ? I have no honour anymore . Here Poppa . - Good afternoon . - Good afternoon . Do you mind ? Catch ! I must have the wrong floor . Oh my
zone1	on ! Lets move them ! I had to hit her Charley , she was looking straight at me . You done right , really . I ca n't get over it . I mean what kind of creep would n't catch a baby . If it was real , it could have been crippled for life . He was n't the bodyguard of the baby . When the Don gets what he wants and when I ask him for some time ... we 're gon na go to the old country have a real honeymoon . Maybe even a real baby . Oh , God Charley , I love you . What do you want ? Come on ! - See you at dinner . - Ok , dear . Recapping our top stories at this hour . - Come on Charley . - Shut up , I wan na hear this . Police have now identified both victims . One of whom was a police captains wife . Shit ! The man found with her was the bodyguard ... of the bank President Robert Finlay . Finlay 's

They also believe that Victoria Calhain ... stumbled accidentally into the scene of the crime ... and the kidnappers ... Look at this . First she got ta push the wrong button . Then the broad turns out to be a cops wife . Call 's still waiting Charley . Yeah ? Hi , darling ! Were you watching the TV just now ? Yeah , a police captains wife . I could n't believe my luck . All hell is gon na break out over this , Irene . Cops do n't like it much when we hit one of their wives . But it was an accident . Mr . Ciglione ? Mr . Ciglione . Mrs . Prizzi would you like to come to my office please ? Mrs . Prizzi , would you care for a drink ? I 'll have a Babycham . Babycham ? You heard what the lady said .
zone1	Mrs . Prizzi ? I think I got something for you . Capulla ! Come on ! Sit down over there . That the broad ? Tell the lady . I was using this camper as a trick room in the parking lot . As I lifted up my head from the job . I saw this woman in hot pants ... running to the lights of the car where Louis Paulo caught it in the head . She 's in the car a couple minutes . Then she gets out and goes to the trunk ... takes out a satchel and then she fades . The same woman ? Yeah it 's the same one . Why do n't you go on one of those cruises , honey ? You 've reached the answering machine for 5554375 . Nobody can take your call right now . Please leave a message after the beep . Meet me on the promenade , Brooklyn 7pm tomorrow . Full price . I 'll be on a bench at the end reading " Popular mechanics " . Are you the contractor ? How much
zone1	is it ? A Brooklyn fellow , Charley Partanna . Charley Partanna ? Amalia told me that you wan na thank me ... for bringing you home ? Well , you are blood of my blood ! You 're flesh of my flesh ! And as long as I 'm able ... I 'm gon na think about your well being . Thank you , grandfather . You have drawn me back from purgatory . I wish you had been a son . You are a true Prizzi . Hey , you like to have a cookie ? It is I who must offer you a gift grandfather . A gesture of my gratitude . I have always enjoyed gifts . Who 's this handsome lady ? That is Charley Partanna 's wife , grandfather . Well ? My gift to you is not only the pictures ... but also what they mean . Louis Palo was killed in the parking lot in Las Vegas . I know . I took these pictures there . There was a woman who had been turning tricks in a camper ... in the
zone1	... get into a car with Palo . After a minute she got out , went to the trunk ... and took out a satchel . This woman ? Yes , grandfather . She killed Palo ... and she stole 720 dollars from us . She gave back half to save herself . What do you want me to do ? She dishonoured us ! You 're like me . We forgive nothing . What would that do to Charley Partanna ? She must pay like anybody else . Oh . What you ask ... that would cause Charley great pain . What is that compared to the honour of the Prizzi 's ? Charley is like my son . I pledged to be his second father on the day that he was born . - Grandfather . - Shut up . Have another cookie my dear . We 're here to tell you what we 're telling all the families in this town . All contracts are off ... until we get who ever killed Captain Calhain 's wife . How do you mean Davey ? It means nothing
zone1	. A police captains ' wife has been murdered . You got narcotics right ? Plus loan sharking . Plus horse books , football , basketball and boxing . Not to mention what you take out of restaurants in the trucking business . Plus a couple of millions in TV sets ... that fall of the back of a truck every week . We 're gon na put them all out of business , as of now . It 'll cost us hundreds of thousands ... but that the way it 's gon na be . I 've been doing business with the Police commissioners squad . For over 40 years now . We always went under one rule : You take our money , you leave us alone . The more pressure you put on us the more money you cost yourselves . There ai n't a cop on the squad ... who 's had to get by on straight police pay for a long time . Yeah . Look Angelo , our people do n't like this any better than you do . But this one 's a
zone1	Angelo ? You 're a fine looking woman . Charley Partanna is a lucky man . Thank you for coming . What a surprise you gave us with this sudden wedding . Well , we just sort of swept each other away . I understand , I was young once . This ... marriage of yours has troubled me . Why Don Corrado ? The people at Prizzi 's place in Vegas ... have looked at pictures of you . They 've told us that you killed Louis Palo . Now , under ordinary circumstances ... you would have to be punished ... cause those who steal must pay . You 're the wife of my God son . I 've searched to find some way to show you clemency . What can I do ? Well you got the other half of the 720 dollars ? Yes . Was Charley in this with you ? No . He believed me when I told him the half was Marxie 's split . He did n't know that I had anything to do with it or that I killed Louis .
zone1	the 360 together , give them back ... together with a 50 percent penalty ... for what you have done to us . Will five days be enough time for you ? Five days ? Yeah , I can get it together in five days . Irene ? Charley . How come you 're in L . A ? I had business to attend to , did n't you see my note ? Can you get out here this weekend ? I do n't think so . Tell me . Tell you what . Tell me I love you . I love you . Love you too , and it 's real . May not be scientific , but it 's real . Scientific ? I read it in a magazine . According to a doctor ... everyone is trying to get ... what they thought they needed from their mothers ... but they did n't get it . I do n't even remember my mother . That 's the amazing part . There 's something in you that knows anyways . The magazine said so . That 's what
zone1	you ... what you think you wanted when you were a baby ... but you did n't get it . A doctor wrote this . Charley forget doctors . Better yet , lets play doctor . On the phone ? Doctor Partanna I have this itch ... Well ? They 're not kidding around this time . It 's gon na get worse . They 're gon na keep leaning on us ... until we give them whoever it was ... that hit that Cops wife . All I know is that ... the cops tell us ... the guy who got snatched the day they did the number on the cops wife ... was in big business with the Prizzi family . I wan na make this a short meet . I wan na put it to a vote right now ... that Dominic Prizzi ... tells us what the hell he 's gon na do about it . Alright ? Raise your hands . Hold the hands . Who do you think you 're talking to ? I am Dominic Prizzi . When most of you people was
zone1	holding up gas stations . We was the biggest family in the country . And now most of you have figured out how to push broads ... we 're still the biggest . We lose more when the cops get in an uproar ... than any of you . Now we do n't like it ... but you ai n't gon na tell us how to run our business . We ai n't taking any shit from any outsiders ... about the family business ... especially from a scummy little pimp like you , Se ? or Bocca . I hope you like it ! Thank you . Padrino , you never saw anything like this here ... the broad pushes the wrong button on the elevator . The door drops just in the minute ... when the second man drops the bodyguard . The woman is standing there . She makes all three of us . She had to go . I 'm sure you did n't act without thinking . That 's why I called you here today . You 're a thinker . Dominic is a sick
zone1	no ease . He has got older . I 'm gon na move Dominic out to Vegas ... and make you boss . I 'm speechless Padrino . This ... is an honour ... beyond my dreams . What could I do to show my gratitude ? For the time being this must be our secret . You must not even tell your father . I do n't understand Padrino . We 'll announce everything once the Filargi thing is settled . Then Dominic will move out and you 'll move in . God , I missed you . So I gathered . What 's been happening ? Plenty . Just had a meeting with the Don . A private audience . Here . He wants me to take over . He says that Dominic is sick . They 're gon na send him to Vegas . I 'm gon na be the boss . Charley , that 's fantastic . I do n't know . Sounds fishy to me . Number one ... should have been Dominic told me ... instead of the Don . Well maybe the Don
zone1	he has or he has n't ... he would have told Pop . He do n't decide what Mass to go to unless he talks to Pop . Big deal like this they 'd go over every angle fifteen times . They did n't ? No . And worse than that . The Don says for me not to tell Pop . Wan na know what I think , Irene ? What ? I think they 're setting me up . I think you 're right Charley . I think they 're after our scalps . How do you know ? I got ta a couple of things to tell you . I went out to L . A on orders of the Don . He told me to bring back the money I took from Louis Palo ... plus 50 percent interest . So you did ice Louis Palo . You swore to me that you did n't . You lied to me . I lied to you because you wanted me to . I only told you what you wanted to be true . And I told the
zone1	I 'm so sorry . What 's the other thing you got to tell me ? Dominic has put out a contract on you . What are you fucking nuts ? No , Charley , I 'm the contractor . Dominic hires my own wife to clip me ? Charley he did n't know I was your wife . He just wanted the best . Charley ! Honey , let 's go to Hong Kong tonight . What are you talking about ? Let 's beat it while we still can . Beat it ? Yeah , scram , split , let 's make a run for it . Look I know this guy in Hong Kong who can give us ... new prints even new faces in a few days . We can get out of this crazy world , we can start fresh . We can be together all the time . Hong Kong ? Hong Kong , Brazil , South Africa . It does n't matter . What matters is us together . Listen , I 've been doing three four hits a year for the last
zone1	many ? Well it 's not many if you consider the size of the population . The thing is I got almost a million . In a safe deposit box on the coast . You must have at least that much put away . We can take all the money and make a run for it . We can go where we want , do what we want ... we can be together all the time . Please Charley let 's just go before they get us . They 're not gon na get us . Piss on the Prizzi 's . These people ca n't win all the time . There has to be a way to beat them . Bastards . Let 's call Pop . And the Don told you to keep making you boss a secret from me ? Yeah . And he told you he 's letting you off for giving him back the money ? Plus fifty percent . And Dominic gave you a fifty dollar down payment to hit Charley ? Absolutely . Brand new bills . Oh , he 's hot .
zone1	's just business , just business . What are we gon na do ? We have to take away the only thing the Don wants , Filargi . You have to snatch Filargi again This time from the Prizzi 's . How many people you got out there holding him down ? Two . My people , they do whatever I tell them . Good . Filargi is worth seventy million , maybe more to the Prizzi 's . Including the bank . So what are you next to seventy million dollars ? Nothing . They 'll take whatever deal you offer them . Yeah , no choice right . They know we can let Filargi go and testify against them . Or even worse ... you can try and go into ... the Governments witness protection programme ... and testify against the Don and Dominic . To a jury the colds facts would be you shot the Captains wife ... on orders from the Don and Dominic after they hired you for 150 dollars . You 're very dangerous to the Prizzi 's , Irene . Yeah . It
zone1	the police captains wife . It could solve all our problems . We 're here tonight to honour my son . He 's gon na leave us ... to live in a 935 dollar house ... next to his own golf course in Las Vegas , Nevada . And I said to him , from you , from my heart ... God speed you ! God bless you Dominic ! And I want to present you ... with these tokens of esteem from your entire family . Some going away presents . A complete set of Stealing silver golf clubs . That bag is made out of the hide of an elephant . It 's the only one in the United States . And one thousand of your favourite Mexican cigars . We 're gon na have a song ... in celebration of this grand occasion ... the great Tenor Tomas Innovarata . Get moving . Holy shit boss . Somebody done the job on Fingo . The Bocca 's . This killing of the Police captain 's wife is costing us all too much . I got something to
zone1	letter ? Who from ? Charley . You all set ? Dear Eduardo ... You 're probably hot right now cause we took Filargi . But when you hear the reason why ... you and the Don are gon na understand there was no other way we could go . Dominic put out a contract on me . He 's a fucking liar ! You wan na hear the letter , listen do n't talk . There 's a 130 million dollars here maybe more . We 've got ta renegotiate it before we get it back . Just shut up and listen . Go on , sit down . Go on . Dominic will say it 's a lot of bullshit . It so happens he hired my own wife ... and gave her a down payment of 50,000 dollars . And my wife is sitting right next to me and she 's laughing like hell . I personally think the Don found Dominic on a doorstep ... because he 's too dumb to be a Prizzi . The first thing I got ta have before you get Filargi
zone1	where I tell you and when I tell you . This time no contract , I 'll kill him myself . Listen to the letter will ya ' Dominic ? Come on . For the main money this is what I want . 23,014 dollars for expenses . Then 50 dollars for my helper . Of course the 150 dollars that was promised my wife ... as second man in the Filargi scam . Charley 's wife was the second man ? She was the only way we could take out the bodyguard . Then I want all the insurance coverage on Filargi 's kidnap policy ... which is two million five . - My God he 's a real businessman . - That 's my boy . We got ta make him an offer and eventually we settle . The way I see it , we get about 60 or 70 million dollars ... with about 5.9 ? / ? sales costs ... if we give Charley everything he wants , which we obviously wo n't . And I am part of the fucking sales cost . Dominic ...
zone1	is just making a point . Everything is negotiable . We go over to Poppa 's ... we hash this thing out . Come on ! Let 's go ! - Somebody is dead ? - Yes , Who ? Who 's dead ? Poppa ... Dominic . The Bocca 's again . Oh Dominic ! He got old ! Maybe it was his daughter , who knows . I agreed to retire him ... and I gave his job to Charley . I told him to keep this secret a little while ... until ... Dominic 's banquet . Now Charley is all mixed up ... and we got ta get him back . Only Charley can hold everything together here . How you doing Pop ? Fine , everything alright ? Yeah , everything 's quiet out here . That 's better huh . Sorry to drag you out here ... but I did n't want anyone taking a pot shot at me . When I told the Don about Dominic putting out contract on you ... it knocked him out . He could n't believe it .
zone1	got ta straighten all this out . He was n't setting me up ? He said ... and I 've known him for fifty years , so it 's like looking through his heart . He said : " We need Charley " . Oh , he said that ? The Don and me do n't have much time left . The family has to keep going . You 're the only one that can run it . Then everything is ok . We do n't have to hang on to Filargi . The Don gave me his guarantee . Tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock , you bring Filargi ... at 42nd Street library and let him out . I 'll tip off the cops and the FBI . They 'll be in his hotel room . Ok Pop , want the paper ? Na , read it from cover to cover . Jupiter was 6 at Vermont . Ok . By the way , the insurance company paid off . Take care of yourself Charley . How are we gon na take Filargi in ? Pop 's sending someone
zone1	transfer him into the van and I 'll drive him into the city . You stick with the plumber . He 'll drop you off at the apartment . Tell me about the money Charley . My end is 2,5 million ... plus I 'm boss of the Prizzi 's ... with heavy points in everything the family does . This time next week we 'll have all the money . You mean to tell me you 're gon na turn over a hole ball of wax ... to some Sicilians who are gon na pay you what they owe you next week . Honey I 'm the boss . They need me . I got ta believe Pop . They 're not gon na screw us over now . Well maybe Pop is in there looking after your interests ... but that does n't necessarily mean he 's looking after mine . There is a real pressure to turn over the second man . You 're my wife . I 'm your Polak wife . Irene will you shape up , jees . Ok , I 'll shape up
zone1	900 dollars ? The $720 from the Vegas scam ... plus the $180 that Don made me pay as penalty . That 's 900 dollars . I just want what 's mine . That 's Prizzi money honey , not yours . You stole . The Prizzi 's got theirs back from the insurance company . Now I just want it back . That ai n't gon na make no sense to the Prizzi 's , honey . Remember the words of the late , great Marxie Heller . We 'd rather eat our children than part with money . Remember those words , honey . I am Charley , I am . Mr Filargi ... you were born a poor kid in Naples right ? Yeah that 's right . You remember the Camorra ? The Camorra was small , we 're very big . There 's no where 's we ca n't go . They could lock you in a steel room ... in a submarine at the bottom of the ocean . And we 'd still get to you . The cops are gon na talk to
zone1	you , or where they took you . We 're gon na kill you . Capiche ? I understand . Good . You 're free Mr . Filargi , good luck . Yeah . I 've forgotten the Prizzi 's already . I got a request to make ... or Irene has . What kind of request Charley ? She wants her money back . What money ? The 540 she gave you for the Don . Plus the 360 I took the night I zipped Marxie Heller . That money . She 's willing to forget about ... 2,5 million for Filargi 's insurance ... and the rest of what Dominic owed her for the contract on me . But she wants her 900 back . With all the respect Charley ... your wife must be cracked . Try and see it from her point of view . I mean you agreed to all that stuff in the letter we sent ... when we had Filargi . You made a commitment , Pop . And anyways , it was Irene 's move ... that got Filargi out in the
zone1	. So , 900 does n't seem like so much money Irene figures she got it coming to her . I glad that she 's so foolish and grasping . Makes it a little easier what we got ta do . The family has decided that ... we 've got to give the second man to the cops . Give Irene to the cops ? The family decided that ... we got one week to give up the second man ... or we 'll be at war . War will cost us everything we got . And that could mean the end of the family . Well Padrino . You should never have married a woman who was n't in the environment . That was n't smart . Might have been alright if she was straight . But she was n't . She got ta go . And you got ta do the job on her , Charley . You 're the only one who can get close enough to do it . Zip Irene ? Clip Irene ? If they take her alive they 're gon na make her
zone1	na drag us all to jail ... maybe even to the chair . Filargi will go free and we 'll never get the bank . There 's no choice here . How is doing a number on Irene gon na satisfy the cops ... about the broad that pushed the wrong button ? Filargi will identify your wife 's body ... and there will be no-one to question . Everybody will get what they want ... and we can all go back to doing business . But Padrino ... she 's my wife . I ca n't kill her . Now , Charley ... you swore an oath of blood , my blood and yours . That you would always put the family before ... anything else in your life . I 'm simply calling on you now ... to keep that sacred oath . Irene is my family Padrino . She 's my wife . She 's a woman you 've known for only a few weeks . She is your wife . We are your life . You 're failing your oath ... when you covered up for
zone1	your honour . But this for this you must stone . I need her . Look at you 's . Pop , you 've been alone since Mamma died . Padrino you 've been alone all my life . Is that what you want for me , to grow old like you ? With nothing but bodyguards and money to keep me company ? Charley , my beloved man . You will be even more alone . If you turn you back on us , we are your blood . Jees , I feel like I 'm drowning or something . We covered up the Vegas scam to protect her . That 's what I thought we did for our women . How can that be a sin against honour ? She is a hitter and a thief . You must give her to us . What is your answer ? The family . It 's the only place I can be , I know that . It 's business Charley , only business . Irene ? Charley . Hello . Everything is ok . The Don 's gon na
zone1	I got it right here . The Don 's giving money back ? Since when ? Yeah you could have knocked me over . That ai n't all . He 's gon na pay you every dime for Filargi 's stand ... and what Dominic set . How about that ? Oh , Charley ! Well ... I 'm glad everything is settled . I just ... wanted you to know that everything is a hundred percent ok . Oh Marxie , I should have listened . After you take this stone out of my shoe ... you call your father ... and tell him where he can get her . And then the wind will stop blowing . Charley ... you got 900,000 here . What 's the first flight out of L.A . To Hong Kong in the morning ? Flight 009 at 10.45 am . But we can get you to Hong Kong tonight out of LA . Oh no thank you I have to go to the bank in the morning . Reserve 009 then one seat , first class . The name is Hilary Jackson
zone1	Irene ? Irene ? Look who 's here . Charley ! What a wonderful surprise ! Baby I got three whole days . We can do anything you want . You name it . Baby we are gon na have a ball . Jesus , what a beautiful song . Why do n't you go and warm up the bed ? I 'll be right there . Yeah ! Mae ? Charley . Charley , you know what ? My sister Theresa just got back today from her honeymoon . Where did they go ? Outer space ? What do you say ... we go to dinner tonight ? Dinner ? What do you mean ? What do I mean ? I mean let 's go some place and get something to eat . You , me and Irene ? No . Just you and me . What about Irene ? She had to go away . She wo n't be back . How about it ? How about ? Holy cow , Charley . Just tell me where you want to meet .

Look , what I want you to do is line her onto the main line on track one . - OK . - Got it ? I 'll take things over from there . Right , Frank . Shit ! - This sucker is flyin ' , Manny . - Should 've hooked it to those freight cars . Smile , man . We 're free . Yeah . - You think so , huh ? - Yeah . Hey , Manny . I want you to know I 'm proud to be your deputy , partner . Look , kid , I appreciate what you done , but you ai n't no kind of partner to me . Do n't be proud of yourself . Look at them tattoos . They 'll look really nice in a swimming pool in Acapulco . What 'd I do to deserve this shit from you ? You do n't know nothin '
zone1	at war with the world and everybody in it . And you 're gon na get hurt . - I do n't get you , man . - Rape boys usually are dumb . Rapo ? ! I ai n't no goddamn rapo , man ! Where 'd you get that from ? It 's on your rap sheet . Busted for rape two years ago . Shit , man ! That was just statutory rape . She was 15 and I was older than her . That 's good . Whoo ! - What 's wrong ? You dying ' for company ? - You think somebody 'll be watchin ' ? I expect nothin ' . She 's gaining speed fast . She 'll hit your territory soon . Her brakes are burning up . Are you nuts ? Her brakes have burnt off . How in the fuck did that happen ? Did n't they check it ? - The throttle must be jammed wide open . - Oh , damn ! - There she goes . - Oh , God , man . What are we
zone1	kids . I ai n't got no money like Michael Jackson . - Come on , the system 's foolproof . - Why ? Because you designed it ? That I did , my boy , and I know how to use it . Now , let me show you . We 'd better fly over the highway . Are you serious ? Jesus , those scum could never make it this far out . - We 're freezing our asses off for nothing . - Shut up . Keep your eyes on the glacier . This guy . I 'm telling you . He 'd do the same thing I would do . Hey , I just thought about that bank that you ripped off in Reno . Whoo-ee ! I was in reform school . Man , that was so fucking great . Two million simoleons . Man , that was hot . Two million is a slight exaggeration . The insurance company . Standard procedure . Yeah , but it was still fucking great , man . I 'll tell you what . Hey , Manny ,

And I 'm gon na party , ooh ! Yeah . Shit . I 'm gon na go to Mardi Gras , I 'm gon na go to Vegas , and I 'm gon na go with enough money in my hip pocket to catch some fine bitches . You know , I spend almost every night of my life dreaming ' about this kind of shit . - Dreamin ' ? - Yeah . Dreamin ' . That 's bullshit . You 're not gon na do nothin ' like that . I 'll tell you what you 're gon na do . You 're gon na get a job . That 's what you 're gon na do - a little job . Some job a convict can get , like sweeping off trays in a cafeteria or cleaning toilets . And you 're gon na
zone1	is gold . Let me tell you , Jack , that is gold . You listenin ' to me ? And when that man walks in at the end of the day and he comes to see how you done , you ai n't gon na look in his eyes . You 'll look at the floor because you do n't wan na see that fear in his eyes when you grab his face and slam him to the floor and make him cry for his life . So you look right at the floor . Pay attention to what I 'm sayin ' , motherfucker . And then he 's gon na see how you done . He 's gon na say " You missed a little spot over there . " " You did n't get this one here . What about this little-bitty spot ? " And you 're gon na suck all that pain inside you and you 're gon na clean that spot . And you 're gon na clean that spot until you get that shiny clean . And on Friday you 'll pick
zone1	, you could be president of Chase Manhattan Corporations . If you could do that . Not me , man . I would n't do that kind of shit . I 'd rather be in fuckin ' jail . More 's the pity , youngster . More 's the pity . Could you do that kind of shit ? I wish I could . I wish I could . Central . Central . Eastbound 12 . Eastbound 12 . - Barstow here . - Why did you stop us ? There 's a runaway coming at you on track one . Hear me ? - Number 12 , answer me ! - I do n't see any runaway . If you were close enough to see her , you 'd be dead . Get it ? She 's four miles away . I want you to pull onto track two at once . Repeat , at once ! My God . No , are you serious ? Hey , Ruby , what 's going on ? - Hey , hey , you ca n't go in there right now .
zone1	crawling . Who 's the incompetent bastard on her ? Ask him to clear fast ! Oh , man . Oh , man . Oh , man . Did n't I tell you ? I told you something was fucked up . - Maybe we 're on some express run . - Wake up . We blew that caboose to hell . Something screwy is goin ' on here . Look . Look . All the handrails are gone . - Maybe the engineer is croaked . - Engineers do not just croak . Why do n't the whistle ever blow , huh ? What are you , out of your mind ? I just wanted to see if it worked . You said the engineer was croak ... Let go . - You think it 's a cops-and-robbers game . - Hey , man . You picked the train . - You 're right . - Yeah . State police calling chopper one . State police calling chopper one . Come in . - We have information on the escapees . - Ranken , that 's your radio .
zone1	. Looks like prison brogans . - How 'd they get so far ? - What did I tell you ? Tell them I 'll be there in ten minutes . Have some officers ready . Roger , state police . We 're on our way . Let 's have some fun . Maybe we just ought a clear out of here . Maybe we just ought a jump for it . What do you say ? We can break our necks anytime we want . Yeah . That makes sense . - Let 's find out what 's happening . - How we gon na do that ? - Go up front and find out . - Yeah . Find out what 's happening . Go up front and find out what the hell is goin ' on . I want that , man . - What ? - Tuck that in on you someplace . All right . And wait till I give you the office before you attack . Yeah . Yeah . OK . Hello , Mr MacDonald . Do n't tell anyone about the runaway
zone1	Besides , we 've got the company 's reputation to uphold . What 's the latest ? It went straight through the caboose of Granville 12 . Well , anyone hurt ? - No . What 's the story on the engineer ? - He had a heart attack - old fart . He made everyone bananas tryin ' to keep that engine from goin ' to scrap . Get that . - What 's the speed ? - About 70 . Hey , Barstow , why do n't you stop her ? You put the system in . Cost the company $4.5 million . The system is designed to dispatch trains , not to stop them when they 're unmanned . The brakes are out , the overspeed control must 've gotten screwed up by the crash . But do n't worry , Eddie . We 'll do all we can to avoid more casualties . - Do n't forget about the Seneca bridge . - Dave , get us some coffee . - What about the bridge ? - I 'm taking care of it . - I
zone1	. - So what ? Are you gon na get the coffee ? Mr MacDonald , by the time that runaway reaches this bridge , it 'll be doin ' 90 . The restriction for that bridge is 50 . - Get her on the spur in Jordan . Derail her . - Best idea , sir . I do n't need you to tell me if I 'm right ! Derail her ! I do n't wan na lose the bridge ! This system is designed so I can get everyone onto the siding . - Meanwhile , we 'll think of something else . - Right now it 's four engines , no people . If I let you jerk off with your system , this wild animal 's gon na kill somebody . You know what that 'll cost the company ? Do you ? ! Derail her . That 's my order . You say derail , then we derail . But these people are witnesses . It 's your decision , Eddie . Yeah . Yeah , it 's my decision . Central calling Jordan
zone1	is an emergency . Signal maintainer 40 , acknowledge . This is an emergency . Central calling Jordan . Signal maintainer 40 , come in . Where the hell are you ? Central calling Jordan . Jordan . Signal maintainer 40 here . Central here . There is an unmanned runaway heading west on track one . Line her into the siding . Use the manual switch , then get out of the way . Superintendent MacDonald wants to derail her . Got that ? Mr Eddie MacDonald . I 'll be goddamned . Son of a bitch . Oh ! Hey , you hear that ? Come on , Manny . Come on , Manny . See ? See , I told you , man . I told you . I knew we had an engineer on this sucker . - You were right , kid . - I say blow , baby , blow ! Boy , this is gon na be somethin ' . Huh ? - Signal maintainer 40 here at Jordan . - Central . Listen , did I hear you right that that runaway
zone1	's right . - Let me tell you somethin ' , mister . I think you 're wrong . The whistle ! The goddamn whistle 's blowing ! Derailing is out . Run , old man , run ! Line her through ! Somebody 's blowing the whistle . You 'd have killed him just like that . My God ! OK , next hurdle . Come on , big train . I 'll slap your fat diesel ass . Come on ! D' you like ' em - anchovies ? I do n't remember havin ' any . Well , if you had ' em , you 'd remember having ' em , man . I tell you what . - Get over here . - Yeah . What ? - I do n't think he saw us . - OK . OK . What do we do now ? Let him come . When he gets two-thirds through that door , we 'll nail him . Uh ... - We ai n't gon na kill him , are we ? - No . OK . Unless we have
zone1	on . Yeah . Yeah , that makes sense . Oh , man . He 's in trouble out there . Let 's help him . Come on . Let 's go help him , Manny . Down ! Oh , man . What are you doin ' here ? What am I doing here ? I work on this train . - What are you doing here ? - What are we doin ' here ? I 'll tell you what we 're doin ' here . We 're on our way to Las Vegas to see our close and personal friend , Wayne Newton . Why ? Are you collecting tickets or somethin ' , sweetheart ? Hey , sweetheart , how would you like a really good fuck , huh ? Just try it . Just try it ! Freeze on that bullshit . What happened to you ? I was tired . I was taking a nap . I should n't have done it , but I did it . So what ? My head got hit when we slammed into that caboose . I do
zone1	on this train . Nobody but us . - She 's lyin ' . We heard the whistle . - I blew the whistle ! You 're tryin ' to get us busted . This runaway 's gon na run into something fast . I climbed back here to the last engine where it 's safer . Do n't you get it ? - I do n't believe her bullshit . - You do n't believe me ? You just look out the window , you do n't believe me . This train is out of control . My God , we can get killed . Then we 'd better do somethin ' about it . What about the hostler helper ? A woman . Goddammit . Does she know anything about running a locomotive ? Shit ! The only person on the whole train is a woman . How lucky can I get ? - Now what ? - The chief of security from Stonehaven . - I do n't have time for him . - He says it 's important . - He know about the runaway ?
zone1	him we 'll see him later . - How far to the bridge ? What 's the ETA ? - 25 minutes . Shit . - Seneca station . - Go ahead . MacDonald from Central . A runaway 's coming your way . Going over 80 . - That 's too fast for the bridge . - I know it 's going too fast . - Have your emergency crew together . - Christ ! Ca n't you stop it ? We 're gon na stop it . Have ' em there just in case . Asshole . It wo n't do a thing . Agh ! - I already tried it from the second engine . - Why not ? All I know is when a bunch of engines are hooked up together everything operates from the lead engine - you stop the lead engine , all of ' em stop . I do n't believe this shit ! We get out of a maximum security prison and wind up on an unmanned train with this bitch and bad news . - You guys bust out of Stonehaven
zone1	'd you tell her that ? You told her , clown . - So what ? She gon na drop a dime on us ? - No . Boy , I guess you guys picked the wrong train . How come you did n't go up to the lead engine ? How come you come back here ? You ca n't cross from the second to the first engine . It does n't have a walkway . There 's a door in front , but it must 've jammed in the collision . Oh , man . What do we do now ' ? - You think they know about us ? - They do now , after we hit that caboose . If they woke up , there 'd be pigs all over this thing whenever and wherever it stops . - Ranken 's all over this territory . - Yeah . Maybe he 'll find us . I ai n't giving ' up . No matter who dies , I ai n't giving ' him that pleasure . No fuckin ' way . I do n't wan na
zone1	alive . And you neither . I do n't know , man . I do n't know nothin ' right now . I ca n't even think straight right now . Just do what I tell you and do n't crap on yourself . I let you tag along to be a regular , not a piece of shit . What you 're doin ' ai n't nothin ' , man . We do n't stand a chance if we jump out . I ca n't jump here . This is suicide . If you jump here , you 're gon na break every bone in your body . Then what ? - They 've been broke before . - I 'm with you , Manny . I 'm with you till the wheels come off . - You ca n't go ! - No ? - You ca n't leave me alone here . - I do n't care who jumps with me . I know how to stop the train ! - Why did n't you tell us that to start with ? - We probably ca n't
zone1	it down . - You tell me how . If we can disconnect the electric cables between the engines , the engines 'll shut down one at a time . Now , it 's not gon na be easy . We ... They 'll be frozen and we do n't have the right tools , but it 's a better chance than jumping out . You better know what you 're talkin ' about . Do n't threaten me . What 's the matter with you ? Come on , let 's go . That one . - The one next to the coupling ? - Yeah . Here . Take me up . You do it . You have two hands . - OK . Hold on to me . - Use the wrench . Hey , I did it ! I got it ! Get me up . Get me up . I got it ! - Frank , look at this . Come look at this . - Look at what ? The runaway has slowed down . - See ? It 's at 80 , and
zone1	minutes ago . - I do n't understand it . - The girl . She slowed it . It does n't matter . 80 , 180 . The bridge wo n't take the train goin ' that fast . - How far to the bridge now ? - Five minutes . - Let 's go . - Right . - We can use the fire extinguisher . - Right . Right . I lost it ! She 's coming ! ETA 's in about three minutes ! Get me up . Manny ! Manny ! Get her , man . Get her ! I got you . Hold my hand . Hold my hand ! Grab my hand ! Come on . Look ! Look ! Manny ! Look , Manny ! Look ! Get me Central , quick . Oh , man . Oh , man . That 's crazy . There are three people on the runaway . Holy shit . Where 'd they come from ? How do I know ? We saved three lives . - Not for long . - Dave , will you give
zone1	but we 've got five minutes to get the runaway off the main line , or there 'll be a head-on with the Northeast Express . It 's no big deal . We 'll just head her into the 14 . Great idea , Frank . Why do n't you just send her to Elken 's ? - So ? - No , no , no . That 's the chemical plant . - She wo n't make the curve at that speed . - She 'll flip and wipe out the whole plant . We 'd better warn ' em . You know , girl , I ought a thank you . I mean , it 's one thing to jump and wrap yourself around a tree or a pole . But to wind up spilt all over a ditch with a broken hip waiting ' for the bulls , what a waste . Yeah , man . You ai n't kiddin ' . Hey , look . We 're almost there . Come on , Manny . Let 's rip this fucker . - Is that the door
zone1	it . Hey , do n't you worry , sweetheart . We 've been breakin ' through doors all our lives . Come on , man . You ca n't do it with that hand of yours . Let me help . - Let me in there . - I got it ! You ca n't do it with that hand of yours . Shit . Shit . Bullshit . Take the first west at Macketsburg . Get onto the Bellport siding . Get the emergency crew in and evacuatel the plant . Get ' em as far away as possible . You got ten minutes , if you 're lucky . Get off my back , woman ! Mr Barstow , I have two very dangerous prisoners on the loose . I do n't give a shit if your whole prison 's loose . I got a killer train on my hands with three people on board , and no free tracks left . So do me a fucking favour and get lost , or I 'll have your ass kicked out ! On the double ! You keep
zone1	take a leak . I hope you do n't like it and want to do something about it . Yeah , I did n't think you wanted to back up that loud conversation . Wipe that piss off your face . I do n't wan na hear any more crap out of you . If I do n't get my convicts back , the prison will be out of control . You know what a riot in a maximum security prison looks like ? Your brains are too small to imagine it . - Now , where 's the train ? - Track one . I 'm gon na kick your teeth in . You 're playing with me . Tell me straight . Got it ? - Tell me how to find it with a helicopter . - Yeah , yeah , yeah . I 'll show you . I 'll be goddamned if I 've come all this way to get stuck by some goddamn door ! Shit ! Do n't give up now . We 're gon na make it through this . How ? - I
zone1	the people are clearing the tracks , and I know that they wo n't abandon us . - How do you know that ? - I just feel it in my heart . There are miracles . You 're stupid . You know how stupid you sound ? Miracle , my ass . One must count on oneself . Nobody else . You think I 'm waitin ' around for a miracle to happen ? I ai n't waiting ' for no miracle . I 'm goin ' out and around . Out and around . I 'm goin ' there . That 's where I 'm goin ' . You ca n't make it . There 's nothing to hold on to out there . There 's no walkways . I told you , you ca n't make it . I 'll make it . If I have to fly the five feet , like a birdie , I 'll fly it . I 'll make it . Hey , Manny , you ca n't do it , not with that arm of yours . But I can do

If I wanted to punch your ticket , you 'd be long gone . You can do it . I 'm tellin ' you you can do it . I ca n't

You hear me ? - Stop it ! Get the fuck up . No ! No ! Get the fuck outta here ! - OK . - No . - OK . - No . No . OK . OK . OK . I 'm goin ' . No . No , he 's using you . He 's using you . Do n't go ! - You gon na do what I tell you ? - Yeah . - You 're gon na do it . - Do it yourself , if you 're so brave . - I would if I had two hands . - Bullshit !

You know , you 're worse than Ranken , when the truth comes out . At least he 's upfront with his bullshit . You was a hero . You was a hero to all of us back
zone1	Manny ... It 's your mess , Frank . You should 've listened to me and derailed her . What do we do ? Shunt ' em onto the siding and in 15 minutes they run out of track ? - Elken station . Elken station ! - Elken . Go ahead . - Gilchrist , this is MacDonald . - Yes , MacDonald . - Barstow here . - Come on . Now listen carefully and act fast . You have about one minute to line the runaway under the old spur . - You got it . - Good , good , good . Good boy . We 'll save the chemical plant , huh ? We 're still gon na lose those three people . There are still a lot of beaming faces at NASA headquarters in Houston today over Wednesday 's success launch of the two new communications satellites . The number of sophisticated experiments will apparently be doubled on next month 's launch of an Anglo-French weather satellite . Launch director Hogan praised the crew of the just-completed mission ... I still do n't understand

Listen , if you want any of the furniture , it 's all for sale . Well , I think that we 'd like to decorate it ourselves . I 'd sell it cheap . I need all the money I can get .

I 'm not crazy about the idea of you sleeping with him , but if ... you did it and did n't tell me ... that would really bother me . Without changing my plea , I would like to know why . Because it underestimates me . Not telling me assumes I 'm incapable ... of understanding why you did it . Not that you did it . Had you done it . Did you ? You want me to tell you the truth , no matter how much it hurts . If we ca n't be honest with each other , what else have we got ? And you 'll believe in me ? You 'll

You 've taken a woman who loves you ... one of the great women on the face of this Earth ... and thrown her away .

zone1	5542280 [Int] . You are familiar with the term , " The Rat Line " I know it is a miss-nomal . But you 've heard the term ? I assume that you do n't believe it was a line for rats . Not at all used ... formeroperatorofthe " RatLine " It was invention of the guys " post factum . " Have you not agreed with that description of it . It is outrageous ... it is offensive ... Well , explain why . Well it is derogatory . Father Draganovic has supplied the documents for Barbie ? Yes , he was chief organizer of the enterprise . And the Americans came to him to Rome ... to ask him to do services of sending out of Europe people who are American Intelligence services . How did they approach him ? Oh it was simple , he was public person ... living in the Croatian seminary in Rome , for priests . And therefore American services from Salzburg ... CIC ... could contact him through different intermediaries in Rome . Draganovic was the main outside organizer ... and the one who procured all documents and bank affairs ...
zone1	protection He was a priest ... and priest robes always protect somebody like in New York ! Pope Pius 1 was very much upset by Europe 's folly to the communism and was eager to help everybody who needed help . The Secretary of State was Giovanni Montini , the future Pope Paul VI . He would defend people , with his recommendation for help . Did this include SS ? I never personally ever asked anybody anything . Whoever came ... like in the most famous Catholic tradition ... " No questions asked " . **26;7038;TOOLONG You do n't have a Rat Line only created for Klaus Barbie ... It would be too expensive ... and it would n't have such a name . It 's hard for me to believe that Barbie was an isolated incident . There is that segment of the Jews who would never stop before turning the last stone . And therefore such Jews , helped by immense riches in this country , want to prosecute Barbie . You think that they 're vengeful people ? Oh yes . The revenge for what ?
zone1	having committed those crimes ... and hang . I see . Do you ever get the feeling , Holtzman , that only Jews and old Nazis are still interested in Jews and old Nazis ? Actually not ... actually the whole problem with Nazi war criminals , for example ... was brought to my attention by a non-Jew ... who was horrified , as a human being that our government could protect Nazi war criminals living here ... and allow them to stay here . Among them is the former congressman Holtz who started it , and now that she wants to run once more , and in Brooklyn are those Jews who want to prosecute , persecute , Nazis , collaborators , and everything what comes under that roof , to the last end . Until the last blood of them is not ... is gone . There 's a view that somehow the holocaust is simply a Jewish problem . The dangers of the holocaust were for millions of no-Jews as well . And the threat that it represents to the world today ... is to all humanity
zone1	to the use of someone like Klaus Barbie ... suggests that it could have been much more widespread . And indeed , if US government officials were willing to bring Nazi murderers to our very shores , there 's no reason to think they would n't have worked with them abroad . From that moment , Americans had nothing to do but to pay . And therefore so much for documents and transportation ... and whatever money ... Did you supply the documents ? Yes ... In Augsburg , CIC Augsburg knew what CIC in Salzburg was doing ... Neagoy went to Salzburg ... Americans like to travel . And there 's a nice overnight in Salzburg or Munich . All on expense account . An expense account ... there is never enough ! And Neagoy told them " I bring you in . " And Altman travelled , and Draganovic would make him whatever you know . And George Neagoy ... you knew him ? Oh yes , we were good friends . He came with the American Intelligence , and ... was eager to hear what happened to
zone1	are needed ... **30;7066;TOOLONG No ... no ... no pictures ! ... So sorry . Chris ... did you explain that we were making a film ? I thought that I had mentioned that , yes . Interview yes ... but no pictures . I 'm not involved any more ... but the Barbie thing , that 's ? My conclusion was that the CIA was not directly involved . Now what does that mean ? It means that one particular part of our bureaucracy was not involved ... and another was . I met at least 3 different American intelligence services ... **29;7098;TOOLONG [Spanish] I think Barbie was recruited by the CIA . before he left Europe for South America . Everything suggests he was working for the CIA . He received protection from the US security . To travel freely in Europe , the US , Spain , you needed the kind of protection Barbie had , as he was a man sought internationally for his crimes . [businessman] We saw in Barbie/Altman a [German] who had done his duty for his country . In this case ,
zone1	we would have done our duty too . [French] At the Interior Ministry where I waited hours ... for interrogation . I sat in an armchair in the office of the chief of intelligence . I saw a man in a coat enter ... not tall ... Short ... with a little hat ... [Int] . A round one . Yes , and he had blue eyes . But he was unusual in contrast to the others . He came in and spoke with this gentleman ... Then left through another door . The previous governments really did n't want to arrest him . [Interpreter_Spanish] They did n't want to arrest Barbie . He headed efforts to organize repressive forces in this country . [French] Were you tortured ? Interrogated ... decently decently at first ... then very roughly ... and after ... very , very roughly . [Int] . For long ? For days ? Yes . And months later , they came back for ... Information ? Yes , I spent 1 ? years in prison . But the rough questioning lasted about 8 months . It was
zone1	" Furmont " was organized . It was Barrientos ' private paramilitary squad , organized for political repression . Then came General Be nzer , with whom Barbie collaborated even more openly . They carried out arrests , interrogations , murders . [French] It was under General Benzer , in March 1972 . [Int] . - Why ? - I 'm a journalist . We wrote about abuses under the Benzer regime . - Human rights ? - Yes , mostly . I knew some of those who disappeared . I could have witnessed their deaths , because I was in a prison cell right next to their friends . Sent to their deaths ? Later I saw him in the street with the Mr De Castro . I thought ... " I know him ! " . It was years ago . [Int] . You 'd seen him at the ministry ? - In the place of torture . - Yes . [bodyguard] The gentleman we 've been talking about must be in the next room . [Spanish] The highway must have been very bad , no ? -
zone1	Santana ? - Oh , sure . This is the photo I got of de Castro with Barbie in the street . Whenever you saw Barbie in the street , Alvaro was with him . Alvaro de Castro ... plaintiff for many of Barbie 's activities . AssociatedPress , LaPaz You two have deals then , I guess . No , because he was arrested a few months ago , was held for several weeks and interrogated ... his pictures flashed all over the world as a paramilitary Neo-Nazi and Barbie 's friend ... so he 's very upset about it . But does he give , or know you ? Yeah ... for a fee . A lot of them ? I think he 's made some good money off Barbie . [Spanish] Later , I 'll need a card from you . Sure ... we can work that out . In his possession they found a whole bunch of photographs ... Nazi paraphernalia , literature , Mussolini posters , Hitler posters , and so on ... Are you sure that the Nazi paraphernalia was n't planted by the
zone1	in the paraphernalia of Alvaro de Castro doing " Heil Hitler " . And that was n't planted . I think it 'd be interesting to ask him about the arms dealing . I 'm certain Alvaro De Castro was the representative from this Austrian company . And there are also reports of people seeing De Castro doing torture sessions here in La Paz . [Spanish] It is now 2.14 ... 3.40 ... 2.46 . His Austrian firm was dealing with the drug king ... what 's his name , Don ... Roberto Su ? rez ... the cocaine kingpin . He 's in hiding somewhere here . Oh yes ... the law is after him . And he uses Steyr weapons . [Spanish] Well , the time is here In Bolivia , there is no " official " time . Nothing 's official . De Castro must be getting impatient in there . Well , his demeanour is charming , he looks like a gentleman . He 's really not going to reveal anything that 's sensational ... or anything that 's critical of Barbie or himself . [De_Castro]
zone1	do n't you ? I 'm sorry I 'm late ... I 'm sorry I 'm this way ... I 'm having the altitude sickness . So I 'm taking afternoon naps . Alvaro De Castro , have you had any communication with your friend Klaus Barbie ... since he 's been jailed in Lyon ? [Spanish] Yes , I had news from him . Almost since the week he got to France ... I get one about every 8 or 9 days . Is he in good health ? [De_Castro] I doubt it 's fun being in jail . Someone tells me that Dom Roberto Su ? rez , the drug king in Bolivia ... receives arms from an Austrian firm . And you are the representative in Bolivia of that Austrian firm . Could you tell me if that information is correct ? [Spanish] Very well . There 's been a lot of talk in this country that Altman and I and the Austrian firm were involved in supplying arms to this man . Is it just talk ? Is it not true ? It 's not true
zone1	is ... Please ... do you work for them or do n't you ? - The true situation ... - Answer my question . Do you or do n't you ... Have you worked for them ? Well I work for ... worked for ... but not now . [Int] . Now give me an explanation . Of course in principle , I have to say first ... Barbie was never involved in the drug trade ... or in drug traffic ... no . And I think they were also involved in providing information ... intelligence information to the US government . Did you ever go to the American embassy with information ? No , never . I have friends ... I have had friends . Think it over ... because I 'll be going to the American embassy . I had friends many years ago ... but information ? No . I took part in their social events , sports ... But I never took information there . never . formerchieftainof " TheFianc ? sofDeath " [German] I first met Barbie in La Paz That is , after knowing
zone1	the photo ... The famous photo of the coup of July 17 , 1980 . The fact that I hired , or Barbie hired , Ustarez as his lawyer ... does n't mean they 're friends for life . That 's absurd . - This a group of paramilitary ... - Are they the " Fianc ? s of Death " ? The " Fianc ? s of Death " ... This is Joachim Fiebelkorn ... this is an ex-Nazi who 's involved in arms dealing ... and this is Adolfo Ustarez ... the lawyer . And this is a photo of Adolfo Ustarez with Klaus Barbie . Who are the " Fianc ? s of Death " ? I do n't understand . AH ... the " Fianc ? s of Death " ... [German] adventurers who came to Bolivia . [German] In this famous caf� ? in La Paz , sat Dr Ustarez , the lawyer . We joined Barbie at his table . We spoke only [Spanish] , and then Ustarez said ... " He 's a countryman of yours . " So he says to me
zone1	say yes . " From where ? " " From near Frankfurt . " So he asks what I 'm doing in Bolivia . I say " I plan to live here . " I 'll never forget his first words about Bolivia ... A tip about Bolivia ... To stay out of politics and anything to do with drugs . " Then you can live in peace . " His very words . Our first conversation . Advice you did n't always follow . Not at all . In fact I fell into it . Climbed in , you mean . It was through a Bolivian general that I fell into it all . The general knew I 'd been with the police . They knew also that I 'd shipped arms from Germany . That 's when I knew politically that I was on the general 's side . The police were really ... leftists . Leftists who stand for things I oppose . For that I did n't need to emigrate . Marxism , Che Guevara ... you name it . Even police officers trained in Cuba
zone1	could be part of that . [Int] . So you took the other side ? Of course ... it was the only way . [Int] . Which was more Barbie 's side . Yes , Barbie 's side , of course . Dis you ever meet Fiebelkorn ? [Spanish] It 's true ... I met him . Did you have drinks with him ? Did you go out with him ? Nights with him in Santa Cruz ? Not with me . With Barbie ? Just once at the restaurant Bavaria ... just once . [German] As a guest I can say that when he had company ... his wife was more suspicious than he . At his house that was my impression . He mentioned Klarsfeld 's coming , but only casually . But I can tell you , I told my general I said ... " If that man was SS , I was Napoleon 's adjutant ! " All these former Nazis were very closely tied together . Although that Klarsfeld should come in on that himself ... the fact that they were tied . And there
zone1	was in my opinion , very , very active . [Spanish] In Argentina , the Eichmann issue had come up . At least I think they 'd already discovered him ... and he , Eichmann , of course felt cornered . Eichmann who had contacts and friends eager to help him . Barbie somehow heard they wanted to help Eichmann move to Santa Cruz . [German] The old crowd kept up contact , I wo n't deny it . General Wolf ... [Int] . Visited Barbie ? Yes , he came . They met . I do n't know what was discussed though . He was at least 80 . So the altitude was a problem . Did Barbie ever talk with you about the Mengele case ? Yes , of course . We had long talks about his work at Buenos Aires University , and his professorship . Did you think Mengele was a criminal ? Well that was n't it exactly , no . He explained it to me ... how these were well-orchestrated exaggerations ... cleverly manipulated for the world press , to present Mengele as a
zone1	... and Barbie 's role . I 'm told we 've also exaggerated Eichmann 's role . So who 's role did we NOT exaggerate ? Personally , I ca n't say ... I was n't there . I do know from reading history , WWll accounts ... many distortions arise between writers . Do you know any Jews ? It 's possible . Do you know how to recognize a Jew ? Has Barbie taught you how to recognize a Jew ? No , not him exactly , but ... [Int] . Barbie did n't like Jews , did he ? Let 's face it . I would n't say that . He did have Jewish friends here . He said , that among these people , among these Jews , there were some who were n't full of anger . Not vindictive or not full of anger ? So he said . [German] 2 weeks after the coup of the 17th , the revolution of Garcia Meza , I was assigned to security at Santa Cruz airport , which I 'd blocked off with my paramilitary . Everything
zone1	in the departure lounge with the Bolivian lieutenant . Suddenly there 's an uproar on level 3 . So I look up to see what was wrong , and there 's Barbie . I had no idea he was there Barbie , on level 3 ... I knew it was him , and I see a much taller man trying to push him over the railing . This [German] Jew says , " I 'll kill you , Nazi swine ! " " In ' 36 you put me in a concentration camp . You murdered my family and my friends . " or some such thing . It was getting dangerous . Barbie was half over the railing , just about ready to fall . In my own country , very often I ca n't even walk down the streets . Well , they insult me ... I ca n't go into a store to buy a sweater or a shirt ... And I have to ask a friend to go buy shoes for me . I ca n't go in myself . They might insult me , and
zone1	know you 're known as Barbie 's best friend ? Sure they know , that 's why they insult me . Peter , [Spanish] Are you even sorry to be Barbie 's friend ? No , why should I be ? I 'm not sorry . **37;7129;TOOLONG ... In so far as America having Lima in Chile , Ecuador , Argentina as the recipients of the ... how would you say it ? The " Strandgutes Krieges " ... all kind of " Strandgut " of the war . In [German] it is a very nice word to say ... " leftovers " [jetsam] . What 's left on the beach ... the vanquished . Then of course , in these circles , a lot of sentiment and understanding was there . - Resentment toward the ... - Having lost ! - And therefore they sat around and drank ... - Drank their beer and sang their old songs . And how about Barbie ? Barbie said nothing about what he did in the war . I met him at the house of a friend , in Santa Clara near
zone1	' 69 or ' 70 . I ca n't recall it very well . But at that time he was not prominent in Lima yet . Translator , [Spanish] Do you know the name " Barbie " ? Yes , he was a noble man , truly . He was in the army . He thinks he was an army man . And also he thinks of army man as nobleman . As noble man ? One day there was a guest from Bolivia a merchant ... Klaus Altmann-Handen ... Who was presented to me ... and his wife . They called her Jin ... Jin Altmann . That 's how I met them . He was director of Transmarica Boliviana which is a privately owned , with state participation , shipping company of Bolivia . Then he bought a house next to my place Which is a further 20 kilometres up towards the Andes . As I live 75 k outside , I do not go home for siestas . I normally finished work at the Chamber of Commerce at about 7pm . And on the way home ,
zone1	I found him quite interesting . There was always something interesting to talk about . What type of thing ? Well ... it 'd be about Schwend , you know , ... Not about Barbie . In this I would not say that Barbie was the reason I dropped in ... I did n't find him THAT interesting . He talked about his exploits in the war ... One time he showed me his medals . He got the Iron Cross first class , second class ... and he got ... He had a small ribbon and very proud of it ... the swastika was still in it . Now you can wear the old medals again without the swastika . He of course never would wear them without the swastika . That is of course against his " honor " ! formerfederaljudge , Lima This property was managed by Fritz Paul Schwend . Living there temporarily was Klaus Altmann Barbie , who had just come to Peru from Bolivia . On the other side lived Schneider-Merck , then president of the Peruvian-German Chamber of Commerce . - You spoke
zone1	course . I would n't ... why should we ? ... we 're all Germans ! Trans . [Spanish] Does Schneider-Merck live here ? Yes . - In what house ? - The second one . I 'm not done yet , but I do n't know where they are . So I got into currency dealings with these people ... And they really cheated me ... after this apparent friendship ... It became absolutely ... I was just conned . In a very very vile way by these 2 buggers . Barbie as a " crook " ... among other things ? ! Oh , definitely ... he 's not only crooked in mind ... he is a crook . I would definitely say so ... the criminal energy required to torture another human being . Probably someone who is capable of this , is capable of doing anything else ... And still having a clean conscience . The only scruples that Barbie had , was that he had to somehow bring together for example his avowed Nazi ideology , which of course required a lot of idealism ,
zone1	up personal freedom for the " bigger idea " ... Yes he had to bring that together . With what ? Bring together the Nazi ideology with what ? With his own dealings . [Spanish] It can be proved it is through Klaus Altman or Klaus Barbie that the Banco Popular Del Peru had an office in Bolivia . Dollars , converted to soles , were sent to Bolivia , then converted back to dollars then sent by Klaus Altmann through an international network to foreign accounts . And they stole this considerable sum of money ... 500,000 Deutschmarks in cash ... was in 1971 quite a lot of money . They really stole from me . They did n't have to go into my house ... I gave it to them ! To deposit it in Bolivia . [Spanish] Fritz Paul Schwend worked with our intelligence service , through which he tried to get information about possible dollar accounts abroad . Then he made contacts in Hamburg in Germany , looking for people to put the squeeze on . - I was a victim of ... - But you
zone1	in currency dealings . [Spanish] He liked us . He was a good noble person . He said Altmann was a nice person . He liked him a lot . How did he feel about South American indians ? You talked with him for 2 years ... you must have talked a lot about that . It 's a little bit difficult ... There was this very jolly admiral ... I really do not recall his name but he was a typical cholo ... a highlander ... massively strong ... short cropped black hair . But really looking like an indian ... and We went to the harbor because he wanted to buy a second-hand ship ... and I noticed he was treated as admiral like a subordinate . Like " Carry my bag " ... you know . Mr Altmann praised his work , when he was doing his gardening . [Spanish] Did Mr Altmann like flowers ? He had a feeling of superiority ... he was absolutely sure of himself . - Supermensch ? - Oh , definitely . **35;7168;TOOLONG When they launched the Transmaratima Bolivian Barrientos said
zone1	. " " A naval engineer who 'll be working with us . " That 's when we became friends , and he became our manager . They used of course this Transmaratima for all kinds of deals . General Barrientos knew Barbie was a scoundrel when he put him in charge . He 'd been given a Bolivian diplomatic passport , which he used for trips to Paris , Berlin , Hamburg , Antwerp , where he went to the best restaurants , the best hotels ' as manager of Transmaratima . They were so enthusiastic ! They asked the Bolivians , children , old people for a national subscription , to invest , so the company could buy a boat . What did they do with that boat ? The Transmaratima . Arms smuggling ? Oh yes ... definitely . I 'm so bad with figures , I ca n't say how much , how many dollars . But it was a lot , because youngsters , even kids , invested their money , so our nation would have access to the sea ! After I found out
zone1	a hotel room in Bogota and thought " What can I do ? " I mean what can I do ... what do I have in hand ? Having known these people for 3 years and having met a lot of their acquaintances ... I was very well aware as to what a feeble and delicate situation I found myself . How powerful and how dangerous they could be , if they found someone not to their liking any longer . He was given protection , since he was " in " with the police . A very frequent visitor was Colonel Velasquez Alavarez ... he was the brother of the military dictator of Bolivia at that time . So you were in that hotel room in Bolivia . Yes , so I thought what can I do against them ? I had handed over a suitcase with the equivalent of 500,000 DM in local currency . And a kilo of gold and some documents ... How could I ever establish it ? There was nothing ... no receipt , nothing . So I started to write down everything I
zone1	[French] and he had even said he was stationed in France . He also said he was stationed for a very short time in Yugoslavia . But he never really said to which battalion , which infantry division he belonged . Perhaps there is some other angle to it . Perhaps something that Altmann is hiding . And I made a very solemn memorandum and I sent this by a friend in Switzerland ... Dr Alfred Jenni from the Santos corporation . I said send it to Simon Wiesenthal . [researcher_of_Nazi_crimes] Schneider-Merck claims to have sent a letter to Simon Wiesenthal . That 's possible , but he did n't send us any letters . And then the answer came back that Simon Wiesenthal declares that he has the whole archives of all members of the Gestapo , SS , SD ... And there is no Klaus Altmann-Handen . [French] Wiesenthal wrote the previous month : " Barbie 's in the Egyptian army . " If it was received , it was n't read . So I said this is really something ... So I said , " Jesus ,
zone1	Because if you are not there , then you are under another name . In November - December 1971 , Banchero Rossi and a correspondent , Herbert John , Gave us Barbie 's address and alias . And right after , 3 or 4 days later , Banchero Rossi was murdered . As he lived next to Barbie and Schwend , they were suspected of the crime . Herbert John ... Reports started to appear . These reports began appearing in Germany , in 2 magazines ... Der Spiegel and Bild Zeitung . That 's it . They made it sound as though it were a conspiracy involving Nazi figures . The last time I ever saw Barbie ... he stopped me on the road ... and very furiously had a newspaper and he said " We had some commercial difficulties ... " " But here ... see what Wiesenthal says one of my cover names was Martin Lauer . How could he ever have known this ? Explain this to me ! " I understand we had some commercial difficulty ... but this is something else " ... Like
zone1	religion . he says people like that is like bad people . " Mr Altmann or Mr Barbie , if you prefer ... " This 500,000 has disappeared ... I want one third back and then I never want to see you again in my life . Only God could judge his worth . God almighty can judge them all . His wife was sitting next to him ... He said " Have we had commercial difficulties ? " " What you did with me was betrayal of a comrade ... " " In my textbook , that is the death penalty , my friend . " In [German] it sounds much more forceful . [German] Your crime , Mr Altmann ... or should I say Barbie ... is betrayal of a comrade By my code of honor , that warrants the death penalty ! And I never saw him again . **37;7205;TOOLONG [French] Around noon I received a wire from Paris ... " We believe that Barbie " " is Altmann and is in Lima . " " We count on you , as ever , to get the

The police were with you ? 4 plainclothes police . I went and talked to Schwend . He chuckled and said " OK . I 'll get you an appointment . " Barbie was there on the dot . After some talk , I said , " Look , people are saying you 're Barbie . " The look on the man 's face was one of total surprise . Then I said , " If that 's untrue ... " We 'll take photos to prove you 're not Barbie . " Here are the photos . [Int] . Shot in Lima ? In a square facing Hotel Bolivar . He 'd have pulled his pants down for sure . [Int] . Such a nice guy could n't be guilty . It was just impossible . But I 'd been instructed To get shots of his ears . [Int] They
zone1	after our talk in the hotel . He posed . After such a demonstration you figure , " This ca n't be Barbie . " [Int] . Because he 's too nice ? Because he 's too nice and too cooperative . So cooperative , that he 'd set up a date in Bolivia . Of course he fled . I asked the [French] government for data . That 's when I met with the [French] ambassador , Mr Chambon . who very cautiously managed not to confirm or deny that Barbie and Altmann were one person . [French] Mr Chambon was in Lima when Beate brought the evidence . He took the right steps , but too late , and he knew it . Barbie was over the border . Naturally he was protected by the authorities . [Spanish] The government , or maybe the minister of the interior , kept me from indicting Altmann . He 'd crossed the border . I decided to have Klaus Barbie arrested , but word leaked out . I was surprised he was in La Paz . [Int] . [French] Why was
zone1	and connections . Around these parts , a friend 's a friend . My first impulse was to report his escape . Then I thought " Do I really want to act like a cop ? " [Int] . Did your attempt to arrest Barbie have a bad influence on your career ? [Spanish] I do n't know whether it helped or hurt . Many bad things have happened to me . I do n't know if they 're due to that , but you noticed I 'm no longer a judge . [Int] . [French] Who decided to let him get away to Bolivia ? It was Richter . [Int] . The minister of the interior . He phoned to say : " Barbie leaves tonight . This makes it official . " " But remember you 're a journalist . " [researcher_of_Nazi_crimes] What we do we do on our own . We 're not paid by any government or party . I ca n't compare myself to Klarsfeld , or those who act with a sense ... of a mission . Their mission is economic ... financially rewarding

You believe the Israeli secret service foots the bill ? Yes , I think so . When I slapped the [German] chancellor , I was called a Soviet agent . When I spoke out against anti-Semitism , I was with the CIA . [Spanish] When the lady arrived , the Nazi-hunter , Miss Karsfeld , we did n't go to tell her Altmann is here ... No way ! But we knew who Altmann was . [French] I did n't see Barbie in La Paz , but I knew he was giving interviews to the press . He said " I 'm proud of all I 've done ... and I 'd do it again for Hitler . " He threatened France . He felt safe under the junta . Up in the Andes , he charged for TV interviews . To our distaste , even [French] TV paid him . [Spanish] He was protected

We said , " Listen , have your shoes shined , and we 'll take your picture . " When we sat him down at a piano in La Paz ... we knew we were really exploiting him . He concentrated like a true pianist ... a real [German] , too ... lyrical . [Spanish] He was a gentleman . He was at ease chatting to a local girl , and he was an intelligent , capable man . [French] Why hound him like that ? He had a family and was trying ... - int . To start over . - To start over . I was n't just thinking of him . His wife suffered terribly . I think it did her in . We did her in . Mrs Halaunbrenner lost her husband and children . She 'd not newsworthy . The media prefers the

All day he was in my home at Villeurbanne . On the Rue Pierre Loti . He took my husband and son from me ... I tried to pull them back ... crying ... but he struck me with his gun butt . [Man] In 1971 , Serge got my name from the phone book . He called and asked if the names Mina and Claudine meant anything to me . [Int] . He called you in 1971 ? It 's then he told me his plan ... " Barbie 's in Bolivia . We can reopen the case . " Mother , who was 68 at the time , agreed to go right away . saying " I 'll do anything to find the one's who killed my husband and kids . They stayed a month in Bolivia . With Beate , they demonstrated against this man , who now at

I was asked to see if Mr Altmann was Mr Barbie . I went as a reporter , not as a Nazi-hunting avenger . [Int] . You were n't the first to identify him . Nor were the Klarsfelds . They deserve the credit for putting Barbie away in a [French] prison . But Barbie had been spotted in South America by the [French] secret service as early as 1966 or ' 67 . [French] diplomats knew of his presence . built in 1967 their major concern was getting Regis [Debray] out of a Bolivian jail . They could n't ask Bolivia for both [Debray] and Barbie . **28;7244;TOOLONG That 's completely ridiculous . I was freed December 29 , 1970 . Barbie was first identified , I believe , at the end of 1971 . [Int] . Are you revolted by the theory that your case thwarted efforts to get Barbie ? [Debray] It was
zone1	been so , I 'd have known all about it - [Int] . In jail/ - Yes , in jail and afterwards . My friends would have known . [French] diplomats were incompetent and indifferent . If Klaus Barbie had waved a flag " My name 's Klaus Barbie , " They 'd never say " The Nazi . " They let him walk around La Paz . When they saw him , they 'd cross the street . They could n't live with a Barbie/Altmann . When that [French] TV crew came to La Paz , the [French] consul hand-delivered Barbie 's fee for the interview . [French] officials may have known Altmann/Barbie 's whereabouts . But one thing is sure ... A policy existed , for the diplomats to do nothing , whoever was responsible . No instructions were given to our embassies down there to start extradition procedures ... even to look for Barbie . **33;7274;TOOLONG Pompidou was a bit nervous . because he 'd always heard too many people talk about resistance . So he got the jumps I think , when people started talking about
zone1	a little less about it . int . [French] Pompidou wanted extradition ? Deep down , perhaps , he did n't think it was a very urgent issue . In 1972 it took a few days to persuade the Bolivians to bring Barbie to me . First they said " You 'll go to his house blindfolded so you wo n't know the address . " " You 'll have 3 minutes interview time . " " enough for him to say he 's nobody but Mr Altmann . " [German] The prosecutors in Munich will be able to forward the file . so the Bolivian authorities can set the record straight . [French] They wanted us to speak [Spanish] , but I spoke [German] . [German] Barbie 's wife and children have exactly the same names and ages as your own . That could be . There are many such coincidences in life . After a while I said in [French] , " Were you over in Lyon ? " Try asking that of someone who does n't speak [French] ! He told me , " I never set
zone1	mine . [German] Could you say something in [French] ? Just a few words ? Say what ? " Comment allez-vous ? " [Journalist] , [French] " I was n't in the Gestapo . " I was n't in the Gestapo . Then he said " I 'm not a murderer and a torturer . " In a voice that was very Germanic , very guttural . I am not a murderer . I 'm not a torturer . I 'm not a torturer . I was never in the Gestapo in Lyon . [German] What was that ? [French] I was never in the Gestapo in Lyon . [French] I was never in the Gestapo ... Lyon . Journ . In Lyon I do n't know Jean Moulin . I do n't know ... Se ? or Molino ... as we say here . Before me was an ageing cop , who , with some help from the mountain sun , had mellowed in retirement . He seemed to have lost some of his professional reflexes . [German] According to what I read in Paris-Match , [French] We had
zone1	was hardly known at the time ... hardly published . [German] Anything to say to the [French] ? No , I have nothing against the [French] . Never did . On the contrary , I used to deal with them , do business with them . [Int] . [French] Yet in Bolivia he threatened them . I think he said on film ... When I mentioned the Eichmann case , he said to me , [German] If the same happens to me , it 'll be a bad day for France . This is Klaus Barbie 's home . He lived here for 2 years until 1981 . I was standing here 1981 , together with Marisa Bell-Schumacher from The New York Times We were both doing a story for The Times , and knocking on the door hear . [Int] . Was he looking at you while you were ... I saw him looking from this window . Then he disappeared . After waiting , we were about to leave after taking pictures , and a van showed up and about 12 paramilitary armed with submachine guns , showed
zone1	asked us what we were doing here , then put us under arrest , put us in the van and took us to military headquarters . It was a place headed by Colonel Guido [Vildoso] . We were held about 5 hours . But they realized that by having arrested us , they were in serious trouble Two people working for The New York Times were arrested for trying to reach Klaus Barbie . So they released us after 5 hours . Guido [Vildoso] ordered our release . A year later Guido [Vildoso] was president of Bolivia . One of the first visitors he had to the palace was Barbie . - [Spanish] Guido [Vildoso] ? - Yes sir . [Vildoso] No comment . I 'm not authorizes by the commander-in-chief . Would you speak for film on Barbie ? When you led the seventh , do you remember ? You arrested some journalists , and when you ... I 'm very sorry but you 'll need the commander-in-chief 's authorization . He has been president of Bolivia ? [Spanish] Yes , he was president . I do n't want
zone1	terms , he can not speak . Does he remember what the arrest ... [Spanish] Do you recall arresting ... Journ . He remembers that . [Spanish] Many thanks Mr President - My pleasure and so sorry . - Sure , of course . [Vildoso] I assume the presidency by a mandate from our nation 's armed forces , at a critical time in the history of Bolivia , when it would seem all our values , ethical , moral , spiritual and material , are crumbling . with unforeseeable consequences for the destiny of our nation . Good afternoon . We 'd like your impressions for a film on Barbie . Can you describe him personally ? How was it living beside him so long Were they nice people ? And his wife ? How was it when his son died ? He was a very normal person . We got along well . He was a gentleman . I do n't know many private things . - Was he very nice ? - As a neighbor , yes . [book_publisher] [German] Barbie visited my bookstore , until we
zone1	wife also bought [German] magazines . We 've been the only [German] bookstore in Bolivia for the past 40 years . We already knew who he was . We kicked his wife out for another reason , unaware who she was . She was such an obnoxious customer , haggling over everything , that we said , We do n't need your business . " [Spanish] He asked me over a few times . At first he thought I was Jewish . Journ . He thought he was Jewish . [Spanish] And this had made things difficult . Journ . That was the difference , he thought he was Jewish . [German] When Barbie first got here , he did business with Jews , who , of course , had no idea who he was , where he was from , or what he represented . [Spanish] Well , with us ... we 're not Jews , we 're Bolivians . - Once he understood that ... - Journ . You got on better ? He was much friendlier ... warmer , more open ... [German] My bookstore and press
zone1	. He had much more influence that we thought . He told me he had an office at the ministry of the interior , and private guards . [Int] . Under Banzer and Garcia Meza ? That 's right . Banzer had me arrested . A squad of storm-troopers came , maybe 6 or 8 ... in the commotion I did n't count them ... with machine guns and all , to clear out my books . They said to me , " Why do n't you pick out which books are subversive ... " " and threaten Bolivia 's freedom ? " I said , " That 's impossible . " " Either all are subversive or none are . " They burned them all . I was put in a private jail , guarded by young paramilitaries , all shouting very proudly , " We 're the Gestapo ! Fascists ! " " We 're on the watch ! We 're the Gestapo . " A great honor for them . [writer] [French] Barbie , if you will , is a man of conviction , of consistency ,
zone1	racist and political . That 's why , in Bolivia , he immediately became active . in intelligence , the army , and police repression . He did n't have to do this . He was n't defending Germany . In 1972 there was an abortive attempt to return him to France , via Chile . [Debray] and I went to Santiago . We flew to the Bolivian border . Karsfeld had data I did n't have , and vice versa . Our motives differed but we joined forces when I saw him in Santiago . He said why he wanted Barbie . To me Barbie was simply Moulin 's killer . Karsfeld knew he was guilty of much more than that . In 1973 General Pinochet replaced Allende . Our plans were off . As a [French] Latino , I went to South America ... to take part in movements like those I 'd missed ... the Resistance , Spain . [Int] . You felt a need for commitment ? You might say Barbie was living proof I was n't entirely wrong . It was the same struggle against
zone1	. [Spanish] Yes , shortly before he was arrested , he lived here on the 3rd floor . Hey , who gave you permission ... - [Man] Do n't do that ! - I do n't care ! This is a private residence . I 'll report you ! I do n't understand [Spanish] . But I know who lived here ... It was Klaus Barbie . And that 's what you do n't want us to film , is n't it . [Spanish] I do n't care ! Talk to me in [Spanish] . Mr De Castro , what were we talking about when we were so rudely interrupted ? I do n't remember . [French] Alvaro De Castro had decided to kidnap me , to exchange me for Barbie . It was a madcap idea . [Int] . When was this , in 1984 ? Just a few months after Barbie was returned . In the face of conclusive evidence , De Castro confessed in Bolivia . - [Int] . Who 'd finance it ? - Money 's no problem in Bolivia . For all its supposed marginality
zone1	. This " poor " country is rolling in dollars . The main drug lord is now setting up an arts foundation to promote Bolivian culture worldwide . There 's all sorts of culture here . The coco plant 's one kind , pre-Colombian art is another . When the dictatorship fell , Beate and I remembered the promise we had made . to the mothers of the Izieu children , to bring Barbie to justice . So we convinced the [French] president this operation was worthwhile . Our friend G.S . Salazar became head of security , and quickly resolved the Barbie case . [Spanish] When he was arrested , I did n't see him . We simply held him for non-payment of a debt . Altmann , a Bolivian , could n't be expelled . Barbie , a [German] living here illegally , could be . He felt secure . He did n't think we 'd expel him . But when we got into the car , I told him he was being expelled , not transferred . He thought that meant Germany . So , it 's
zone1	... like anyone else . [French] Over a span of 40 years and 2 continents , the " arm of justice ' brought Barbie back to the scene of his crimes . Journ . [Spanish] Do you think the past is done with ? It 's passed , buried . You regret nothing you 've done in your life ? Personally no . I can say no . If you could relive it , would you do the same ? You ca n't relive the past . Life is never the same . Repeat it and it 's different . It 's full of complications , trials and errors . Did you make any mistakes ? Of course ! Have n't you ? Are you still a Nazi ? The word Nazi does n't exist . It 's used ... I do n't know ... Can you explain to me what Nazi means ? [Children_singing_in_German] [Anchorman] , [French] While the press awaited the arrival of Barbie at Lyon airport , his plane landed at 8pm at Orange Air Force Base . It had flown him from [French] Guyana . [warden_of_Montluc_prison]
zone1	La Paz . You 're asking what I think as an average Frenchman ? 40 years after is a bit late . All civilized countries have secret services . They can have individuals killed abroad no matter where . I 'm [French] and I say had France wished to dispose of Barbie in those 40 years it had plenty of chances ! [Anchorman] Barbie was brought to this prison under heavy guard . He will be formally charged by Judge Jacques Riss , with crimes against humanity . Here 's the cell Barbie occupied for a week . It was arranged exactly like this , during his one-week stay here . Except the pictures you see on the walls were n't there during Barbie 's occupancy . [Int] . Those naked girls ? The scantily-clad girls were n't up on the wall when Barbie was here . He left after a week for security reasons . [Int] . This is n't maximum security ? You see the building overlooking the exercise yard ? At exercise period , a sniper could easily have shot him . At the least movement in
zone1	camped out night and day trying to get a scoop . He said his life was over . His wife and son dead . He was 71 at the time . He said he did n't care what happened . Once we were talking , he said to me , " If there 's anything we should ban , it 's war . " " As long as it 's around though , only one can speak . The winner . " [Spanish] In war you have to win . Losers lose everything . I 've forgotten . If THEY have n't , then it 's their problem . In any case I 've forgotten . [Children_singing_in_German] Jacques Verg ? s - Attorney at law [French] The film 's about to start . I 'm their prisoner , I ca n't get up . Would you close the door then ? Another crew is coming at 5 . Have them wait in the blue parlor . [Int] . Why would some people agree to be interviewed only if Verg ? s is n't ? It attests to his diabolical skill
zone1	man comes to France . He is presumed guilty , said to be indefensible . I ask , " Why not defend him , and prove no case in indefensible for a lawyer ? " This is satisfying enough . I 'm the cheerful type . I had another reason , too , for taking the case . I 'm Eurasian , you know . I grew up in a colonial society . Frankly , I ca n't say I 'm a victim of racial discrimination , now . I 'm not . But I 've lived in a society full of discrimination . I defended Algerian freedom fighters . As an attorney , I believe that defending an individual against any state is a function the defense must perform . You 're giving him free publicity ! This is disgusting ! He 's as cowardly as his client , and just as offensive . You 're all the same ! After the army , I became a student activist in Paris , with other students : Vietnamese , Cambodian , Moroccan . [Int] . Communist ? I left the
zone1	disagreed with the party 's policy on the colonial question . With Algerian independence , I move to Algiers . I married , I practised law . The Algerian government asked me to defend the first Palestinian Fedayeen arrested . That was 1965 . [investigative_journalist] The question to ask Verg ? s , the one he evades , is what did he do in the gap 1970-78 ? An absence so total that his wife was declared a widow ! I left the Algiers practice , then for 8 years ... [Int] . The Verg ? s gap ! I led a private life . I wo n't elaborate . I have no political ambitions , not being a candidate for office , I feel no need to explain . **38;7309;TOOLONG He 's always been a sly politician . All his life a 1st rate politician . A remarkable man , not just a lawyer ... Courageous . Not one bit ! That 's not the word . It took courage to defend Barbie after the Algerian bomb-throwers . [film_maker] I was shocked to see the attorney , who used
zone1	Barbie . I guess I do n't understand lawyers . In October ' 84 , Ibrahim Abdallah was arrested in Lyon . And who do you think he hires ? Jacques Verg ? s . The recent Paris bombings were to force Abdallah 's release . I do my job . I 'm completely my own man , no outside ... int . I did n't ask that yet ! Money the usual question . People marvel when I say I 'm not paid . Barbie 's not the only one . There 's also Mr Abdallah . I do it for free . int . Let me ask a question . Who is Genoud ? Who 's Fran ? ois Genoud ? A Swiss financier . Not a banker as people claim . A rather complicated life . He flirted a bit with the Third Reich . He was totally pro-Nazi before and during the war . I met him during the Algerian War , at Arab parties in Switzerland . Later he dealt with the PLO movement . Habash 's ultra-Marxist wing . - [Int] . Genoud is
zone1	see a contradiction in this swing from extreme left to the extreme right . Yet those extremes meet , fighting the Jews and Israel . It 's the old ploy : Go after the lawyer when you ca n't build a case . And Verg ? s began acting as prosecutor instead of defender . It 's cigars you smell , not brimstone . The best Havana cigars . I am a lawyer . When people want to lynch a man , my instinct is to shield him , and say " they 'll do it over my dead body . " Do you believe in human justice in a bourgeois society ? I believe in the rules we operate by . [Int] . In our society ? Verg ? s In the Barbie case I 'm defending . [Usher] Court 's in session ! The judicial system against false use . [Children_singing_in_German] His morale 's good and his health 's bad , for a reason nobody disputes . A month before his arrest in Bolivia , he had a stroke , that left him with a slight limp and
zone1	is the kind prison vets give their livestock ... aspirin for headaches , and sleeping pills . And laxatives . Not much of a treatment for his ailment . My request he be examined by experts of my choice was refused . Never under France 's 40 kings , five republics and two emperors , have over 10 years separated crime and trial . He told me , " In 3 years I have n't seen an animal , a plant , or even the sky . Total solitary confinement is inhuman . [French] How did Verg ? s get the case ? Well , there 's Barbie 's daughter , a librarian in Vienna . - No in Kurfstein . - Well , in Austria anyway . She 's allowed to see her father , and she wanted Verg ? s to defend him . [German] It 's not easy to help in a situation like this . All we can do is to continue to visit him . [French] He needed background from those who knew him . Naturally , his daughter knew him best . [Int] .
zone1	's the age difference . [Int] . Yes , people always know one side of a person . Of course , she 'd have to defend him . [German] You say Nazi , but how clear is that ? [Int] . A Nazi leader ... a Hitlerian leader . It 's hard for me to speak of Nazis , since I ca n't really explain what a national socialist is . No one has ever explained it to me . That 's why I say that ... But I interrupted you . I 'm sorry . My mother played the piano . So did he . Classical music . But also pop tunes . He loved to sing , too . We all enjoyed singing . We sang all the time . We were a very very happy family . [French] Mrs Messner pulled out all the stops for us . What do you expect . She 's his daughter . [Int] . Can you say that in [French] ? - In [French] ? - Yes . He is a very good father . Very loving , very tender .
zone1	very nice to me , even after my husband died . Mrs Crozier knew him in Bolivia , and could vividly describe him . He had many friends . He helped friends with their problems . - [Int] . A good man . - Yes , good . This young woman had been deceived , because when she married Barbie 's son she did n't know who her father-in-law was . [Int] . Are you sure ? - I 'm quite sure . [Int] . [French] Did you know about his past ? No , I did n't know exactly , but still , I felt there was something ... [Int] . To hear you speak of his love for your children , knowing he 's been charged with atrocities in Lyon , is jarring . It 's jarring for us , too . Think of this woman with 3 children named Barbie . What a legacy ! I 'm not the only Frenchwoman to marry a [German] . [Choir_sings_German_folk_song] [French] I was 18 in 1944 , and in those days I was , like most young people then ,
zone1	rationed . There were coupons for bread , meat , butter , for oil and all the fats . Coupons for everything , even potatoes . There was a caf� ? in Lyon , which was frightful ... because it was one of the few places which was cheap . And you had a lot of people in it , who knew it was cheap . When you go into a caf� ? and you see a lot of people who wink at you ... you do n't go next time , because you know this is dangerous . [French] Restaurants served army people , militia men , the Gestapo , in order to serve other clients , too . During the war , restaurants played it both ways ... one room for the Resistance , one for the Germans . The best caf� ? I went to , was one next to the Gestapo . - Le Moulin ? Vente ? - No , it was called La Concorde . [restaurant_proprietor] [French] The main topic was Montluc . and those poor men there . - It was Barbie 's
zone1	, that nice house on the corner . A very convenient caf� ? , because it was full of Germans and Gestapo people . So the Gestapo would n't dream of looking for someone there . Whereas the other caf� ? , with the Resistance people , was dangerous ... but you had to eat somewhere . - [French] People were hungry . - Thirsty too . - Crispy skin chicken . - Here . People then were hungry . Lots of dried vegetables Ration coupons for everything ! One time , Mr Vettard found a lobster . We hid it to eat that night after we closed . We sat down to eat it in private . Then a [German] officer saw us and came in . " What a feast ! " He sat down with us . - He ate it all ? - We had to give him some . Of course ... it was a time when ... What dreadful things we remember . [New_York_Times] I remember my interview last autumn with the [French] President and Mitterand , who brought Barbie back ... I asked
zone1	afraid of having Vichy really exposed as collaborationist . He said Vichy was n't collaborationist ... there were collaborationists within Vichy . The Vichy government was not collaborationist , he said and I do n't know how to translate it into English ... It was spineless . I said to myself " I want to interview this man ... after he 's no longer president , and see what he says then . " When I took 2 or 3 people who are 50 or 60 years old and who lived through the war ... they say the [French] Resistance did a lot of good things ... and it 's the only [French] thing that saved the honor of France . But part of the Resistance , that came later , much later ... are the one's who speak out loud about what the [French] Resistance was . What you 're saying , is that for you as a schoolgirl in France , the Resistance was not heroic . Yes , there 's a flaw somewhere in the middle . So you have some admiration or love or respect for
zone1	I 'm someone who 's 27 and maybe having stupid ideals ... I think I knew they were fighting each other . **27;7349;TOOLONG [French] Especially at that time ... disagreements were at first over politics , strategy , method , out of which grew ... since there are no angels in politics or war ... personality clashes , ambition and rivalries . With Jean Moulin gone , Frenay began negotiating directly with the US secret services in Switzerland ... - With Allen Dulles ? - Allen Dulles . To get arms and money in exchange for military information . But to have a Swiss connection was perfectly normal , with none of the drawbacks . [Int] . Moulin was against it . Moulin was n't against it . De Gaulle was . Can any government allow a private citizen to negotiate with a foreign power . - [Int] . Foreign but allied . - Allies are foreign . Not enemies ... but foreigners . [Int] . In a war , an ally is an ally . Listen , de Gaulle was right ... in always treating the allies like the
zone1	knew of the Resistance 's rivalries , and of the contacts between Dulles in Bern with some of the Resistance groups . He was well-informed . [Int] . Barbie maintains he belonged to the Canaris-Karl Wolff group , that had contacts with the Americans . producerof " TheBitterTruth " He once said , " I not only knew , but received orders . " int . Is that how he explains why the Americans protected him after the war ? He was hired immediately . [Int] . In ' 45 ? - Yes . Immediately after leaving Lyon in ' 44 , he was protected . [Int] . So his arrival in Memmingen in ' 47 was no accident ? Is that your theory ? My theories end with Moulin 's arrest . 3 years after Barbie 's return , we 're discussing the exact judicial scope of the indictment , and what charges are to be made . The court decided that " war crimes " could be also " crimes against humanity " . - Which means ... - The Appeals Court decided ? The Appeals Court ,
zone1	humanity ... Which he 's never denied . I think you 're wrong to confuse the 2 issues . It 's more important to confront Barbie with the horror of his systematic murder of people who were different . We are told of limits for war crimes , and that it 's pointless to question this . But since crimes against humanity are n't prescribed , somebody like Barbie comes in very handy . His case became a symbol for the entire Nazi regime . [Int] . It may seem shocking to many people that lethal torture , gratuitous sadism be forgotten . Who is forgetting ? These are war crimes , and they , like crimes of terrorism , have a 20-year limit on prosecution . The only crime exempt against this is the crime against humanity ... as was decided at Nuremberg and adopted by France in ' 64 . It is a crime against a whole population on the basis of its origins . There 's been a huge amount of propaganda during the last number of years .. in order to try and prove that the
zone1	crimes against Jews . I know of no others . So , it took up a large part of the press . [French] The only children deported from France were Jews and Gypsies . [Int] . And the non-Jewish children at Izieu ? And in the raid on Izieu , the only non-Jewish child , once properly identified , was let off the truck by the Germans . and allowed to go home . And I think that the [French] court ... get nervous , get upset if one says " Crimes from the Nazis ... only against the Jews . " They could have said crimes of the Nazis also against the Gypsies . But the [French] people do n't like the Gypsies ! Why bring them in ? So you have to demonstrate the crime was against good [French] . And " good [French] " ? ... what is a " good [French] " ? The Resistance was . It 's why they want to be in the Resistance ... because everybody wants to ... " Get in on the act " of the victim ! [French] Why
zone1	mind ? Why are they afraid ? It 's because it has all become a political affair . How can you even hold such a trial , when no one puts war crimes and crimes against humanity in Algeria on the stand ? I was told that 's different . Now the appeals court agrees with me . It counts all the horrors of war as crimes against humanity . We ca n't avoid the premise on which Barbie 's defense will rest . Was n't torture necessary for obtaining information ? Then they will say the [French] did the same thing in Algeria . Massu 's books admit use of torture . Argout 's books admit that bored paratroopers on leave slew women and children for kicks . localleaderofright-wing " NationalFront " ... You 're saying that if Le Pen tortured people in Algeria it was on government orders ? I think so . [Int] . But that 's Barbie 's defense , that he was following orders ... the classic defense . That obviously raises questions of group responsibility which are far from being ... [Int] . "
zone1	are orders . " The classic defense in all war-crime trials . So Verg ? s is right ? That 's a trick question . Verg ? s is doing his job . My personal opinion ? It 's an old story . It 's old business by now . It was 40 years ago . nationalleaderof " NationalFront " I 'm fascinated by WW2 history . I 'd like to ask certain questions . I 'm not saying there were no gas chambers ... Of course I never saw any myself . I studied it . But I think it 's a minor point in WW2 history . [Journalist] 6 million Jews is a minor point ? [Journalist] 6 million dead . Did I misunderstand ? Journ . Dead Jews ... is that a minor point ? But the question is how and whether they were killed , right ? - But that 's no minor point . - It is for the war . [Int] . You deny that the " Final Solution " was a plot to murder people ? I deny that my client participated in
zone1	. **29;7378;TOOLONG [German] So often people knew that these Jewish people were sent to death camps to be killed . [Int] . [French] Memos from Dannecker were circulated to Gestapo agents , instructing them how to herd Jews to the gas chambers . Are you claiming that your client did not receive them ? One of the many odd things about this unusual file , is that you , Mr Ophuls , knew of this document , while I , the defense , was n't shown it . Prosecutor-general , Lyon No document used in establishing our case in the pre-trial hearings , came from outside that file . [Int] . the prosecution has the document . Yes , but it was n't given to me . All the documents are in the record . [Int] . the defense has access to it ? All parties did , without exception . - The defense also ? - Particularly the defense . Verg ? s never studies files . Anything goes . [German] As you know , the authenticity of the documents has just been contested by the defense . We
zone1	no surprise . I told the prosecutor myself , and he conceded it was his first trial of this sort . Our lawyers in Nazi trials also started off questioning [on_French_TV_news] If they say the documents prove that Barbie is responsible for transferring Jewish children from Lyon to Drancy , I 'm forced to state that it 's a crude forgery . int . Do you still question the authenticity of the telex ? More than ever . [Int] . Was it altered ? Was it forged ? It 's a fake . This " fake " must have predated Nuremberg . But I was too young to be a forger then , because Verg ? s claims I was behind the forgery . Only there is no forgery . At Nuremberg ... [Int] . But Klarsfeld was too young ... The [French] envoy 's age , but never mentioned Barbie 's name was typed below it . [Int] . [German] So it 's implied the issue is that Jewish groups forged it after the war . How would the Allies at the end of the war , have known
zone1	. [Int] . Even at Nuremberg , the telex was signed ? Yes , even in 1946 at Nuremberg , it was debated , as was the whole case of the Izieu children . [French] The photostats were published repeatedly , but their composition was changed for layout purposes . int . Verg ? s played on that . Yes , but you saw what happened in court . While Verg ? s spoke , the jurors was looking at the original . [Choir_sings_German_folk_song] [Int] . Mr Prosecutor , while Barbie was in the courtroom , why did you ask him to speak about his youth ? Because I think there 's a basic issue in this case : How can crimes against humanity be committed by a man ? There is a man . Who is he ? [Journalist] What made you decide to leave ? [German] I have nothing to say . [German] Nothing to say . [Journalist] Nothing to say ? specialcorrespondent " Liberation " [French] Can they extradite him ? No . I ca n't see what grounds they would have . I 'll send you
zone1	n't know yet if Holford and Streim testify today , or witnesses of the raid on Ugif , Barbie 's raid on the Union of [French] Jews office . They 'll be the first real witnesses . It 'll be a good story . [professor_of_languages] Behind that table ... desk ... was Barbie . He started asking me questions in [German] ... and I did n't understand . I pretended that I did n't understand a word of [German] . There was literally a captive audience . Some of them I knew very well . - Most of them died ? - All of them . There were 3 Gestapo officers right behind me ... one of them was very close behind me . Practically behind my left ear . Pulled out a gun ... I could hear the click ... Saying in a low voice into my left ear ... but to the 2 others ... In [German] , well ... " I may as well finish him off . " I controlled by reflexes , because I knew if I showed any sign I understood ... My fate
zone1	did not understand [German] ... and he gathered all my documents , my papers ... and handed them to me and said " You can go . " [Int] . [French] Mr Truche You 've challenged several witnesses ' credibility . Why did you challenge Michel Thomas ? My idea of serving justice is to rely only on evidence that can not be contested . [Int] . What makes Thomas less credible than the others ? His story is inconsistent . Sometimes true stories seem hard to believe . I ca n't build my case on what is hard to believe . [agricultural_worker] [Int] . Mr [Favet] , I came here last February . There was snow , and it was lovely in fact . You refused to see us then , you would n't give an interview . Could you say why ? I had at least one good reason ... [Favet] I 've about had it ! [Int] . What ? - I 've had it with the TV - You 've had it ? Julien [Favet] is a very fine man . He really feels what he
zone1	" You are to condemn a man for serious crimes , " " on testimony of a witness who 40 years back , " " saw someone for a few seconds . " int . More than that . He says it was 2 or 3 minutes . And he knew the children . It was a major event in his life . Of course , his testimony about the children ... They liked me . I used to play with them . [Int] . You mentioned his accident . You used the word " lobotomy " . That seems to have been a mistake . I doubt I used it in court . If I did use it in came from the file . - A mistake in the files ? - Possibly . [Int] . Still , it has an impact on this man 's life , challenging his credibility . [attorney_at_law] [Favet] is handicapped ... an accident with a tree branch . [Int] . When he was a child ? Later , felling trees . More recently , after the war . I summoned [Favet] because he
zone1	well that his credibility had been questioned . [Int] . Do the villagers believe him ? Oh , yes ! Besides , he was n't alone . It was the morning of April 6 , 1944 . As usual , I got up very early . It was already full daylight . The boss told me to dig near the vines , to plant asparagus . As I was crossing the yard , 2 of the kids called from the dormitory windows , " Mr Julien ! tell Mrs Perticos " ... the wife of my boss ... " we ca n't take the cows out this morning . " " We have to clean the dorm . " These 2 brothers often came over . Had they that morning , they would have been saved . **29;7409;TOOLONG . [Favet] is the type who belongs to the land . - int . To France ? - To the land . Some kids , 7 , 8 , 10 years old ... tried to jump off the truck . With my own eyes , it 's true , I saw a
zone1	He probably told you how the children brought him breakfast every day . The day the Germans came , he went out for a look , because no one had brought him his food . Maybe those kids would have been found eventually , but somebody sped things up by betraying them . [Int] . They were betrayed ? Yes , by the militia . [Int] . Informed on ... do you know by whom ? Did you see the informer ? Yes , one of them , anyway . [Int] . When , and how ? - Mr Bourdon . - Yes ? Barbie was with a militiaman . Another , identically dressed , was beside him . That was Mr Bourdon . All three were leaning on the big stone troughs in the yard . Barbie stayed 3 or 4 minutes , conferring with them . He was facing me . He said something to me which I understood as " Get out . " He turned and walked away . I left . He was n't called to testify at the first trial in 1947 , not
zone1	? - Yes , the informer . Perticos was called to testify , not [Favet] . Perticos was a farmer . He 's dead now . Julien [Favet] was his hired hand . Back then , servants never testified if their masters did . [Int] . So what became of Bourdon ? - No idea . Never saw him again . - he never returned ? Oh no ! It was n't the time for that . [Int] . [German] witnesses could have testified whether or not Barbie was present . But [German] witnesses wo n't come to France to testify in such trials . It 's easier to blame everything on Barbie and the SS . Barbie and the SS are the murderers . Open and shut case . The case is closed . Even today , the Wehmacht is still ... So no one wanted to explore that side of it . The problem was n't who arrested the children , but who , when they got to Montluc that evening , decided to send them on to Germany to their deaths . It 's monstrous to see
zone1	the stomach , hit with gun butts , and carted off to the gas chambers . [Woman] Before the arrests , the Resistance supplied us . [Int] . The local partisans ? - Yes . And from the Jura [mountains] . [Int] . Did they know that Jewish children were hidden there ? They knew very well . [Int] . And the village , apart from the pro-Vichy mayor ? My husband saw the villagers often . He bought vegetables from the farmers . I remember old man Zlatin . - [Int] . Old man Zlatin . - Yes . He came daily for milk and vegetables . I do n't know what they thought . Some were for the mayor ... others against . [Int] . The pro-Vichy mayor ? - Yes . Even though the mayor was n't invited , to the monument 's inauguration , he was re-elected twice after the war . On the monument , there 's a line from Hemingway . " We are part of the continent , " and each time a man dies , we die a little . " There
zone1	the continent and Izieu was a small part of the continent . I was introduced to Barbie in Judge Riss 's presence . I was seated at an oval table . There was also a secretary and Mr Verg ? s . [Int] . Who questioned ? - No one . - No questions ? - Sometimes Verg ? s smiled . It was as if he thought " Anything this man says is rubbish . " The charges are unfounded . Barbie is on trial as a member of an organization . What notions of justice . Collective responsibility again He said to reporters , " The more precise the witness statement was , " The more fun we had . " This trial is staged against France . It tries to reopen old wounds . So I think for the sake of justice , truth and France ... we must say " No and no again ! " Everything I said to Verg ? s , felt like autumn leaves . You rake them up or you let them rot ... no difference . I say this trial
zone1	France will be divided . Continuing our past , and it 's time to go over ... to go forward . [writer] [French] It 's 10.30 - and we are awaiting a verdict . For me , this trial is pessimism . The notion of a crime against humanity ... the charge against Barbie was never clarified . The defense deliberately obscured it . The State did n't present it properly . All along we should have pondered and deplored the fact that a black , and Arab , a Bolivian , and Verg ? s , who claims Asian ancestry , rose to defend a Nazi , and did so because of their race ... their non-European status . Imagine someone in 1945 , at the end of the war , predicting in 20 or 30 years , an SS torturer , charged and convicted , would be defended by the people the Nazis deemed subhuman . It would have been a big joke . It 's a victory for democracy , every time a defense lawyer can plead as he sees fit . What I would point out
zone1	Not one extenuating circumstance was granted , every defense argument was rejected . I would point out that Lieutenant Barbie was sentenced to life imprisonment . whereas at Nuremberg ... Hitler 's successor , Admiral Donitz , did not receive a life sentence . Clearly we are outdoing out mentors . [Journalist] Will you appeal ? Verg ? s We 'll file an appeal tomorrow of course . [attorney-at-law] Justice , only justice , and I 'm very proud of the [French] justice . local " LeProgr ? s " correspondent [French] I was at school when some children from Izieu were boarding with our principal . [Int] . In Belley ? - Yes . Next to me was a boy from the Izieu home named Mayer Bulka , whose parents came from Poland , and had been rounded up in the famous Vel d'Hiv raid in Paris . Mayer knew perfectly well where his parents were . He knew . [Int] . When he was in school , did he know his parents had been deported ? They all suspected as much . Maurice Gerenstein and Max Balsam said
zone1	a desk . Bulka was very withdrawn and often very sad . I remember the 3 boys as being outstanding students , especially in mathematics . The older one's knew something was up . Either someone told them , or they figured it out . I do n't know which . But the little one's ... how could they understand ? [Man] A letter from Alice Jacqueline Lutzgart , 10 years old , to her mother in southern France . February 26 , 1944 . " Dear Mummy , thank you for the clogs . " My feet will be warm now " The snow is melting here and the sun is out . " Soon it will be spring . " How nice ! Spring is lovely with the trees blossoming " and budding . " I hope you got my letter asking you to take pictures . " I forget what the south looks like . " Of course I was very small when I lived there . " Fanny 's going to send me the blue checkered skirt . " I have nothing else to say ,
zone1	kiss . " Your loving daughter Jacqueline . " [Woman] I was so happy in this yard . [Int] . Where did you live ? - On the top floor . My father was washing his hands when the SS rang the doorbell . He looked out and saw the SS blocking both exits . We had 2 doors . I know you , you 're the tenant , or is that another gentleman ? - You look alike . [Int] . No . I do n't live here . but you must know Mrs Lagrange . Yes , but I ca n't quite place her . Mrs Lagrange lived on the floor above you . But ... - Simone Kaddouche . - Eh ? I 'm Simone Kaddouche . I lived here . - In Mrs Kaddouche 's time ? - Yes . How could I recognize you ? People change . - You have n't changed . - Sure I have , I 'm 77 ! What did you say your maiden name was ? - Kaddouche . - Kaddouche . I would n't have recognized you .
zone1	[Int] . Were you here when the Kaddouches were arrested ? - Yes . - [Int] . Did you see it ? Yes , I moved here in 1942 . [Int] . Then you were here when the SS came . - When what ? - [Int] . When the SS came I ca n't recall if it was in the street or here . So you 're the Kaddouches who were deported ? Oh ... and you were the oldest girl , the one who had the luck to return ? - It 's you ! - It 's me . I would n't have known . Your parents did n't return ? - They didn't . - How sad . - I 'll never forget that . - Neither will I . Of course not ... I 'll never forget it . - The day I was arrested ... - Eh ? The day I was arrested , you were home . - Mrs Bontout lived opposite . - That 's right . She alone tried to get me away from the SS . Oh yes ... Mrs
zone1	one we just met ? - Yes . Mrs Bontout was over here . She let my mother and father pass . Then she tugged at my sleeve to pull me into her place , safe from the SS . - [Int] . Why did n't it work ? - Goitzman turned around . He came back and forced me down the stairs .. Mrs Bontout got slapped so hard she had to give up . [Int] . And where was Mrs Serr ? s ? She 'd shut herself away . I do n't know what became of Mrs Bontout , but I feel a fondness for her I do n't feel for anyone else . - [Int] . Did you see her again ? - No . This motion picture is dedicated to the late Mrs Bontout , a good neighbor . [Choir_sings_German_folk_song]

[Laughter] So then he turns to me and says , I 'll give you fifteen million dollars to walk out of this room and forget we ever existed . [Laughs] I looked him straight in the eye and I said no . [Laughter] [Corey] That was a great story ... [Walter_Graham] The gall of some people . [Corey] How much did you end up with ? [Walter_Graham] Huh ? You tell him , [Mike] . [Laughs] [Harvey] We walked but not before we got twenty-five million . [Laughter] [Rachel] You 're different than your two friends . I guess I am . But they 're okay . [Corey] is pre-law . [Lance] is

Why do you prefer the company of this kid to me ? Hm ? Why ? He has brains . [Walter_Graham] Brains ? What would you know about brains ? You are such a dumb broad ! Hey ! Wait a second . There 's no reason to talk to her like that . [Rachel] It 's okay . [Martin] . He 's just a little drunk . He 's making a joke . Mr . Graham and I are old friends . That 's right .
zone1	two will excuse me , I guess I should relieve [Albert] from the wheel . But that 's right , you go ahead because you 're sure not doing this party any good . * I 've been thinking about you . * - [Lance] Whoo ! Crank it ! - * [turns_music_up_on_radio] [Corey] Babe . Shall we tango ? * I know we have had some ups and downs . * [Meowing] * Ca n't help but keep coming around . * * So now I 'm back to let you know . * * I just do n't want to let you go . * * Give it one more try . Before moving ' down the line . * * One more try ... Tammy Faye Baker . This is for you . * [singing] Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord . * * He is ... Mmmm . * Trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored . * - He is ... - [Albert] ! Captain [Albert] . At your service , baby . You are

Get out of here . Aye ! Aye ! Baby ! - * [drunken_singing] - * [dramatic_music] [Drunk_mumbling] Ahhh ! Get my wine out of here . Yeah .

Walt . * Before movin ' down the line . * * One more try . * [dramatic_music] That stupid [Albert] must have hit his head and gone over . Whoo ! [Man] ! Just my luck ! Now that little miss captain is going to want to go back and look for him . Look , I just say we get out of here and we did n't see anything okay ? Yeah , okay . Of course , nothing is going to keep me from getting
zone1	same boat together remember . [Boat_rocking_on_the_water] * Out on the ocean . So what do you think ? - You like [Lance] . - [laughs] Yeah . He 's a real stud . Mmm . What about [Corey] ? He 's a little preoccupied with money . [Suzanne] Do n't you think ? Yeah . Tell me seriously . You would n't like living like this all the time ? Um hmmm . [Laughter] I could get used to it . [Laughs] **26;6022;TOOLONG What happened ? I do n't know exactly . She 's running way too hot . I had to shut her down . For how long ? If I had a half way decent crew , I would n't have to stop here in the first place . I ca n't even find that nitwit , [Albert] . * [suspenseful_music] [Meowing] [Martin] I ca n't find him . This is what I was afraid of . There was an accident . He must have fallen overboard . Oh , my god . [Rachel] I had a feeling this was going to be a bad day . You
zone1	na buy it . [Walter_Graham] Our little lady captain is going to jump at it . Looks like [Albert] fell overboard last night . What ! Are you sure ? [Rachel] We 've looked everywhere . That 's just awful . Well I have to notify the authorities and then we have to go back and look for him . Back track ? ! You got ta be kidding we ca n't be going back . Well , I 'm afraid that ca n't be helped . Considering the circumstances . [Walter_Graham] I had n't planned on telling you this until we arrived to port . [Walter_Graham] You see if we make my deadline , Let 's just say I 'll be a very rich man . And among other things , I wo n't be needing this boat anymore . Transfer of ownership papers ? In your name . All legit . And at a price that you can manage . That is if you think you can get your charter business going again . I 'm not trading a man 's life for a boat . [Walter_Graham] That
zone1	of me . I would n't either . [Mike] . Tell her . Well , yeah , it does n't make sense . We ca n't be spending all those days with authorities . Wasting their time . Wasting their money . Risking their lives for a body they ai n't gon na find . You ca n't be certain of that . Yes , I can . [Albert] could n't swim . - Is that true ? - I 'm afraid so . It 's a shame about [Albert] . I liked him . Yeah . Well , he 's shark bait now . Alright , make up your mind , Rach . Do you want the yacht or not ? I 'll have to make a record in my log . [Walter_Graham] Of course , I would expect no less . - Mmm . - [laughing] - Ahh ! Whoo ! - That 's right . [Splashing_water] * [suspenseful_music] We decided passage into the Cayman Islands . Captain 's decision . Based on ... [Door_opens] Do you have a sextant ? Yes . Why ? Can I take
zone1	a sextant is used for navigation . I know , I just want to try it out for something else here . Does this look like it could be [Albert] 's ? Could be . Why ? * [suspenseful_music] - Do you have any water ? Any liquid at all ? - Mmm hmm Hold that there . - Like that ? - Yeah . - [Rachel] What is it ? - * [suspenseful_music] Look . [Rachel] [Martin] . What am I looking at ? [Martin] Blood cells . This is a hundred , maybe even a thousand times normally for fresh blood . [Suzanne] And you think this is [Albert] 's blood ? Do n't you ? * [upbeat_music] [Meowing] [Blowing_out_air] I think you are better than Jane Fonda . Thanks . You know when I get this tugboat really going . There will be so much money . And mucho good life . It does n't look like you 're suffering too bad right now . [Laughs] This is nothing . [Meowing] You sure are one hell of a good looking woman . Thanks . When I saw
zone1	the sun , I nearly had to be restrained from leaping over the railing ... I guess that 's a compliment . Your perky little body is . [Walter] , I 'm trying to work out you know . Well you just forget about that because I 'm getting real tired of you girls leading me on . [Walter_Graham] For now on you are going to play it my way Or the game is over and you get out . Oh , [Walter] . We are miles out to sea . Now how am I gon na get out ? We 've got a life boat . [Laughs] You would n't dare ! You wan na bet ? [Laughs] [Walter] , now do n't be stupid . [Cat_screams] Hey ! What the hell you doing ? Hey just get lost kid . This is none of your business . Leave her alone ! [Crashing_glass] [meowing] - Stop it ! - Ow ! [Gunfire] [screams] What the hell is going on , Walt ? Dumb kid jumped me when I was n't looking . Oh yeah ? No you ca n't
zone1	Hold it ! ... - Nooo ! Stop . [Walter_Graham] Hold it ! [Lance] [Corey] ! [Screams] Ugh ! Oh ! Oh ! [Bobbie_cries] [Screams] [Gunfire] [Gunfire] [Gunfire] Oh . Oh . [Gunfire] Oh god . Oh , my god . We got ta stop the bleeding . I 'll get the first aid kit . What happened ? [Mike] , what happened ? Uh . Uh . The cat . The cat . Ugh ! [Heavy_breathing] Ugh ! [Heavy_breathing] His heart is racing a mile a minute . Ugh ! His pulse is going crazy . What happened to him ? He just went nuts . I 've never seen anything like this . This is not like him . The cat could n't have done this . Look , it 's right through the shoe . [Harvey] It was the cat . It 's crazy . There 's no way the cat could do that . I do n't see how either . [Martin] Somebody better get on the radio and get some medical assistance And fast or I 'm gon na lose this guy , huh .
zone1	[Rachel] [Suzanne] , come with me . [Door_closes] [Suzanne] , come here . Come here . Hold this button done and call , Mayday , Mayday . I 'm going to find where the nearest medical facility is . Put that thing down . - What are you doing ? - I said put the damn radio down ! Are you crazy ? We had a deal about getting straight to the Caymans , remember ? Those two people might die if we do n't get them to a doctor . The kid 's gon na be alright . [Mike] is my problem . Now do you want that boat or not ? Not with this much blood on it . Mayday ! Mayday ! This is the Caribbean Sun and we have a medical emergency . I repeat , Mayday ! Mayday ! [Gunfire] [explosion] Now start the engines and get us heading for the Caymans . I 'm not taking this boat anywhere . I do n't think you 're going to shoot the only person who can operate it . Fine . Then I 'll just blow
zone1	One at a time , Until you take me to where I want to go ! You would n't dare . You 're way outta your league , Sweetheart . - [Suzanne] Oh , my god . - [Walter_Graham] This one goes right between her eyes . - [screams] - Alright ! Stop it ! I 'll do it . Get this boat moving . Look , I 've told you that the engine is heating up . If it dies , we are dead in the water . And I ca n't guarantee I can fix it . You get this thing going right now ! - [Rachel_sighs] - [engine_cranking] Cut the crap [Rachel] and start this thing ! [Rachel] What the hell do you think I 'm trying to do . [Walter_Graham] Just get out of the way ! * [tense_music] - Stop it ! - [Walter_Graham] No way ! You just stand back . This thing is gon na start . [Mini_explosion] [Walter_Graham] What the hell happened here ? [Fire_extinguisher] [Coughing] [Walter_Graham] Wait . Wait . Stop . Hold it . Hold it . You ca n't
zone1	. Look , I 'm sorry okay . It 's just that I ... I ... [Walter_Graham] Wait . Wait . Wait . Stop . Hold it . You ca n't let her . I ... I ... I ... Okay I 'm sorry alright ! It 's just that I ... Yeah , you 're sorry . Yeah , you 'll get your chance . Keep the gun on the scumbag . [Rachel] But if he moves , blow his balls off ! - * [dramatic_music] - [Mike_moaning] As near as I can tell , the cat that bite Mr . [Harvey] is highly poisonous . A poisonous cat ? Now how is that possible ? I found a piece of bloodstained shirt this morning . [Rachel] and I took a pretty good look at the blood . And it was mutating like nothing I have ever seen or heard about before . [Moaning] - [Corey] Maybe the cat 's got rabies . - [Mike] Oh god . No . I 've seen rabies . I know what it does to the blood . This was a mutation .
zone1	[Bobbie] said she saw the cat running through the hall . Tell [Martin] what you told me . Well it all happened really fast . I do n't know it did n't look like the cat . But it had to be . I do n't know . His face was distorted or something . I do n't know . I mean , it sounds crazy . I do n't know . Did it look like a normal cat to you before , [Suzanne] ? Of course . It 's just a cat . Oh ... god ! [Martin] . Could this have anything to do with that laboratory tag that cat was wearing ? What are you talking about ? Shut up , Graham ! You know you have been a major disappointment to me . [Martin] [Suzanne] maybe on to something . There 's a great deal of experimentation on lab animals . Maybe somehow this cat 's system got some type of experimental chemicals in it . [Heavy_breathing] [rapid_heartbeat] [Martin] I do n't know . It seems to me that our cat Might administer that very same
zone1	were giving it some type of metabolic steroid . That might explain the strength to bite through the shoe . You mean they actually poisoned that poor cat and now it 's dangerous to all of us . All I know for sure is , that the blood cells in [Mike] 's body Are multiplying at a phenomenal rate . Somehow he has been poisoned . You got some of [Mike] 's blood on your hands . How come you 're not sick ? [Sighs] Most likely it can only be transmitted by actual contact with my blood by ingesting it . [Martin] Just touching it or getting it on my skin should n't hurt me . [Moaning_and_groaning] - Oh , god . - [rapid_heartbeat] Oh , god . [Moaning] * [intense_music] - Oh , god . - [rapid_heartbeat] * **26;6050;TOOLONG * [Big_splash] What 's going to happen to us ? [Martin] We 're gon na survive . We 're going to get this boat started and we 're going to survive . - [Walter_Graham] Is this really necessary ? - [Corey] Shut up . Now , I ca n't
zone1	're real lucky that they wo n't let me blow your head off . You would n't have the guts to shoot me even if they did let you , preppy . [Rachel] , I still got ta get to the Cayman Islands . That 's the least of our problems . Let 's go . [Door_closed_and_locked] * [suspenseful_music] How are you feeling ? I 'm okay . Really . - [creaking_sound] - What was that in the closet ? - Probably just a boat creak . - How do you know ? I mean what if it 's the cat ? - Do n't worry . I 'll go check , okay . - No . You stay here . I 'll do it . You sure ? Yeah . * [suspenseful_music] You ready ? * [suspenseful_music_swells] * [suspenseful_music_stops] [Laughs] [Sighs] [Rachel] It was just me and my father after that . The ship was his dream for both of us . Then we had some storm damage and dad got sick . We got behind on our payments from the bank . Graham owns the boat now .
zone1	back , I need to get this damn engine fixed . - You see this pump here ? - Yeah . It uh , brings sea water in to cool the engine . I got ta trace every hose and electrical wire . Uh , give me a hand . Alright . You got a lot of nice stuff here for a creep , Graham . That 's what happens when you got money , preppy ! Yeah , ai n't that the truth . And you do n't know the half of it . [Corey] Uh , uh , uh . You like that ? [Corey] You kidding me ? I always wanted one of these . - Keep it . - [Corey] What ? What are you deaf as well as dumb ? Go ahead . Take it . I have a drawer full of ' em . I guess you really are a rich S.O.B . , are n't you ? And getting richer all the time . Here let me show you ... Whoa ! Not so fast . Hey ! Take it easy , man
zone1	the wall safe . Okay . Nice and slow . [Sound_of_safe_lock_turning] [Safe_creaking_open] There . You can open it . Be my guest . Go ahead . But do it nice and slow so I can see everything . [Walter_Graham] Very well . Feast your eyes . - How much is that ? - [Walter_Graham] One million American dollars . - Cash . - [flipping_money] Buy a lot of watches . Well , opportunity is knocking . Wake up . Take a bundle . There 's plenty more where that came from . Oh , yeah ? How much more ? You help me get to my bank in the Cayman Islands without anymore hassles . [Walter_Graham] And you will be using that as pocket change . - You know somehow I do n't trust you , Mr . Graham . - [Graham_laughs] I would be disappointed if you did . But try son . [Gears_shifting] * [suspenseful_music] [Rachel] . - [Rachel] So . - [Martin] So ? It means that any food the cat comes into contact with becomes contaminated . Yeah but the food 's all locked up right
zone1	going to get awful hungry . What are you trying to say [Martin] ? [Martin] I 'm just saying that we got to stay alert . * [dramatic_music] [Suzanne] Mmmm ! [Voice] Meow ! Meow ! [Breathing_heavy] [Suzanne] No . Go away , please . Ai n't nothing here but us killer pussy cats ! You almost scared me to death ! Come on . What are you scared of a little cat ? You 're damn right I am . If you were smart , you would be too . You want me to stay here and protect you from the big , bad boogie man ? Matter fact , uh , I would feel better with a big , strong man here to protect me . [Sniffs] You know what ? I 'm going to do whatever it takes to keep him here . * [romantic_music] [Kissing_sounds] [Moans] [Kissing_sounds] Listen , if you really want to be protected , You 're going to be smart to stick by me no matter what happens . Why do you think I picked you from the beginning ? It 's obvious
zone1	. We are going places . I got it all worked out . Once we get off this boat , things are just going to slide ... [Kissing_sounds] [Sigh] You mean " if " . If we ever get off this boat . We will . If I have to row this damn thing back to shore , I 'm going to make things happen for me . [Laughs] [Moans] [Kissing_sounds] * [dramatic_music] [Martin] Two days stranded . Dammit , you 'd think we would find something out here . Okay . Let 's give it a try . See what we got . [Cranking_of_an_engine] [Cranking_of_an_engine] Dammit ! I just do n't have the parts . I just ca n't keep ... You 're doing the best you can . I never should have left port . You know listening to Graham was the stupidest thing I ... Nobody 's blaming you . * [light_music] You just got ta keep trying . Alright , [Martin] . I 'll be alright . [Sighs] [Sighs] [Sounds_of_wind_and_ocean] - I thought it was going to start this time . - Yeah . Me too
zone1	Really . Except for the damndest thing , lost all the feeling in my arm . Does n't hurt . Nothing . No feeling at all . [Lance] Kinda tingles you know like when your arm falls asleep . Uh huh . Well , I know something that will help . - [Lance] Yeah . - [Bobbie] Uh huh . This is just what the doctor ordered . * [romantic_music] [Kissing_sounds] - [laughs] - [Bobbie] What is it ? I was just thinking . You know I lost the feeling in my arm does n't seem to affect other parts of my body . [Laughs] Yeah . Let me take a look at that boo boo . * [dramatic_music] [Screams] [Indistinct_screams] No . No . - [Bobbie] Wait ! - No . You heard what [Martin] said , I 'm poison . - [Bobbie_screaming] - No . You heard what [Martin] said , I 'm poison . I 'm already dead . [Bobbie] Did you see that thing ! Did you see it ? Did you see that thing ! Did you see it ? It poisoned my blood !
zone1	got the poison in my blood ! Please do n't ! [Screams] - [Corey] No . Wait ! - [Bobbie] Do n't go ! - I got the poison in my blood ! - [Bobbie] Do n't please ! [Lance] ! No wait ! [Screams] [Splash_of_water] [Corey] [Lance] ! [Martin] I 'm going in too . [Splash_of_water] Can you see them ? * [dramatic_music] [Crackling_of_fire] [Rachel] Here . [Martin] Dammit . I ca n't believe what happened . It 's just not real . He was yelling about having poison in his blood . - There 's no more fresh water . How ' bout some champagne ? - [Corey] Yeah . Save that . We 've got to tighten up on supplies . We 're all going to die out here . I mean let 's face it . We 're all going to die on this stupid boat . [Martin] Easy [Suzanne] . We 're not going to die . We 're going to survive . [Rachel] He 's right [Suzanne] . We 're going to make it . We 'll have that engine fixed in no time
zone1	almost got it . [Martin] If we give up now , we might as well just lie down and die . [Martin] We 're going to get out of here if we just keep on fighting . You 're lying . You 're both lying ! We 're never going to get out of this alive . We 're all going to die . [Crying] That thing 's going to bite us . And we all are going to die a horrible death . [Cries] [Crashing_waves] [Martin] Any luck ? [Corey] No . Look , we need to let [Walter] Graham out . Never . [Corey] Look , we do n't have much of a choice . We need his help . Now what kind of help can he give us ? [Corey] He can give us plenty of help . Look , when you two are fixing the motor , we can form a counter assault team . You do n't know [Walter] Graham like I do . And I do n't like the idea of letting him out . No [Corey] is right . We are running out
zone1	anybody not pulling his weight . He and Graham can look for the cat and you and I can work on the boat around the clock . - We can have [Suzanne] keep watch . - Right . How 's that sound ? [Keys_jingling] - Alright , then . It 's settled . - [keys_jingling] Get away from me . I 'm not helping you with anything . You will take watch like you 're told . - No . - Listen you bitch ! If you had n't brought that cat ... [Martin] [Corey] ! Hold on . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . You want to get off this boat do n't you [Suzanne] ? - Yes . - We all do . Now we are going to . Everybody 's got ta help . Got ta do their job . You can understand that . Now we need you to keep a watch out for planes and ships . Okay ? You said it was good luck to bring a cat on board . That 's right . I did . And it 's your
zone1	right . You 're right . But I still need you to stand watch . Okay . [Suzanne] But I want [Corey] to know who 's at fault here . It 's okay . [Corey] knows . Do n't you [Corey] ? Yeah . Now come on and take the damn binoculars . I 'm going to go get Graham . - [Martin] Hey , [Corey] ! - Yeah . - [Martin] Be careful . - Yeah . Do n't worry about [Walter] , I can handle him . I meant the cat . [Corey] Do n't worry . I have it all figured out , Mr . Graham . [Walter_Graham] Yeah . There 's still a chance I can get to my bank on time . Listen , that thing can jump out from anywhere . Let me have the gun . Look son , do you trust me ? Do n't you ? Let me have the gun . Yeah . I trust you , Mr . Graham . Let 's nail this cat and I got some ideas . Yeah . This looks like a prime spot
zone1	and our little friend is history . [Walter_Graham] Just the smell of that stuff is making me salivate . [Corey] If you knew how much poison I put in it , you 'd lose your appetite really quick . [Corey_laughs] I 'll show [Martin] that he 's not the only smart one around here . After all ... The hunt is still the hunt . I do n't know [Martin] . Maybe you are right . [Rachel] If I could just hold out , I should be able to get that engine running . Yeah if the food will last that long . Here 's your turn to serve dinner . Cereal again ! Um . Mmm . Will you be joining us ? No . I have a previous engagement to become a master mechanic . Well maybe I can interest you in a midnight snack . [Kissing] [Corn_Flakes_hitting_dish] [Corn_Flakes_hitting_dish] That 's it ? What kind of food is this ? - Where 's [Corey] ? - He 's out checking his traps . Oh , I hope he 's caught that thing . I ca n't sleep with
zone1	dead cat . * [suspenseful_music] [Corey] The cat knows the food 's poisoned . [Cocks_gun] [Screams] [Gunfire] [Explosion] [Screams] [Moaning] [Splash_in_water] [Squeaking] What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Something I should have done days ago . You wo n't last two days in that life boat . Our only chance is to stay on this ship and get it going . And maybe someone will spot us . [Fist_pounding_wall] * [dramatic_piano_music] How the hell that thing get in here ? It 's lined with metal . I do n't know . How 'd you let that happen ? You were supposed to be in charge of the food . We did n't let anything happen . You 've been sitting around on your ass the whole damn time . We 've been working on the engine , the food and everything . [Martin] I assume it pried through the sheet metal by itself with its own paws . Oh , god who cares . [Sighs] Now we do n't have any food left . Cat should be satisfied now with the contaminated food and water .
zone1	shape than we are . We 're all going to die anyways . * [tense_music] - [Martin] What the hell you doing ... - [screams] I 'm looking for something to eat . I 'm starving to death . - [Suzanne] . Everything in here is contaminated . - [Suzanne_cries] What you say ? I do n't believe you . You and [Rachel] are just hoarding it all for yourselves . Do n't be ridiculous . [Suzanne] you 're going to have to pull yourself together . This food is poisonous . Poisonous ! Do you understand me ? [Martin] Everybody 's getting the same share of food . - [door_closes] - [Martin] That 's just the way it is . I 'm sorry , [Suzanne] . [Screams] Okay . I 'm going to the wheel . I 'm going to hit the ignition switch . When I do , just Pull that lever to left . Okay ? Okay . What are you doing sleeping ! What . What ! You 're sleeping ! You 're supposed to be keeping your eyes open . - Ohh . Ahh .
zone1	dead . I guess I should have known better . [Rachel] . If you have n't noticed . It 's all over . It does n't matter anymore . Nothing matters . Well you two may be ready to give up but I 'm not . Well at least you 're being consistent for being a dumb bitch ! You know all you had to do to get this boat back was to be nice to me .

zone1	3557370 One ! One ! One , two , one ! " Dear Mother . I hope you are keeping well ... and not worrying too much about me . You must n't think that any of us are going to be killed ... for they are collecting such a force here ... that an attack would be insane . The Massachusetts men passed through here this morning . How grand it is to meet the men from all the states , east and west ... ready to fight for their country ... as the old fellows did in the Revolution . But this time we must make it a whole country ... for all who live here , so that all can speak . Before this war began ... many of my regiment had never seen a Negro . Now the roads are choked with the dispossessed . We fight for men and women ... whose poetry is not yet written , but which will presently ... be as enviable and as renowned as any . Last night we heard of yet another defeat . But we are not disheartened . I am honored to be part of such
zone1	of which I am enormously proud . You would think it strange to see me giving orders to a hundred men ... most of whom are older than I am . Thank you for sending my volume of Emerson . His words come home to me like truth ... ' A deep man , ' he says , ' believes that the evil eye can wither ... that the heart 's blessing can heal ... and that love can overcome all odds . ' My dearest love to Father . Your son , Robert . " Charge ! Company , forward ! Charge ! Company , forward ! - Charge ! - Fire ! Fire ! Aim ! Fire ! Stand . Fire ! Steady , boys ! - Forward ! - Fire ! Forward , men ! For God 's sake , come on ! Robert , come on ! We must fall back ! No ! Forbes ! Forbes ! Charge ! Fire ! You all right there , Captain ? Please ! Not my leg ! - Where 's the chloroform ? - Stop ! Stop !
zone1	! So it 's your neck ? The surgeons are busy , but I 'll fix you up . - Let me know if I hurt you . - Stop ! Ah , this is nothing . - Heard the latest ? - What 's that ? I heard it from a friend who 's a dispatch rider ... who got it from one of Stanton 's clerks in the War Office . He says Lincoln is gon na issue an emancipation proclamation . Gon na free the slaves . - What ? - Maybe not in the border states ... but he will free some , anyway . My God . He said he would have done it sooner , only he was waiting for a big vicfory ... which is , I guess , what this is . Oh , my God ! Please do n't cut anymore , please ! Please ! This might hurt you , Captain . I 'm sorry . Dashing . - Robert . - Thomas . Captain Shaw . I was so proud when I heard . They had no choice .
zone1	? - Impossible , as always . He 's here somewhere . How about you ? Working for your father , helping him with the resettlement ... for the Freedmen 's Relief Association . There 's a shortage of housing . Robert ! Are you all right ? Yes . I 'm sorry . Darling , there 's someone who wishes to meet you . General Hunter rounded up a bunch of slaves ... called them contraband and put them in camps like cattle . The War Department decided to issue them pikes rather than guns . Ot course they deserted . So would I . Robert . Governor , you know my son Robert . - Good to see you again . - Governor Andrew . Robert , have you met Frederick Douglass ? Mr . Douglass . I understand you were at Antietam . A great and a terrible day . I could use your help . The governor is proposing to raise a regiment of Negro soldiers . No . It was not just my idea . Mr . Douglass ... We will offer pride and dignity
zone1	Colored soldiers . Just think of it . - Wonderful . I 've submitted your name to be commissioned colonel ... of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry . Thank you , Governor . That 's ... It 's a wondertul idea . Excuse me . Well done , Shaw . - Splendid job , young man . - Bravo , Robert . What 's the matter ? Too much punch ? I know how much you 'd like to make colonel , but a colored regiment ? You know how popular that would be ? Handing out guns to a thousand coloreds ? Hey , Robert . What 's wrong ? I 'm gon na do it . You 're not serious . - I want you to come with me . - Me ? And you ? Can you picture me in charge of a regiment ? Picture me in charge of anything . I would be honored to have you . Then you 're an idiot . Rob , is it true ? There 's to be a colored regiment ? So it seems . Then I am your
zone1	, Colonel ? We gon na whup the Secess ' ? When do we get the blue suit ? Yeah , the blue suit . Ready to whip them Rebs . When are we gon na get to fight ? Are we really gon na get to fight this time ? Attention ! Morning . Good morning , gentlemen . I am Colonel Robert Gould Shaw . I am your commanding officer . It is a great pleasure to see you all here today . It is my hope that the same courage ... spirit and honor ... which has brought us together ... will one day restore this Union . May God bless us all ! Form companies ? We will commence with forming companies . Company officers , take charge . You recruits will report to your respective officers ... by the letter of your company in alphabetical order ... which is in the top left-hand corner of your muster sheet . - Good book , brother ? - Yes , it is , actually .

Yes , sir ! Wait , no . That 's my space , nigger . I sleep better close by the door . I prefer a space with more reading light . Oh , I like it when niggers talk good as white folk . I 'd be happy to teach you . It would be my pleasure . Look , snowflake , I ai n't got nothing to learn from no house nigger . I am a free man , as was my father . Good . Move your free black ass before I bust it up . - Hey , hold up , buck . -
zone1	all right . I 'll be fine over here . - Mm-hmm . - Excuse me . Wonder when they gon na give us the blue suit . Ai n't no blue suit for the black soldiers . Blue suits for the whites . Well , we soldiers now . Where you from , field hand ? South Carolina . You ought to know better , boy . Hey , would you quit that ? Say , boy , quit that drumming . What 's your name ?

Major Forbes ! - A word , please . - Oh , excuse me , Thomas . Yes , Robert ? I wo n't permit that kind of fraternization . - It 's only Thomas . - He 's an enlisted man . You 're right , of course .

zone1	about the uniforms ? Still no word . Rifles ? See to it . You 're a big buck , are n't you ? You 've got a lot to learn ! You have n't had a master like me ! " Dear Mother . The men learn very quickly . Faster than white troops , it seems to me . They are almost grave and sedate under instruction ... and they restrain themselves . But the moment they are dismissed from drill ... every tongue is relaxed and every ivory tooth is visible ... and you would not know from the sound of it that this is an army camp . They must have learned this from long hours of meaningless , inhuman work ... to set their minds free so quickly . It gives them great energy . There is no doubt that we will leave this state ... as fine a regiment as any that has marched . As ever , your son , Robert . " They 've done it . Assemble the men . Attention ! Attention ! Battalion ! In accordance with President Lincoln
zone1	Confederate Congress has issued a proclamation . It reads : " Any Negro taken in arms ... against the Confederacy ... will immediately be returned to a state of slavery .

You 're up early . I want to talk to you . Certainly . If you would n't mind getting down from your horse . - Better ? - Why do you treat the men this way ? How should I treat them ? Like men ? And what about Thomas ? Why are you so hard on him ? He 's not a very good soldier . I 'm getting these men ready for battle . Robert , they 're already as good as the Seventh ever was . They march well . They 're disciplined . - No thanks to you . - I beg your pardon ? You heard me . Who do you think you are , acting the high-up colonel ? You seem to forget I know you and so does Thomas . If you do n't believe in what
zone1	part of it . Part of what ? Huh ? Left , right ! Little finger along the seams of your trousers ? Marching is probably all they 'll ever get to do , Robert . It is my job ... to get these men ready . And I will . They have risked their lives to be here . They have given up their freedom . I owe them as much as they have given . I owe them my freedom ... my life , if necessary . Maybe so do you , Cabot . I think you do . Develop ! En garde . Thrust ! Develop ! You 're not at dancing school ! Take his head off !

I guess the whole world hate the nigger . Boy , if you do n't quit that drumming in here ... Honey , why do n't you take your drum on outside and practice ? That Colonel Shaw , he a hard man . He a swell . Just a nigger-beating swell . But he in the same boat
zone1	kill him too . Huh . Not him . He a swell . He just a boy . He a weak white boy . Beating on a nigger make him feel strong . Ai n't that right , snowflake ? You know , he ai n't never been to no West Point . Onliest reason he in charge is ' cause his mommy and daddy fixed it . Ai n't that so ? You thought he was different , did n't you ? Hmm ? What you think now ? You just thought you was so smart , did n't you ? You in the real school now , though , ai n't you ? What you gon na do ? Cry ? Yeah . He sure enough learning now , ai n't he ?

If things continue to go badly , I wonder if I might not end my days ... as an outlaw leader of a band of fugitive slaves .

He would have told me he was retiring . - Why did n't he do that ? - To tell you the truth , he lost you . - He lost me ? - Yeah . That 's why we put him out to pasture , why I 'm on the case . Where is he ? Where did he retire to ? Where did he retire to ? He once gave me a number . His sister 's place in St . Louis . He used to go there on vacations . Is that where he is ? Am I getting warm ? He 's out of the picture . Are you in some kind of trouble ? Not at all . Where 's Sorenson ? Still safely in jail as far as I know . Nothing to worry about . He 's never getting out ! His partner ? - Diggs ? - Yeah . Unless he 's made another pass at you he 's probably got his

The drop in foreign sales reflects both the negative effect of the strengthening dollar and an upsurge in competitive production in Europe and Asia .

You always were an actor , were n't you , Rick ? - You pretended to be my friend . - I never did . - Then you turned on me . - I never agreed to help you kill . Still a do-gooder ? My friend , Mr . Diggs , is worried about that . I 've served my time , thanks to you , but he 's still under indictment . Seeing as you 're the only living witness that can put him behind bars ... What 's he got on you ? You still his flunky ? Are you some hero ? Hiding in a grease pit for 15 years ? I do n't think they 'll put up any monuments for you . Any last words ? What 's going on ? Get out of here ! Run for your damn life ! Watch out ! Help ! - Let me in ! - Rick , is that you ? Yeah , it 's me ! Let me in

I took the dove off with a sander . I really am anxious to hear this story . I need some bandages , antibiotic and some antiseptic . Get shot often ? Only twice before . Could you please help me ? Could you look at my butt ? You leave me at the altar . That was my state of mind at the time . You went off with Jamie to seek your fortune and you were coming back to marry me .

The one you married . - You remember him ? - You know I got married ? Yeah . Four months after I disappeared . That 's

His family made laundry detergent . - Cornwall Chemicals ? - No . Kitchen cleanser . Do n't kid yourself . They were getting rich off the war . The war ? Was that it ? You were dodging the draft ? Or were you too gutless to tell me you did n't want to marry me ? Are you all right ? Yeah . I just feel a little woozy . - I better call the doctor . - No doctors . Four Seasons Hotel . Is this the front desk ? Is there a pharmacy ? Yes , certainly . Please send up gauze pads , tape and hydrogen peroxide . - Right away , Miss Graves . - Thank you . All right . What 's going on ?

Rick Jarmin 's alive . - How 's it going ? - Any idea who did this ? Maybe . I got a phone tip from an eyewitness , said there was shooting and a blue Beemer racing away with a man and woman in it . - We 'll see what happens . - Sarge , better take a look at this . See you later . Here . Thanks a lot . I have a right to be rude . I left a message for him . I waited for it and ... He picked it up . What time was that ? I want to go above his head . Try it by name . Try Bowers . - Billy Ray Bowers . - No one by that name on our list . - No record of a Billy Ray Bowers ? - No , sir . - Try Jean-Pierre Fouret
zone1	. - No . - Carlson , Matthew . - No , sir . Try Jarmin , Richard . Rick Jarmin . See if anybody by that name exists . I 'm sorry , sir . Have a nice day . Something 's gone wrong . I do n't seem to exist anymore . Expecting someone ? I have a standing order for breakfast at 7:00 a.m . - What time is it ? - 6:48 . You got a gun ? Of course you do n't have a gun . - You got any kind of weapon ? - No . It 's my breakfast . Marianne , get dressed . Get dressed fast , please . Yeah , we can make it . What do you mean " we " ? I 'm not going out there ! Four attempts have been made on my life . If you open that door , you could end up dead . Listen to me . We are at the top of a veritable fortress . Yes ! Presidents , oil sheiks stay here . Friends of Lee lacocca stay here
zone1	has the best security money can buy . Do n't be paranoid . I hate to be an old woman , but paranoid keeps me alive . This guy comes every morning . Trust me . - Got your breakfast , Miss Graves . - What did you order ? - What did you order ? - I ordered grapefruit , croissant ... And what ? Prunes . Ask him what he 's got . - Go on , ask him . Bet he ca n't tell you . - What 's for breakfast ? Some kind of breads and fruits . I 'll be right there . Rick , pull up a chair , sit down . I 'll share my prunes and then you can tell me all about this . Do n't take the chain off the door . Rattle it like you 'll take it off . Make him think you 'll take it off . You mean like this ? Is that good ? Yeah . It 's funny to you . Oh , God ! - Get the mace ! - You get it
zone1	- Come on ! Upstairs ! - Wait a minute ! Get my purse . - Hurry up ! - I ca n't do this , Rick . What are you talking about ? This is what Lee lacocca does . I 'm very scared , Rick . Since when did you start wearing underpants ? Do I get to know what 's going on or do I get killed for old time 's sake ? Follow me . - I 've got to know what 's going on . - So do I . I 'm supposedly being protected by the federal government but I think they 're trying to do me in . - Who are those men ? - Ex drug-enforcement agents . I sent one to jail and could send the other . They want me and whoever 's with me . - Why ? - I testified against them . That 's why . - About what ? - It 's a long story . This is not a good time to talk about this . Help ! My God ! Is that the VIP
zone1	? I 'm so hungry ! We got to get out of this room . - It 's too dangerous to go to the room . - I 've got ta change my clothes . No ! We 'll buy some , okay ? If this is n't a dream , I 'm in deep shit . - You owe me an explanation . - Get me out , I 'll tell you everything . No . Do n't tell me . No keys . Gotcha ! - I ought to weenie-whip you ! - Get that weenie out of my face ! Let 's get outta here . - How you doing over there ? - Great . Tell me the story . Remember when Jamie and I got everybody to chip in so we could go south and score some real Acapulco gold ? I remember you borrowed his father 's plane so you could fly to Mexicali . That 's the last I ever heard from you . It seemed simple . Fly south , pick up a couple of keys . But no , we were
zone1	off at the mouth and before we knew it there was this guy called Sorenson involved . - Things just got a whole lot bigger . - What a dumb-ass thing to do . - You always did love being a big shot . - You do n't understand . I understand . You were being a couple of jerks like always . Anything for a kick . Anything to thumb your nose at authority . Your gold card . Where do you get off with that attitude ? " Rick Jarmin , asshole . " - Whatever happened to you ? - I got smart . Is that what you call being corrupted ? " Smart ? " - You know nothing about me . - I got your number , baby . We got a blue Beemer . You 're totally unchanged . I 've never met anybody more holier-than-thou . Tell me something honestly . Do you ever donate anything to the poor ? Or do you and Jerry the Napalm King hoard your millions ? - Laundry detergent ! - Yeah , we had it wrong
zone1	our millions . Occasionally we invite a poor person in for Thanksgiving . Feed him nothing . We eat turkey in front of him and watch him starve . - Can I drop you somewhere ? - Yeah . Wisconsin . - Wisconsin ? - Yeah . Racine , Wisconsin . I 've got to find Lou Baird . He 's the one I can trust to get me back into hiding . - What 's he doing in Wisconsin ? - He 's not . He 's in St . Louis . I 'm with Rick Jarmin again . The hand is quicker than the eye . My address book is in Wisconsin . His sister is there , and I think that 's where he retired . I do n't think you 're in any witness-relocation program . You 're some two-bit criminal being chased by the police . - You do n't mean that . - Or you ca n't pay your gambling debts . - You dressed it up with this FBI crap . - Wisconsin is only six hours away . - I have a
zone1	'm expected home . - Hands on the dashboard . Do n't move . - Get that gun out of my face . - You have the right to an attorney . I am an attorney , damn it ! - Are you Billy Ray Bowers ? - What 's he charged with ? You 're both charged with the killing of Marvin Marsent . You were identified at the scene of the crime . Rick , tell them . - What ? - About the witness relocation program . - You 'll have time to tell us in jail . - Put both hands behind your head . Drive ! Get in the car ! Shut up and steer the damn thing ! - Did you kill the guy ? - No , I loved him . They killed him . Then you can plead innocent ! I never will . They 'll kill me before I get a chance . The same goes for you . Get your foot off ! Shit ! Oh , God ! You 're gon na break my legs ! Stop squealing !
zone1	as you can . Get your face off my gas ! Shit ! This ca n't be good for you . - What are you doing ? - I 'm taking your place . Move over . This is a rented car . We can get in trouble if you drive it . - You 're worried about Hertz ? Move ! - Give me my wheel ! You 'll get us both killed . Move over ! Jesus ! - I think we lost them . - Where are we ? They 're not there anymore . - We 're in the railway tunnel . - Where the hell are we ? Shit ! Back up ! I do n't know . Stuck . Goddamn ! What are you doing ? You almost got us killed ! I did you a favor . Are you having fun or something ? I ca n't believe when you pulled ... You were great back there . I was so scared ! You 'll love it in Racine . It 's a happening town . The car was rented by Marianne Graves
zone1	involved , I do n't know , but I do n't like it . Call it kidnapping . He 'll kill her the same way he killed his boss at the gas station . I do n't like all this killing . Erasing a witness ... You 're not trying to back out on us , are you ? Not a good idea , Joe . Please do n't smoke . We would hate to inform authorities that 20 years ago you were responsible for selling confiscated narcotics out of the back door of the police warehouse . Yeah , Joe . Especially now that you 've got yourself such a big career . Relax . I 'm doing everything I can . I 've used the kidnapping to bring the FBI in . We 're plugged into the woman 's phone lines , credit cards , bank account . Auto club . They 're bound to surface . When they do , Jarmin will either be shot or wind up in prison . Then he 's yours . We 're looking forward to that , Joe . What a
zone1	Where are we now ? Shortcut . What 's the matter ? Nothing . I never told you , Jamie 's dead . God ! He was killed by Sorenson and Diggs . They were two drug enforcement agents , corrupt one's . They busted Jamie and me for the nickel bags we bought and told us we 'd rot injail if we did n't do exactly what they said . One minute we were kids and the next we were trapped in the middle of a major drug deal . They needed our plane . They made us fly under the radar to an unmarked airstrip on the US side and that 's where all hell broke loose . Diggs and Sorenson must 've been under government surveillance ' cause there were a lot of cops waiting for us when we landed . Sorenson came out shooting . He killed one of the border patrol guys . He wounded another one . Diggs , however , got away . Me and Jamie figured we could bring Sorenson down before he killed anybody else . We were wrong . Jamie
zone1	three months in a Mexicali jail before the FBI finally offered me immunity for testifying against Diggs and Sorenson . That 's when I joined the Witness Relocation Program . It 's been fun ever since . Why did n't you call me ? I did n't want to get you involved . You were about to march up to the altar anyway , so I let it lie . This is it ? I think this is it . It 's all changed around . Yeah , this is it . It better be here or I 'm in deep shit . I 'm going to look for a bathroom . Have any change so I can get to the VA hospital ? Hold up . - Be right with you , pal . - What do you need ? - What 've you got ? - What are you doing ? That 's all you 've got . Here , brother . - Have three squares on me . - This all you 've got ? - How dare you do a thing like that ! - The

Emergency . - This was an emergency . - But it was n't my emergency . It 's that attitude that keeps half the people in this world starving . I do n't see you feeding the poor ! What did you just see ? You 're such a jackass ! Am I ? Mattie ? Mattie Carlson ? My God ! - Mattie ? - I 've got to talk to you . When I left my job here , I owed this guy a lot of money . Hi . You wo n't believe who 's here ! It 's Mad Mattie Carlson ! - Can you wait in the car ? Could get ugly . - Do n't tell me . I must talk to you . You were a hairdresser ? You do n't get a lot of choice in the relocation
zone1	gon na shit ! He 's gon na die ! I ca n't believe it ! Ca n't say hi to an old friend ? Cat got your tongue ? Say something ! Hi , Scotty . Hiya , babe . I ca n't believe you came back ! - How are you ? - Great . I like the ... That ? It 's just dirty . I had to tie it up . - Gorgeous . - Who 's this ? This is my sister . Hi . Come on . Let 's go see Raun . - He 's dying to see you ! - I 'll bet he is . Your brother is a genius ! Michelangelo of hair . I 'm not exaggerating ! We lost half our clientele when he left . He left on his lunch break . Can you believe it ? Bread and butter ! - Silly girl . - He always does my hair . Are you coming back ? You 'll have to pay Raun what you owe him . - Raun , look who 's back . -
zone1	bet you 're surprised to see me . You 've lost weight . Your hair ! You look 10 years younger ! Cut the crap . You 've been a bad boy . I know . Mea culpa . And sic semper tyrannis . You 're so right . But I 've come to pay you back what I owe you . Will wonders never cease ? - You still have my things , my address ... - Show me cash , I 'll show you the book . Could you hang on a minute ? - This is funny to you ? - Yes . I need $2,000 cash . Is n't it nice one of us became a materialistic being ? - Can you help me , please ? - What 's in it for me ? If I get the book , I can get to Lou Baird and pay you back quicker . If I do n't get the book , you might be stuck with me . How 's that ? Who do I make the check out to ? I 'm supposed to believe
zone1	The bank 's over there . - I 'll get the book ? We 'll discuss it when I see cash . And then I 'll want an apology . Then you can do my hair . - Why mess with perfection ? - Rick , it 's only fair ! - Who is this ? - His sister . - She called him Rick . - I called him sick . He is sick ! Cash . Apology . Hair .

What 's he like in the sack ? Can he thrill the lake ? I 'm not discussing sex with you tonight . I have n't had a girlfriend in five years . - Really ? - Yeah . Mr . Wiggly 's been on bread and water for five long years . - Is that the truth ? - Yeah . I did n't think it would be fair . You cold ? Not really
zone1	said you did n't remember . I feel kind of selfish under here . You are very selfish , and not just under there . - Too bad you said that . - Why ? I was actually beginning to get turned on . - Too bad for you . I wasn't . - You were n't ? - No . - Fine . Stop that , will you ? If you do that again ... You ca n't tell me what to do , okay ? I ca n't help it . What are you gon na do , add another felony to your list of crimes ? Go to sleep . I ca n't . What 's the name of this boyfriend ? Tell me . I 'll be nice . You will ? Okay . His name is Paul . Sounds like a dipshit . Anyone named Paul is probably a spot welder . Shut up . Go to sleep . - Is that true ? - What ? About five years ? - Thought you did n't want to discuss it . - I don't .
zone1	, I 'll shut up . God . Let me look at you . I missed you . God , I missed you . Does n't this feel right ? I had that dream again . Remember the dream I used to have after we made love ? The one about the Seven Dwarfs ? Remember the dream , we were in the middle of the ocean and it was that really big sailboat ? - Yeah . - We were alone . There was nobody around . It was just us . - That 's a nice dream . - Ca n't we do that ? Ca n't we find a way ? I 've spent 15 years looking for it .

We got ta go . - Hi . - You found me . Wait till you see what I got for you . - Bring it on out here . - There 's your watch . - What a beauty . - You think so ? Fine piece of equipment . Look at this little jewel here . I had to grind him down , but he finally accepted my terms . Hello . Extension 2200 , please . Hello ? Yes , Mr . Bernhardt . Of course I remember you . They 're headed where ? She wants federal marshals and some members of the press there .
zone1	can take care of all that . No , you wait by the phone . We 'll make sure she 's safe . You do n't have to worry . You bet . Thank you . All right . End of the line . Jesus , we 're overheating . We 're lucky to get here at all . Hang on . Wait for me . The lights are on , so I guess there must be somebody in there . Lou . - It 's me , Rick . - In a minute . Stubborn old guy , is n't he ? You mind if we come in ? I 'll see you at the front door . - Lou . - Yes ? It 's me , Rick Jarmin . My Lord . So it is . Jeez , Lou . Come on in . Hi . - This is Marianne Graves . - How do you do ? You scared the hell out of me . I thought you forgot who I was . I damn near did . I 'd be in big trouble then ,
zone1	about the only guy in the world who can help me out . Where do I start ? They finally let Sorenson out of the cage . He and Diggs are after us , and they seem to know every move we 're making . I think somebody at the Bureau is doing us in . I work at the zoo . - I 've got connections there . - You placed me there , remember ? It 's just down the block . I can find it every time , even in the dark . Molly likes it that way . Are you Monty ? I 'm sorry . I did n't hear the bell . Are you the young man who was calling ? I told you I did n't think he 'd remember . That 's why I thought you should come here . Sometimes it helps if he sees a face . Ma'am , do you know who that is ? Those are federal marshals . I called them . I thought this was a setup . Even if it is n't a setup , you
zone1	running ... You 're right about one thing . There 's nowhere else to run . - You have a basement here ? - It 's off the kitchen . - Can you show it to me ? - What have I done ? I 'm sorry . It 's designed as a bomb shelter . No one can get in here . Go and lock yourselves in . Do n't come out till it 's quiet . - Where are you going , Rick ? - I do n't know , Lou . How about the zoo ? They got guns there . - You know every inch of the way . - That 's a good idea . Zoo . Hello ? Hurry up ! You got nothing to fear . Joe Weyburn . - Are n't those guys gon na follow us ? - Damn well better . They 've changed the code . Not now ! - How did you ... ? - I ca n't believe I did that . - Come on . - Wait . You did n't see us , Bob ,

I 'm sorry I did this to you . I called them on you . That 's all right . I should be apologizing to you . It 's probably for the best . - Fifteen years is long enough . - Yeah , it is . Lock the doors and stay in here no matter what you see . Do n't come out . Just stay in here . If you see me do this , I want you to hit this button . See what it does ? See those lights there ?

zone1	7036483 All my life was like I was in prison or something . I kept tryin ' to break out , but that only got me deeper in what I was tryin ' to get away from . It 's like I 'm wading in quicksand . After what happened , I do n't expect people to feel sorry for me . I did what I had to do . That 's , that 's true anyway . It was just that everywhere I look people got things and I ai n't got nothing . So I just tried to even it out a little bit , that 's all . They have all the power . What did I have ? What I got now ? Nothin ' . I 'm just a goose egg . A zero . You really want to know the truth about it ? I ai n't shit . When the deal went down ... I was like a trapped panther . I could n't get out of it any way I tried . So ... I try to bring down everybody with me . I did n't mean to hurt that dude ...
zone1	act tough ... that 's my cover . I ai n't tough . I do n't even know how to love somebody without hurting them . God , please ... somebody ... Help me ! Please help me . Fuck !

Understand me ? Here . And get ready for school . I 'm outta here , man . Vince , where you going at this time of the morning ? To work . Vince , who you kidding ? You ai n't had no job in 2 years . Why do n't you go back to school , like Vicki and make something of yourself . We got to go over all this again , Mom ? Vince , I 'm just feeling kind of responsible for you . - Ai n't nothing else . - Yeah , I know that . - Vince ? - What now ? I need money . I just gave you some money yesterday , Ma . I spent it . I need some more . You
zone1	but you do n't mind spending it neither , do you ? I 'm still you 're mother , Vince . Do n't talk to me that way . I was 13 when I had Vince . Babies making babies . The day he was born I was in labour for 22 hours . I swore if the Lord let me get through this one I 'd never let another man put his thing up inside of me again . Then out he come . Feet first and so blue , I thought he was dead . When he comes in here , with all that money in his pocket , I knew right away what was going on . He ai n't got no job or nothing . Ai n't no woman going to give him no money . Not with that face he 's got . I suppose if I stop taking the money , he 'd stop stealing it . But what we gon na live on ? All them people in government ... Supposed to be so smart ... Seems they 'd know that people just
zone1	do n't let ' em they do troubled things to others , and to themselves too . That 's why Vince steals . You know it , and I know it . I ai n't trying to make no excuses for being a bad mother .

You know what I 'm saying ? Look at that ! It 's lovely , ai n't it ? Ai n't nothing like the fresh smell of pussy in the morning . All you got ta do is just hang out . The product sells itself .

You 're behaving like savages ! Vince ! You 're always fighting ! Why are you always fighting ? I quit teaching intracity kids shortly after that . In the cafeteria the other teachers would talk about the kids as though they were animals . When they were n't talking about the students they were discussing their condos and co-ops .

You know I ca n't do that , man . Why not ? I ca n't rap . I sure as hell ca n't dance . I hear you . Vince Williams was a bad boy . I always knew he would come to no good . He was rotten to the core . All our efforts to get through to him were useless . It just wound up making more work for everyone else . He used to organize younger boys and send them out to steal . When they got caught the courts would just let them go ... or have them spend a week or two in reform school . They were usually back on the streets within 24 hours stealing , and giving Vince 25 per cent of their take . One day I called him into my office . I asked him
zone1	he told me ? That 's the way big corporations operate , like General Motors , ai n't it ? They let someone else do the dirty work and then they keep all the profits . How are you supposed to reach a kid like that ... who does n't understand the uniqueness of our great free enterprise system ? S'up troop ? Yo , what 's up , trooper ? - How you living , man ? - Just got out ? Hey man , you do n't look too good , my brother . What the fuck did they do to you , man ? You need a doctor or somethin ' ?

There 's this guy from Golden Kitchens ... Comes into the bank every Friday . This fuckin ' guy is like clockwork , man , you could set your watch by him . He walks about three blocks back to his job . Now what you 're going to have to do is come into the bank ... Go over to one of the officers and ask ' em " How do I go about opening an account ? " Look for me , I 'll point the guy out to you . Then you take it from there . Say man , where the hell is Peppy at , man ? Yo man , he 's used to that small time shit . You know what I 'm sayin ' ? Give him a big job like this and he

Look , just in case . - Mike , I got to get back . - Yo , peace , man . Alright . What the fuck 's this all about , man ? Billy went down on some dumb shit like this . Take this motherfucker .

Fuck it , it 's off man . It 's off . Yo Vince , it 's fine , man . We 're talking about three Gs here . Ask him why , blood . Yo , man . We could go right now ! Man , right now . I said it 's off , motherfucker ! Alright ! ? Yo man

Though heaven knows I 've tried . You say it 's me who hurt you . I say it 's you . We have got to get together or baby we 're through . Y'know , the show was cool ... you know what I 'm saying ? I think it 's just ... Well , I do . - But that fat dude , his shit is weak . Well how did I do ? You sounded like shit . Why you want to put me down , Vince ? - Come on , damn baby , I was only kidding . - No , you was n't . You always doing this . Look . Look . Look . Look , I brought you something , baby . Woo , yeah , that 's my girl . You should n't
zone1	'm saying ? I was only fuckin ' with you . Vince ? So you want to know about Vince ? You know , a lot has happened since then . I got a new manager , I just signed a recording contract , I got a lot of stuff happening for me . All that other stuff seems like it was ages ago . Actually , it was a little more than a year . I 'd just started working the clubs . I 'd known Vince since high school . I was kinda wild back then . You know with the drinking and the cocaine . I do n't know whether I 'm still in love with Vince . Or if I was ever in love with Vince . I think of it as a mutual desperation . I had absolutely no self-confidence . And neither did Vince . I guess that 's why he was always putting me down . Well look what the wind blew in . Yo baby , what 's up ? How you been ? So ... How you been , baby ?
zone1	you try calling me and find out ? I 've been hustling , you know ? A man 's got ta make a living , right ? You ai n't been so busy you ca n't pick up a phone , Vince . Oh , come on baby , you know I love you , come on . For real , Vince ? Yes , for real . I brought you something . Something for me ? Come on Vince , you know I have n't done coke in weeks . Get me a beer . - Then can I have some ? - We 'll see . Go ahead . Go ahead . - Here , Vince . - Oh , thanks . Now can I have some coke ? Light me a cigarette . Come on , Vince , do n't tease me like this . Light me a cigarette . They 're in my jacket . Now can I have some . Okay , you can have some , right . All you got to do ... is lick my shoe . What ? ! Lick my
zone1	ai n't licking your shoe ! You ca n't treat me like that , like I was some dog or something . Lick it ! You know , you do n't respect me no kind of way . I do n't know how come I still see you . Get the fuck down there . Lick it ! Vince , you 're hurting me ! Look baby , all you got ta do is put your tongue out . Okay ? I do n't want to . Your shoe is dirty . Oh come one , you 've licked dirty things before now . That was different . - Why do I have to do this ? - Because I want you to . Come on . - Then can I have some coke ? - Yes . You did n't do it long enough ! Come on . If it 's anything I hate , it 's a bootlicker . Ouch ! Vince , you 're hurting me . Shut the fuck up . You like it , do n't you , do n't you ? Vince , you
zone1	you treat me so rough ? What you mean rough ? You know rough . Like you do n't care nothing about me . Come on baby , you know I love you now . I do n't know that when you treat me rough like you do , like I was some whore or something . Why do n't you treat me gentle ? You want somebody to treat you gentle , why do n't you make love to a woman ? Maybe I will someday . You a crazy girl . You know that ? I have to practice . Turn that shit back on , I was watchin ' . I 'm supposed to sing at Zappos tomorrow night . Turn it back on ! I was watching it ! I got to rehearse now , Vince . Get the fuck out the way . Rehearsin ' ai n't gon na help you you ca n't sing nohow . See ! Why do you always have to put me down ? Huh ? No . Do n't even answer that . Because by putting me down it
zone1	know that ai n't right , Vince . This is my home . You know what ? Ever since you got down with that singing shit , you 've been this serious fuckin ' trip . Then you go back to night school and boom , right away you got a fuckin ' attitude problem . What 's that all about , huh ? This is my ... So what , it 's your house ? So what if it is ? That 's what I thought . Vince , I do n't want to see you no more . You do n't want to see me , huh ? You do n't want to see me ? You telling me to leave , baby ? - Are you fuckin ' telling me to leave ? - Let me talk , please ! Okay , okay , you got the floor . Go ahead , talk . What you got to say ? You know , when you and I first met , we both liked the same kind of things . We was n't going nowhere . I did
zone1	But then something went down ... And I started changing . I decided that if I 'm ever going to be a singer , I have to do it now . I know I 'm still weak . I like to do a little coke . But not like I used to . Look baby , why you telling me all this shit ? It does n't mean a ... - It does n't mean anything . - Can I please finish ? Okay . You got the floor . What I 'm sayin ' is , I 'm changing my life . I know we ai n't no big time lovers or nothing . And all my friends say I 'm a fool for caring about you , Vince . But I do . That 's why it 's hard for me to tell you this . You know you suffocating ' me . You swallow me up . I feel like my life is being sucked into a big black pit . Vince , I got ta have out . What you take me for ? Some kinda
zone1	I 'm in love with you ? You got someone else , do n't you ? You got someone else filling ' your head with this shit ? ! Do n't tell me this shit .

Look at your fuckin ' self ! You be scheming all up and down Washington Heights ! Baby , you ai n't nothing but a common fuckin ' junkie . No , I 'm not ! No , I 'm not ! I stopped ! What ? What ?

Hey buddy , for $20 she 's yours . That 's alright , man , I got ta get back to work . Oh my
zone1	the fuckin ' matter with you ? Yo man , easy . C'm on . Get the fuck off me ! You 're fucking out of your mind ! What 's the matter with you ? Get the fuck off me , man ! He 's in the tunnel ! Where 'd he go ? Shit . Shit ! It 's history , man ! First time he was arrested , I was the arresting officer . He was a young kid around 10 or 11 . You know , typical story ... Stealing a baseball glove out of Woolworths . He was strictly small time , but he tried to look tough . I keep thinking . I can remember it as clear as if it was yesterday . There 's just something about this kid . I do n't know . If I could just think of some way to get next to him . Maybe we can save him . Even then you could see it coming . Yet there was nothing you could do about it ! Sometimes you just feel so goddam useless ! What
zone1	griefs to bear What a privilege to carry Everything to God in prayer We are here but a short time on this earth , then we are passed on . From dust we come and unto dust the Lord will deliver us . We know that it is God 's decision to take us when He will . And yet we can not help but ask ourselves ... Why did this terrible tragedy come to happen ? To William Moses . William was not a bad boy . In fact , when William was younger he even sang in the church choir . How then did he go wrong , like so many of our young people ? Why did he turn away from God , with such a bright future ahead of him ? And such a loving and dutiful mother . Only God knows the answer to those questions . Let us pray . Welcome William Moses , oh Lord ... Unto your holy bosom . For it was you , Lord Jesus Christ , who taught us that the good shepherd ... was sent to save the
zone1	Lord and Savior Jesus Christ ... who taught us if two ... or three , are gathered in your name , their prayers shall be granted them , Amen . Billy ! Billy ! Oh my God ! My poor boy ! He 's dead . Oh God Jesus . They put my poor boy into the ground . You ! You should be in there where my poor boy is . I do n't care ! It 's true ! You should be where my son is ! I wish you were dead ! Just a few more weary days and then I 'll fly away To a home on God 's celestial shore I 'll fly away You . So you read all this fucking shit , man ? Uhuh . Do n't touch me , motherfucker , not till I tell you to . Maybe we 'd be more comfortable in the other room ? That 's alright , I 'm fine right , right here . Well , here it is then . Do n't fucking touch me till I tell you to . You understand
zone1	? Do n't you ? Yeah , you like that . I can tell . I can see it in your eyes . You do n't have to hurt me . I 'm going to make it so nice for you . Get the fuck away from me ! Just give me the money , that 's all I want . I do n't have any money . What do you mean you do n't have any money ? I do n't have any money . I 'm broke . You mean you brought me all the way over here and you do n't have any fucking money ? You motherfucker ! You fucking faggot ! You do n't have mother_fucking money , man ? You fucking serious ? Are you fucking crazy ? Yeah , motherfucker . Faggot ! Excuse me ! Do you happen to have a light ? I believe I do . Give me your fucking money . That 's all I want . Freeze , you son of a bitch !

He 's crazy . I do n't care if he 's crazy or not . He laughing at me , I 'm gon na give him somethin ' to be crazy about . Do n't mind my laughter , my man . I 'm just a failed anarchist !

Do n't you understand everything you steal , every gold chain , every wrist watch ... You 're telling the world how valuable it is . Madison Avenue could n't even pay for a commercial like that . A walking ad from life . A walking ad from life ! Do n't you understand where I 'm coming from ? Do n't you know what I 'm talking about ? I know you better get outta my face , motherfucker ...

zone1	it , man . I guess you do n't understand . Besides , who 'd listen to a guy who ca n't even make a decent Molotov cocktail ? Long live socialism . What happened to the equality of man ? Calloway brought him to the Police League . He was a nice kid . You have to work with kids like this to understand them . He was real sensitive . So he covered it up by acting tough . But deep down inside , you could tell there was good stuff . With some of these kids who have talent ... playing sports can keep them out of trouble . Vince was n't that bad a boxer . Had a little luck in the Golden Gloves . But he could n't hit the side of a barn with a basketball . Let alone a basket . For kids like Vince ... they see only two things ... sports and music . That 's their passports out of the ghetto . That ai n't a whole lot of options . And if they do n't have outstanding talent in

zone1	the bathroom . Well , I know it should be in the bathroom , darling , but it 's not in the bathroom . Leo , honey , just because you 're going on television tomorrow , well , it does n't give you any right to be so snippy . It is not that that is making me snippy . It 's him . Him who ? Bob ? Yes , Bob ! Who else am I talking about ? Shh ! Quiet , he 'll hear you . Well , so what if he hears me ? It 's my house , is n't it ? Do n't you get it ? He faked suicide . Eh ? Is n't that a cry for help ? What is the matter with all of you ? Do n't you understand this man is crazy ? I mean , for all we know , the guy could be a - - uh , uh - - a mass murderer . Oh , come on , Leo . He 's a sweet guy . He 's perfectly harmless . Maybe a

Tourette 's syndrome . What 's tourette 's syndrome ? What 's tourette 's syndrome ? Oh , I 'm very proud of baby steps . Very encouraged by its success .

Lenny , let 's not shoot this fireplace . - Let 's set up over here and - - - oh ! Wait a minute ! Wait a minute
zone1	Marvin . We can still use the fireplace . You on one side and Bob on the other . I do n't think it 's such a good idea to have a patient on with me . - It is . - It is ? - Yeah , dad . - It 's a great idea . What better way to show the effectiveness of your book than have a patient on with you ? I think it 's a fireplace shot . May I speak to you outside for just one second ? Thank you so much . I worked very hard to get where I am . Do you understand me ? - Well , schooling alone , yes -- I do not want you on this show with me . Do you understand ? - I think I do - - now make up some excuse . Dr . Marvin , Bob , can we have you in here for a minute , please ? I ca n't . Dr . Marvin does n't want me . No ? No , get in there . They 're
zone1	In three , two , one . Marie grady in lake winnipesaukee , New Hampshire . And Marie , what is so special about lake winnipesaukee ? Well , Joan , among other things , it 's the summer home of Dr . Leo Marvin , author of the newest sensation in therapy , baby steps . And with Dr . Marvin is Bob Wiley , who is a patient and obviously a big fan of baby steps therapy . Good morning , Dr . Marvin , Bob . - Good morning . - Good morning . Now clearly , to come on national television live with a patient shows a remarkable amount of confidence in your meth - - ods . False alarm . Sorry . Okay ? Good . Now , Dr . Marvin , exactly how does baby steps work on someone like Bob ? Well , Joan , I 'm very proud of baby steps and enormously gratified by its success . I think the greatest challenge , aside from the writing , is finding ways to make the ideas within it accessible to laymen as
zone1	your impressions of baby steps ? Mashed potatoes and gravy , Marie . I could n't be happier about baby steps . I was a total disaster and now , because of this man , this morning I 'm on TV in front of , you know , millions and millions of people . I do n't even think Dr . Marvin knows what the heck 's going on . He ca n't believe what 's going on . I 'm very excited . You know , it sounds like a very intriguing process . How long have you been a patient of Dr . Marvin 's ? Um , three or four days . Three or four days ? Actually ... Book is not really meant to work that quickly . It only worked that quickly with boob . Bob . - You can call me " boob . " I do n't - - no , I do n't wan na call you " boob . " Even if you do it as an accident - - no , no , I really do n't want to call
zone1	you know , meant to work that quickly . But it did work that way . That 's the miracle of - - of baby steps is that it 's not just this book . It 's this man . It 's the compassion . It 's the dignity . It 's the wisdom . It 's the horse-sense of the guy that gets you and has turned me - - he actually had me stay here last night in his jammies . Using his toothbrush ... in his house . And I spent the day swimming and sailing with his family . Fay and Anna and Siggy , come here . Here 's the fam . The Marvins . This is Fay and Anna and Siggy , whom I went diving with yesterday and Dr . Marvin accidentally pushed me in . You have a very nice family . - Thank you . - Thank you . Thank u for coming . - Thank you . - Thank you . Thank you for coming . Marie , you 're wise . What do I say to someone who has
zone1	so much of their time and their vacation to make me better ? What I 'd really like to do is put the greatness of this man in perspective . I think there 's really only three names . Dr . Albert schweitzer , mother Teresa of Calcutta , probably , and Leo Marvin . The book is baby steps . The author is Dr . Leo Marvin . And we 've been talking with Bob Wiley . Pretty impressive stuff , Bob , Dr . Marvin . Back to you , Joan . Way to go , Bobby ! That was wonderful , Bob . Thank you very much , Marie . Can we come back in a few months and update your progress ? Uh ... As long as it 's okay with my doctor . What ? Oh , absolutely . That 's a very good idea . - Okay , great . Come on , dad , we 're taking a picture . - Come on , dad . - Come on , Dr . Marvin . Nah . Nah . No . No , you
zone1	planning on staying up here ? Just till labor day and then we all go on back to New York City . Okay , big smiles , everybody . All right , what 's the magic word ? Cheese ! Okay , bye-bye . - Good-bye , Marie . - Bye-bye . - Gon na miss you . - Bye . Bye-bye . It was nice having you . Bye , Howie . Bye , Marie . - Come again . - Bye . - They 're so nice . - You were great , Bob . - You really were . - You were incredible . I mean , dad choked , you saved him . It 's such a big day for the whole family . And here 's the one who made it happen . Dr . Leo Marvin . Dr . Leo Marvin . Get out . No , we wo n't get out . We wo n't . You deserve it . I mean get out ! Get out ! Is it something I said ? You 've ruined my life ! You 've ruined
zone1	've turned a perfectly peaceful house into an insane asylum . Get out ! - Daddy ! My God , Leo . What 's gotten into you ? It was a disaster , Fay ! No , it was n't . You were wonderful , sweetie . - You were fine , dad . - Yeah . Why did you need to kick Bob out of the house ? You think he 's gone ? He 's not gone . That 's the whole point . He 's never gone ! Is this some radical new therapy ? You see ? We ca n't be expected to understand him . He 's so far above us , we 're like ropes on the goodyear blimp . Are you all right ? I want to apologize to you for that terrible outburst . I 'm truly sorry . Call it a case of show-business nerves . Well , we can all certainly understand that . A lot of people freeze on TV , dad . Thank you . Bob , how would you feel about you and me having a little
zone1	, mm-hmm . I think I 'd like to spend a little time with you . Pay you back for all the time you spent with me . What do you say ? Feel like going for a little ride ? Do I ? This is so sweet . It 's really great of you , dad . It 's really nice . Look how happy he is . Try to be home by 7:00 . Where are we going ? Intensive psychotherapy . Whoa ! Okay . Some free associations from my infancy . A beach ball , a dog , a frog , a log , a poodle , a noodle , a doodle . Dr . Marvin to see Dr . tomsky . Dr . Leo Marvin . Main building , doctor . They 're expecting you . Hey , you 're Bob Wiley , are n't you ? Yeah . I saw you on TV . You were great . Ha ! Hello , Leo . Long time no see . Sorry I missed your show this morning . Well , is this the friend you
zone1	to meet your new pal , Dr . tomsky . Hello , Bob . New pal ? What 's wrong with my old pal ? Would you show Mr . Wiley to his room , please ? Oh , no , wait a second . Doctor you 're coming with , are n't you ? Fellas , I have convulsions . My bladder is feeling funny . Fellas ! Really appreciate you helping me out on this , Catherine . I can only hold him for 24 hours , Leo , without staff corroboration . I 'm not worried about that in the least . I 'm sure your entire staff will corroborate . Thank you . Thank you very much , Catherine . You 're welcome . Thank you . You see , Bob , I will not be defeated . I will negotiate and I will compromise . But defeat ? Ha , ha , ha . Uh-uh . Cigarette , Bob ? Oh , sorry . Did n't realize you were in a straitjacket . Honey , Catherine tomsky 's on the phone . Hello ? What
zone1	- Where 's Bob ? Son of a bitch ! Honey , where 's Bob ? What about Bob ? What about Bob ? What about Bob ? " Is it male or female ? " " It 's a female . What do you think , I 'm weird or something ? " But it reminds me of my favorite poem , which is , roses are red , violets are blue , I 'm a schizophrenic and so am I . So the psychiatrist has a patient . He draws a circle and says , " what do you think of when you see this ? " He says , " sex . " That 's not the joke yet . Wait a second . He draws a picture of a tree and he said , " what do you think of that one ? " " Sex . " " All right . " And then he draws a picture of a car , a house . " Sex , sex , sex . " The doctor says , " you 're obsessed with sex . "
zone1	the one drawing all the dirty pictures . " I 'm giving you back your admitting form , Leo , to save you any embarrassment . - Embarrassment ? - Yeah . Catherine , you have been duped by a textbook narcissist . A brilliant sociopath . Brilliant enough to dupe my entire staff ? I doubt that . It 's perfectly natural for a patient to bond with his analyst . Oh , it 's not - - if you want to be rid of him , just tell him you wo n't treat him anymore . Catherine , that 's easy for you to say ! The man is human krazy glue . You should have never let him sleep in your pajamas , Leo . Oh , I ca n't believe that I 'm hearing this ! - Relax , Leo . - I 'm relaxed ! Take a vacation . I 'm on vacation ! Maybe you should check in here for a few days . Get a handle on things . It was an interesting morning , fruitful . But it lacked the intensity that
zone1	get one-on-one . We just got ta figure out a way to work around your schedule . Could we work afternoons ? 2:00 to 4:00 ? 3:00 to 5:00 ? Monday , Wednesday , Friday , Saturday and Sunday ? Are you saying you 'd rather work mornings ? Get out ! It 's a combustible relationship , is n't it ? Is it just you and me or is it you and everybody ? What is this ? Isolation therapy ? Ahoy ! Excuse me , officer , can you make sure he 's home by 7:00 ? Hey , did n't I see that guy on TV ? Certainly very shrewd , Bob . Really very shrewd . You stayed free and I wrecked my car . But it 's over , Bob ! Oh , damn . Son-of-a-bitching Bob ! I 'm home ! Fay ? We 're out here , sweetie . Surprise ! ? Happy Birthday to you ? ? Happy Birthday to you ? ? Happy Birthday , Leo Marvin ? ? Happy Birthday to you ? ? For he 's a jolly good
zone1	? ? Which nobody can deny ? ? Which nobody can deny ? ? Which nobody can deny ? Dad , what happened ? Dad ! Honey , you 're a mess . Are you all right ? Oh , yeah , yeah . I just had a little car trouble . Oh , on your birthday ? Mmm . Happy Birthday , Leo . Happy Birthday , Leo . Speech ! Sweetie , we have a great big surprise for you . Your sister Lily 's here from Chicago . Happy Birthday , Leo . Lily ! We 're all here for you , Dr . m . This is your night ! Do n't touch my sister ! Aah ! I 've never seen him like this , Phil . He 's been under a lot of stress , Fay . His book , his interview , which , frankly , did n't go so well . And his birthday . Exactly . It 's a lot to bite off all at once . The sedative 's probably taking effect . He should be sleeping now . Phil
zone1	, I think so . - How is he ? I 'm leaving a prescription for Prozac . Excuse me , Phil , but with these particular symptoms , is Prozac the right choice ? You think Prozac is a mistake ? With this kind of manic episode , I would think that librium might be a more effective management tool . You could be right . I 'll rewrite the prescription . Bob , why do you think Leo went after you like that ? I do n't know . He 's been tense today . But do n't worry , no matter how long it takes , I 'm going to stay on and help out the family . I 'll just be the daddy . You are such a good friend . Leo 's lucky to have you . Lily , honey . Thank you , sweetie . Oh , no problem . It 'll be all right . Good-bye . It 's been a real pleasure . - Keep me posted . - Okay . - Bye , aunt Lily . - Good night . -
zone1	- Bye , Lily . - Bye ... Bob . It 's so hard , Bob . But , now listen . We 're not defending Leo 's recent behavior in any way , so please do n't take this personally . No . But we 've been thinking that however irrational the reasons , Leo 's just so upset with you right now that ... We just think it would be best if you 're not here when he wakes up . Please ? It 's not the way I want it . Me either . Or me . You want me to go . I 'm sorry . Really ? Good-bye . Green-puking pissant . Later ... barf-breath douche-mouth . - Good-bye , Bob . - Good-bye , Anna . Take care of yourself . Okay and you take care of Leo . Just temporarily disconnected , that 's all . You know , I 've got ta tell you , I 've had the greatest vacation with y'all . Y'all ! I am country now ! Naw , too messy . No , no . Not painful
zone1	. He 's not downstairs . Let 's get in the car . Come on . Maybe he went for a walk . I think that 's a mass-murderer 's stunt . No one sees it coming then , snap ! Hello ? Oh , gosh ! Dr . Marvin ! Doctor ! Dr . Leo Marvin ! Dr . Marvin ! Dr . le -- Dr . Marvin ! Hello , Bob . What are you doing with the rifle ? - Leo ? - Get back ! Get back ! What are you doing with that ? Quick ! Quick ! - Daddy ? - Stand there ! - Dad ! - Dad ! Daddy , where are you ? - Leo ? - There goes the fam . Shh ! Be very quiet ! And do exactly as I say . Turn around . Now , move . What are we up to ? Death therapy , Bob . It 's a guaranteed cure . Wow , should I put my hands up ? Yes , that 's good . Do that . - Which way ?
zone1	. It 's so right that you and I have come together , is n't it , Dr . Marvin ? I know it was meant to be . - You think so , Bob ? Yes , because it 's time and I 'm ready . With Dr . carswell fensterwald , I was n't ready . With Dr . rosengay and pancheski , it was n't time . I certainly was n't ready for mallmerstien or Miller or hill . But with you , finally , I 'm ready . The only significant difference between those other guys and me , Bob , is that I 'm going to kill you . But if you shoot me ... Then our therapy will be over . I 'm not going to shoot you , Bob . I do n't think I could shoot anybody . I am going to blow you up . See , this is called black powder , Bob . One teaspoon of this stuff can blow up a tree stump . There we go . And how much is is ? 20 pounds ' worth
zone1	no other solution . You wo n't go away . I will . No , you wo n't . You 're just saying you will . Then after I do n't kill you , you 'll show up again and you 'll do something else to make everyone in my life think you 're wonderful and I 'm a schmuck . But I 'm not a schmuck , Bob , and I 'm not gon na let you breeze into town and take my family away from me just because you 're crazy enough to be fun . You 'll take care of Gil for me ? Yeah , do n't worry . I 'll feed him till he 's big and fat and then I 'll eat him , Bob ! You sure are convincing , Dr . m . This is tricky . What ? Oh , it 's terrible news , Fay . Well , he did try to commit suicide once before . Maybe we should have seen it coming . More fish , anyone ? I 'm all tied up . I 'm tied up
zone1	I 'm all tied up inside . Okay , I 'm all tied up inside . And these phony bombs mean that ... If I do n't ... Untie myself ... inside , the emotional knots , I 'm going to explode ! Yeah ! Oh , it 's so simple . Yet , so brilliant . Okay , Dr . m . I get it . Baby step ... Untie your knots . Free ! Free ! Free ! Dr . m . , you did it ! Free ! Dr . Marvin , Dr . Marvin ! You did it !

Richard Conte 's a machine gunner and he has his assistant who carries bullets and all that . Or he carries the machine gun . As they 're walkin ' down the road on to the next battle ... Richard Conte would be philosophizing about life and he 'd go , " Butt . " He never had any cigarettes , and his partner would always go ... And give him a cigarette . And somehow , the way Richard Conte would be walkin ' in the sun ... carrying ' a machine gun and go , " Butt , " it made me want to smoke . - I used to do it to my friends in the pool room . - Yeah ? I go ... " Butt . " They go , " Get the fuck outta here . Butt . " Speakin ' of movies , I was thinkin ' too , this is unrelated ... but I was watchin
zone1	there was some movie on . Why is it in every movie there 's a shootout ... and when they run out of bullets , they like " click , click . " They fling the gun away like it 's a disposable cigarette lighter . What 's up with that ? Guns cost a lot of money . Ca n't you reload it ? You know what I 'm saying ? They always like ... click . They throw the gun out . - That 's a good point . - Another thing in movies I think is really weird . Like war movies . Nazis in movies ? - Why do they always smoke in some weird way like this ? We have ways of making you talk , Auggie . Stop ! It 's like the threat of ... you know , burn torture . Or it 's like this . Yeah . We know who you are . We have seen what you 've done . The fucked up thing is like you go to Hollywood now ... they got us hooked on cigarettes , you
zone1	there now , you ca n't smoke anywhere . You light up after a meal in a restaurant . They come over . " I 'm sorry , sir . Smoking 's prohibited by law in restaurants . " What 's up with that ? They get you started , you know ? - A butt . - What happened to the one I just gave you ? I sent it home . They 're cutting down on the butts at home . A butt ! A match . Thanks . Pays to have friends . Yes , I 'm smoking cigarettes and many of my friends have died of it . On the other hand , while I am smoking cigarettes ... I am not downing a bottle of Scotch ... in 15 minutes . So looked at from that point of view , it 's a health tool . I ca n't remember the first time I had a cigarette . I can remember the first time I had a thing ... you would know ' cause you 're from Brooklyn , called a punk . Do you
zone1	piece of wood . It was a slim piece of wood , this big , dyed green ... with God knows what caked on it ... about three inches down all the way to the end . You lit it and pretended to smoke it . Of course you could n't inhale it because it 's solid wood . And you 'd walk around with it . It was called a punk . Am I right ? That I can remember . When that turned into an actual Marlboro ... uh , I honestly do n't recall . It 's ... It , along with most of my childhood memories , are not available to me . My childhood was so unpleasant that I absolutely do n't remember anything , I think ... before , uh , age 31 . - Tommy . - Yeah . Pete . - Pete ? Peter ? - Pete . - Pe-Peter Maloney ? - Peter Maloney ! - Oh , my God ! Oh , shit ! - Tommy ! Tommy ... - Come on . - Facimimimi . - No . Uh
zone1	who ? Fennili . Tommy Fennili . - You 're Peter Maloney , Midwood High . - Right . - Double A-plus in Algebra . - Yeah . You 're the guy that wiped out the curve . How you been ? - How you been ? - Good . Good . I 'm good , yeah . I went to Harvard . Got my B . A . At Harvard . Went to Yale . Got a Ph . D . In the disciplinary studies , philosophy and biology . - Whoa . - Yeah . So , what 're you ... This is your place ? - Uh , yeah , it 's my place . Yeah . Kinda . - Still in the neighborhood ? Yeah . I love the neighborhood , you know ? Hey , wow ! - You mind if I sit down ? Thanks . That 's great . - No , no , no . Sit down . My glasses ... represent probably the future of glasses ... for a certain segment of the population . I 've approached , uh ...
zone1	, and that was because ... Let me explain what the glasses are . The glasses only have lenses on top . We basically go out and we , and we survey people at random . And then we take their answers and funnel them into , into a philosophy basically ... that 'll help improve their life . I have ... Do you want to do a survey ? Can I ask you some questions ? - Who , me ? - ' Cause I have a quota ... and you 'd really be helping me out . - Right here ? - We can just ... We can do it here . S - Sure . Sure . I got nothin ' to lose . Why not ? Let 's do it . Do you believe in God , Tommy ? - Yeah , I believe in God . - Okay . Yeah . - Really ? - Well , do n't you ? I think there 's a god . And I 'm not it . Okay . Is there anyone you hate enough to want dead
zone1	... and the crime would n't be discovered , would you let them go ahead and do it ? L ... That 's a hard one . I do n't want anybody dead . - This is Pete , Tom . You can tell me . - All right . - Maybe , uh ... Maybe one guy , okay ? - One guy . There 's always that one fuckin ' guy , you know ? - That one fucking asshole . - One fuckin ' guy . One fuckin ' guy . That 's right . Okay . Do you look at your bowel movements before you flush the toilet ? - Oh , come on , Peter . - Just humor me . Look , come on . Is it ... whoa , a foot-long floater . You do n't even want to say good-bye to it . You give it a name , you know . All right . Yeah , I look . Who does n't look ? You look , right ? Abso-fuckin ' - lutely , I look . I went to a
zone1	... I could put binoculars right in ... Straight through my frames because there 's no lenses there . The space scientists were all huddled around me . " How can I get a pair of glasses like that ? How can I get a pair of glasses like that ? " Because they 're all standing there with those tacky little strings around their neck ... with glasses hanging or they 've got them on their bald heads . Or I 'll be in a restaurant , and when I go to read the menu I flip the lenses up . And people come over and say , " How can I get a pair of glasses that do that ? " So I saw what my future was . Th-That perhaps my future lay ... uh , in eyeglass frame manufacturing . Or being sponsored by a frame manufacturer . And I was gon na call it " Lou 's Views . " - Are you satisfied with the size and shape of your penis ? - Oh , cripe ! Peter , come on . That 's
zone1	These are not ... No one 's gon na know this is you . There 's no name . - Who 's gon na see this stuff ? - It just gets processed into a computer . - No . But who is ? - No . You 're not satisfied ? What is it ? Girth , no distance ? Distance , no girth ? No girth , no distance ? Between you and me ? No , I 'm ... The length is good ... the width is questionable , and I got a little ... It curves a little to the left . - You got a curved one ? - You know , it leans a little bit . A leaner . Okay . That counts in horseshoes . How much money would it take for you to eat a bowl of shit , Tom ? Hey ! I 'm gon na tell you somethin ' . That I wo n't do . Every man 's got his price , right , but not me . No , no . Not Tommy Fennili . - No
zone1	. - No shit for Tommy . It 's against my religion . What religion is that , Tom ? The religion of sanity , Peter . You should try it sometime . I belonged . They excommunicated me . Let me tell you something . In an insane society , the sane man must appear insane . San ... Okay . " Insanity is the logic of an accurate mind ... " - " Overtaxed . " - " Overtaxed " ! - Oliver Wendell Holmes . - Yeah , I heard that . Goddamn it , Tommy ! Goddamn it , thank you . One thing that you do get here in Brooklyn ... which I now know from having driven around the country and looked elsewhere for it ... you get plastic bags stuck in trees . And it really drives me nuts . It 's like a flag of chaos . A bag in a tree . It 's a symbol . It just ... And I used to see them and just ... They would bug me . And then one day I realized ,
zone1	tree . So a friend and I made a long bag snagger . For which we are currently applying for a patent , in fact ... because no one ever made something to take bags out of trees . And it works very well . It 's a long aluminum pole . And we can actually reach now almost , I would say , 50 plus feet . It 's fun . It 's exercise . It 's ... Holding a big pole up and stretching . We walk a fair amount . And it definitely makes things nice , you know . Improves the tree . This is your basic bag in a tree . This can be recorded on film . We know that it existed . And when you come back , it will be ... only an image on film ... because I will have taken it out . - Is this your mission in Brooklyn ? - I do n't consider it a mission . It 's more like a hobby . Something to do with my friends . It 's fun to do .
zone1	It used to be I would see a bag like that ... and just shrug and think , " Well , there 's that bag . " And now I see a bag and I think , " You 're comin ' out , pal . " Once there was a major league baseball team in Brooklyn . But that was a long time ago . Jackie Robinson , Brooklyn 's famed number 42 ... baseball 's first Negro in the major leagues ... continues to captivate fans nationwide with his daring play . Boy , when they moved the Dodgers out of Brooklyn ... I do n't believe there ever was a worse day . Maybe when the war was declared . But other than that , I do n't think that Brooklyn ever experienced a worse day ... than when they moved the Dodgers to California ... and the wrecking ball hit Ebbets Field . There was nothing like it . The stadium , the ball park ... was like a little old country club . The fans all knew each other , and the Dodgers ' Symphony
zone1	out ... played the trombone , the trumpet , the drums and generally made fools out of themselves . Everybody loved them and they did n't care . The ballplayers all lived in Brooklyn ! They were n't all from Brooklyn , but they lived on Bedford Avenue ... and they used to rent apartments right around the stadium , right around Ebbets Field . Everybody knew ' em in the neighborhood . " Hey , Duke Snider ! Jackie ! How 're you ? " You know , whatever . It was like a family thing . Now , no more baseball in Brooklyn . Hey , Auggie , it 's a lot of money . I 'd be crazy to turn it down . After 19 years , you 're just gon na walk away ? I ca n't believe it . It 's dollars and cents . The store 's been losing money for years . You know it as well as I do . But you 've got plenty of money , Vin . All those real estate deals out on the island . I mean
zone1	. Too late . We 're already in contract . Hmph . So the Brooklyn Cigar Company ... is gon na become a health food store ? Times change , Auggie . Tobacco 's out . Wheat germ 's in . You know , it may not be such a bad thing for you , either . I mean , uh , maybe it 's time you moved on too . I do n't wan na see you turn into an old man sitting behind that counter . Everybody has to grow old . What difference does it make where it happens ? No more free cigars , huh , Auggie ? You really should think this thing through before you ... let it happen , Vincent . I mean , sure . It 's a dinky , little nothing neighborhood store . But everybody comes in here . I mean , not just the smokers . The kids come in , the school kids for their candy . Old Mrs . McKinna comes in for her soap opera magazines . Crazy Louie for his cough drops . Frank Diaz
zone1	his crossword puzzles . I mean , the whole neighborhood comes in here . It 's a hangout . And it helps to keep the neighborhood together . Twenty blocks from here ... 12-year-old kids are shootin ' each other for their sneakers . I mean , you close this store and it 's one more nail in the coffin . You 'll be helpin ' to kill off this neighborhood . You 're trying to make me feel guilty . Is that what you 're doin ' ? No . I 'm just givin'you the facts . You can do what you want with them . That Auggie , he 's gon na drive me crazy . Just when I get the deal together , he comes in playin ' those fuckin ' violins . Brooklyn ! Hmph . Brooklyn . I 'm supposed to care about Brooklyn . I do n't even live in this shit hole of a town anymore . Hiya , Vinny . Jackie ! In the flesh , sport . Jackie , the greatest ballplayer of them all . I used to pray for
zone1	was the man that changed America , Vinny . And I did it all right here , in Brooklyn . Oh , they spat at me . Cursed me . Made my life a never-ending hell . And I was n't allowed to fight back . It takes its toll , being a martyr . I died when I was 53 years old , Vinny . Even younger than you are now . But I was a hell of a ballplayer , was n't I ? The best , Jackie . You were the best there was . Things changed after me . Not just for black people . For white people too . After me , well , white people and black people ... never looked at each other in the same old way anymore . And it all happened right here , in Brooklyn . Yeah , then they ... moved the team away . Almost broke my heart . What 'd they do a dumb thing like that for ? Dollars and cents , Vinny . Ebbets Field may be gone now ... but what happened there
zone1	counts , Vinny . Mind over matter . There are more important things in life than baseball . But , Brooklyn looks good . More or less the same it was the last time I saw it . And Prospect Park over there . Still as beautiful as ever . Say , Vinny , they do n't still make those Belgian waffles , do they ? Ah , man ! What I would n't give to sink my teeth into a Belgian waffle ! Two scoops of pistachio ice cream , some bananas on top . Hmph . Boy , do I miss those things . Belgian waffles , sure . They still make ' em . Just go down two blocks to the Cosmic Diner . Jackie , they 'll make you all the Belgian waffles you want . Thanks , sport . Do n't mind if I do . A day in Brooklyn just would n't be complete without stopping in for a Belgian waffle . Would it ? Every day 7,999 ... Belgian waffles are eaten in the restaurants of Brooklyn . The , the waffle culture
zone1	generally are made in huge batches , and then they 're eaten cold . They 're not a breakfast food . Uh , they 're like cookies or something , or raisin bread . They 're that kind of food . You eat them with coffee in the afternoon . The Belgian waffle as it 's known here , with great piles of strawberries and whipped cream ... is something that Belgians are never failed to be amazed by . I think Belgians kind of like Belgian waffles . But to them , Belgian waffles seem distinctly American . They 've got that big Hollywood overproduction to them , which Belgians ... It 's kind of foreign to Belgians to overdo things quite in that way . Cigarettes are sort of like a reminder of your mortality in a way . Like each puff is like a passing moment , a passing thought . You know , you smoke . Smoke disappears . It reminds you that to live is also to die somehow . I do n't know , I 'm gon na miss ' em . But anyway
zone1	! Shit . It 's out , man . Got a light ? Adios . Adios , amigo . Adios , " cigarrettos . ' L . S . Equals M . F . T . Loose stomach means full toilet . Or something like that . When we were kids , that 's what we used to say about Lucky Strikes . Yeah , there it is . What 'd I tell you ? I love this too . " It 's toasted . " Oh , boy . They sure do take us for a ride , huh ? - How 's it taste ? - Tastes great . There he goes . Thirty seconds over Tokyo . Bombs away . - Want a smoke ? - No , thanks . I quit . Ebbets Field , " Shrine of Flatbush , ' will make way for apartment houses . The old ball park , standing for nearly half a century , comes to the end of the trail . The stands where thousands once roared ... await another kind of wrecking crew . Home plate is dug
zone1	of Fame at Cooperstown . At the sad ceremony , Roy Campanella is surrounded by old Dodger players ... Tommy Holmes , Ralph Branca and Carl Erskine . They watch stoically for the demolition of their old playground . Now it 's play ball again ... but not the sort Dodger fans cheer . This time , Ebbets Field itself is struck out . Today is my birthday , and I 'm 18 now . Da-da-da-da da-da That 's so sweet . Nobody sung it to me yet . Brooklyn will take care of me tonight , though . If I go around my way and tell everybody today 's my birthday , they 'll celebrate . You 'll see fireworks , but they 'll be gunshots . And , um ... people 'll probably hit me with cakes and eggs and powder socks . That 's how they celebrate my birthday . I do n't get no cake and can eat it . I have to get it smashed in my face , and beat with a powder sock for a surprise party . Walk in my building '
zone1	me with a egg probably . Y'all have a nice day . - You too . Happy birthday . - All right . Thank you . Ay , Augusto . ! You make me so horny ! You make my tripas tremble . Ay , Augusto . ! You would be so wonderful ... if only you were different . That Auggie . That Auggie , he gon na drive me cuckoo ! First he say " yes " ... then he say " no . " Is " on " ... is " off . " Maybe some other time . But Ramon , you see , he do n't know some other time . He 's going to play at Freddie 's on the sixteenth . And now , Augusto say he 's too busy on the sixteenth . Ay . What gives around here , huh ? Is somebody deaf or something ? I talk myself blue in the face ! And still , it do n't do no good . Lock this door . - I want you to lock this . All right . -
zone1	want to talk to you . I do n't wan na say anything to you . - Um , if he comes to the door , do n't let him in . - Vinny ? - Yeah . Where 's the money ? I know he keeps money around here . - I count it ... - I know he 's got a secret stash besides what 's in here , right ? - No , no . - I 'm taking this too . - What 's the matter with you ? It 's only today 's receipts . What are you doing ? I 'm taking the money . I told you before . I 'm going to Las Vegas by myself . I asked him to go and he does n't wan na go , so I 'm going to go to Las Vegas . Not only am I going there for a visit , but I 'm going to go there ... and I might just fucking live there , you know what I mean ? - What happened ? - What happened ? I told

Because the last time I tried to talk to you ... you did n't have nothin ' to say to me , I have nothin ' to say to you . I have nothing to say to him . And you 're gon na tell him that for me . Nothing about your life is boring , right ? You 're just terribly excited about everything that you do ? You 're terribly excited about everything .

I know you do n't have that and I could do that . I , I could , um ... I could do that . Give me some of this . I could love you very well . Would you go to Las Vegas with me ? Jesus , Dot .

" It 's real simple , okay ? It goes like this , okay ? Step , step , cross , open , back , back , cha-cha-cha . It was n't my fault that things got out of hand .

zone1	white guy . He lived in Harlem , right ? So we dared the kid to go in . The kid , he had balls , right ? He goes in , but the guy already locked up the night 's receipts . But he had a little cash in his pocket . So the guy , he goes in , he hits the guy over the head with a bottle . He gets his little cash out of the guy 's pocket , leaves him on the floor for dead . The guy lives , of course . Kid 's ten years old . Goes home , all right ? His mother says , " Where 'd you get this money ? " She goes in his room next morning to wake him up , the money 's on the bureau . " Where 'd you get this money ? " He 's not gon na tell her where he got the money , okay ? She finds out the guy on the corner was robbed . She puts it together . She takes the kid , drags him
zone1	is there . His head 's bandaged . He 's doing his day 's business . She says , " Did my son rob you ? " The guy looks at the kid . " Yeah , I think it was him . But it 's okay , he 's ten years old , he 's young . I do n't care . " She says , " Well , he 's yours . What do you want to do with him ? " You want to send him to jail ? What do you want to do with him ? You want him to work for you ? What , what do you want ? " So he gives the kid a job . The kid sweeps up the store like Jimmy , every day . Then eventually he 's washing dishes . Then eventually he 's like cleaning tables . I run into this guy , all right , ten years later . I looked at him , I said , " What are you doin ' with yourself ? " He says , " You know the
zone1	joint ? That was when you were ten years old ! " He says , " I own the place . " The German guy died , left him the place ... and the guy is making money hand over fist . So you never know , right ? That 's your problem . I 'm a black man , and I got to sell fried chicken . That 's your problem , man . I got to be selling chicken . - That ai n't got nothing to do with my ... - That 's not the point . - I 'm trying to make it ... - The point is ... out of something really horrible , something really great happened . - You got some watermelon too ? - Come on . That 's not the point . - Okay , that was okay . That was ... - That could happen . Relax , I 'm jokin ' ! I got you . That 's good . Thank you . - Hey . - Black people got to stick together , black man . - I

Remember the $10 ? - You got a short memory . Remember the $10 I gave you ? - Yeah . - Whenever you can , you give it back to me , all right ? - Okay . Thanks a lot though . - He 's got a heart . - I bought some fried chicken with it . I got some good news , I got some bad news . The good news is that you 're all here . The bad news is I 'm gon na sing . Well I was gon na join the army when you turned me down But I was rejected so I headed for the river to drown Well , I 've reconsidered decided life should n't end ' Cause girls like you are a dime a dozen And I

Yeah , girls like you are a dime a dozen And I got a nickel to splurge - Why are you ... Why are you still smoking ? - I 'm not inhaling . - What does it do ? - Stand back , asshole .

To most people it looks like I 'm not doin ' a goddamn thing . Havin ' some coffee , right ? Smokin ' a cigar . Hangin ' out with Auggie . But ... they look at me . They tip their hat . " Good morning . How you doin ' ? " They look at you . What do they see ? They think you 're a mugger . Well , early in the mornin ' Or even when it 's late I call my baby on the phone up in the 718 And I think about the way that she does love me And I wish that she were n't so hot I talk on the phone a lot so people ca n't see that I 'm black . But I really believe that ... I 'm Sicilian . -
zone1	's good . You like it ? Do you believe me ? - I totally got it . - I ca n't get my shoulders out of my frickin ' ass here . Put them all together we got the same attitude Very necessary being rude That 's the Brooklyn mood It 's the place where it 's hard to shed a tear People are filled with little care , any sympathy you wo n't find it here That 's the same problem we had . ' Cause I 'm a black man you do n't think I can be Italian ! Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah Wish I knew how to say I had a friend . Man , he loved cigarettes so much ... he used to like set his alarm clock for the middle of the night . Like he 'd go to sleep . He 'd set it for four hours later , wake up , have a cigarette . Butt me . Last pack . Get your filthy hands off'em ! When I was a young man No bigger than this A chocolate

zone1	203601 There 's no other way . You 've got to give them the key to everything that 's yours . Otherwise , what 's the point ? And , for a while , I believed that 's the kind of love I had . Before I ever ran a casino , or got myself blown up ... Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper , I can tell you that . I was so good that whenever I bet , I could change the odds ... for every bookmaker in the country . I 'm serious , I had it down so cold ... that I was given paradise on earth . I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run , the Tangiers ... by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money ... $62,700,000 . I do n't know all the details . Nobody knew all the details , but it should 've been perfect . I mean , he had me , Nicky Santoro , his best friend , watching his ass ... and he had , Ginger , the woman he loved , on
zone1	it all up . It should 've been so sweet too . But it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us ... were ever given anything that fuckin ' valuable again . At that time , Vegas was a place where millions of suckers ... flew in every year on their own nickel ... and left behind about a billion dollars . But at night , you could n't see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas . But it 's in the desert where lots of the town 's problems are solved . Got a lot of holes in the desert ... and a lot of problems are buried in those holes . Except you got ta do it right . I mean , you got ta have the hole already dug ... before you show up with a package in the trunk . Otherwise , you 're talking about a half hour or 45 minutes of digging ' . And who knows who 's gon na be comin ' along in that time ? Before you know it , you got ta dig a
zone1	' night . Who could resist ? Anywhere else in the country I was a bookie , a gambler ... always lookin ' over my shoulder , hassled by cops , day and night . But here , I 'm Mr . Rothstein . I 'm not only legitimate , but running a casino . And that 's like selling people dreams for cash . I hired an old casino pal , Billy Sherbert , as my manager , and I went to work . ... the casino manager . And this is Ronnie , who takes care of the card room . For guys like me , Las Vegas washes away your sins . It 's like a morality car wash . It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples . And along with making us legit ... comes cash , tons of it . I mean , what do you think we 're doing out here in the middle of the desert ? It 's all this money . This is the end result of all the bright lights ... and the comp trips ,
zone1	and all the broads and all the booze . It 's all been arranged just for us to get your money . That 's the truth about Las Vegas . We 're the only winners . The players do n't stand a chance . And their cash flows from the tables ... to our boxes through the cage ... and into the most sacred room in the casino . The place where they add up all the money ... the holy of holies , the count room . - Now , this place was off-limits . - Verify 3,000 . Even I could n't get inside . But it was my job to keep it filled with cash . That 's for sure . They had so much fuckin ' money in there ... you could build a house out of stacks of hundred-dollar bills . And the best part was that upstairs ... - the board of directors did n't know what the fuck was going on . - Five thousand . I mean , to them everything looked on the up-and-up . Right ? Wrong . Verify 5,000
zone1	Five thousand . were all slipped in there to skim the joint dry . They 'd do short counts , they 'd lose fill slips . They 'd even take cash right out of the drop boxes . And it was up to this guy right here ... standin ' in front of about two million dollars ... to skim the cash off the top without anybody gettin ' wise ... - the IRS or anybody . - Verify 200 . Now , notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything . Somehow , somebody 's always lookin ' the other way . Now , look at these guys . They look busy , right ? They 're countin ' money . Who wants to bother them ? I mean , God forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal . Meanwhile , you 're in and you 're out . Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra C-note a week ... just to watch the door . It 's routine . Business as usual : in , out , hello , good-bye
zone1	Just another fat fuck walking ' out of the casino with a suitcase . Now that suitcase was goin ' straight to one place : Right to Kansas City , which was as close ... to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go ... without gettin ' themselves arrested . That suitcase was all ... the bosses ever wanted . - And they wanted it every month . - Hey , John , how was your ride ? Now this old Mormon fuck here ... he had to fly in with suitcases once a month , nice and easy . - Somethin ' smells good . - Yeah , they made us somethin ' to eat . The bosses would come from all over the place : Detroit , Cleveland , Milwaukee ... all over the Midwest . And they would meet in the back of this produce market in Kansas City . I mean , nobody even knew it . One of the guys made his mother do all the cooking ' . - Do you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano ? - Jerry Steriano ? Now
zone1	believe me ... these are the guys who secretly control Las Vegas . Mama , that man 's here again . Because they control the Teamsters Union . And that 's where you had to go if you wanted to borrow money to buy a casino . - Would you put in shrimp ? - I would . Here you are , gentlemen . Nobody got a Teamsters ' loan unless the guys in this room ... knew they were gon na get their little suitcases . Guys like this antique over here , out of Detroit . Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi , the outfit 's top boss . You got a round figure on it ? - Definitely the most important guy in this room . - About 20 pounds . - That 's around 700,000 . - Uh-huh , good . I know it 's a little early for Las Vegas ... but I do want to welcome the ladies and gentlemen of the gaming industry . As far as the world was concerned ... Andy Stone , the head of the Teamsters ' Pension Fund
zone1	a very auspicious occasion . - A powerful man . - Philip , if you would rise . He even played golf with the president . On behalf of the Teamsters ' Pension Fund ... - it is my pleasure to present to you ... - But Andy also took orders . And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green ... this check for $62,700,000 ... for the new Tangiers . he did what he was told . Now , here was the perfect front man . What the fuck else could he be ? He did n't know too much . He did n't want to know too much ... especially that the bosses made the Teamsters lend him the money . He wanted to believe the Teamsters ... gave him all that fuckin ' money ' cause he was smart . I know full well how much competition we have in this great city . And where they got Green from ? Who the fuck knows ? All I know is that Green was an Arizona real estate hustler ... who barely
zone1	his own fuckin ' check . And of course it was the bosses ' man ... Andy Stone , who gave all the orders . Not the chairman of the fuckin ' board , Philip Green . I understand . I understand . Now all they needed was ... somebody they could trust to run the casino . And who better than Ace ? I mean , he was already in Vegas a couple years ... and he had the fuckin ' place clocked . But typical Ace , give him a shot at runnin ' a casino ... and he tries to talk you out of it . I do n't know if I could do this even if I wanted to . The Gaming Commission would never give me a license . I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me . You do n't have to have a license to work in a casino . All you got ta do is apply for one . The state law says that you can work in a casino ... while they 're processing your application .
zone1	do find out ? Why would they want to find out ? We 're puttin ' a hundred million into this desert . Why would they want to lock us out ? They 'll never find out . All you got ta do is keep changing your job title . Like , uh , from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman . They take your application , they put it at the bottom of the pile . I know guys been workin ' there for 30 years , do n't have a license . It 's a tough proposition , Andy . You know if I did it , I 'd have to run it my way . You got it . I 'm serious , no interference . Nobody 's gon na interfere with your running the casino . I guarantee it . And that 's how they got Ace to take over . They wanted him because Ace ate , slept and breathed gambling . They worked out a real cute job title too ... Tangiers Public Relations Director . But the only thing he ever directed
zone1	he was 15 years old , and he always made money . But he did n't bet like you or me . You know , havin ' some fun with it , shit like that . Where the hell did you learn how to deal ? He bet like a fuckin ' brain surgeon . Place the checks properly . - That 's the way you do it . - Yes , sir . He had to know everything , this guy . He 'd find out the kind of inside stuff nobody else knew ... and that 's what he 'd put his money on . Even back home , years ago ... when we were first hanging ' out ... he 'd know if the quarterback was on coke ... I 'll take Columbia for 20 . - if his girlfriend was knocked up . - Twenty dimes on Columbia . He 'd get the wind velocity so he could judge the field goals . He even figured out the different bounce ... you got off the different kinds of wood they used ... on college basketball courts
zone1	this shit day and night . There was nothing about a game he was gon na bet that he did n't know . Ace got down at six . Get me down at six . Season after season ... the prick was the only guaranteed winner I ever knew . But he was so serious about it all ... that I do n't think he ever enjoyed himself . But that 's just the way he was . But back then , the bosses did n't give a fuck ... about whether he enjoyed himself or not . To them , he was a cash register . All they had to do was ring the bell and take money . Especially Remo ... who was a fuckin ' degenerate gambler who always lost ... Cazzo ! All those fuckin ' sweeps . - unless Ace made his bets . - Enough now ! Ace made more money for them on a weekend ... than I could do heisting joints for a month . Whatever Ace picked up on the street , he told Remo . I mean , fixed fights
zone1	point spreads . He told fuckin ' Remo everything . And to tell you the truth , I do n't blame him . - Hey ! - Keepin ' Remo happy with money ... was the greatest insurance policy in the world . Son of a bitch ! How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan ? Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi - - How the hell 'd you do it ? Well , that 's why they paid so well . You see ? Never tells me nothin ' . What do we got on for next week ? Well , it 's a little too early . I 'd say Thursday would be good . Is that all right ? - Okay , you 'll come by the house ? - I 'll come by . 7:00 . Good job , my boy . Keep it up ? Okay , Ace ? Hey , Nick . Vien acca . - I 'll be right out . - T'aggia parla . Nicky , see that guy ? Keep a good eye on him . He 's makin ' a lot of
zone1	making ' a lot of money for us , so keep a good eye on him . Not like your fuckin ' friends out there that - - without brains . - Okay ? - All right . - Mi raccomando . - Yeah . Want me to take this for you ? So now , on top of everything else ... I got ta make sure nobody fucks around with the golden Jew . Chase , couple of shooters for the ladies . Yeah , we made a great pair . I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected . The old men loved us , and why not ? - They all made money with us . - They paying ' ? - How did Nicky collect ? - They pay every week , like they 're supposed to . - Do n't ask . - And where the fuck is the money ? I do n't see any money . - Hi , Melissa , Heidi . - Hi , Sam . Who 's this guy ? - Get the fuck out of here .
zone1	was eight . Ace , tell him the line on the Bear game . - Eight . - If he do n't know , nobody knows . - Told you it was eight . - How come I laid nine ? ' Cause you 're a jag-off . - Excuse me . - What ? - Is this yours ? Your pen ? - Yeah , that 's my pen . Why ? No , it 's a nice pen . I just did n't know whose it was . I thought it was yours . I did n't want it to get lost . Well , thank you . Why do n't you take that fuckin ' pen ... and shove it up your ass , you fuckin ' jag-off . - Well , I was just offering you the -- - This fuckin ' assho -- Look out , Joe . Look out . What 's that ? You hear a little girl , Frankie ? Hear a little girl , Ace ? ls that a little fuckin ' girl ? What happened to the fuckin ' tough
zone1	his fuckin ' ass ? - Nicky , take it easy . Nicky , Nicky . While I was trying to figure out why the guy was saying ... what he was saying , Nicky just hit him . No matter how big a guy might be , Nicky would take him on . You beat Nicky with fists , he comes back with a bat . You beat him with a knife , he comes back with a gun . And if you beat him with a gun , you better kill him ... because he 'll keep coming back and back ... until one of you is dead . Listen , with me protecting ' Ace ... he made a fortune for the bosses . I mean , that 's what got him to Vegas . He was a money machine . A tremendous earner for these guys . As soon as he took over , he doubled the fuckin ' drop . With Ace , the casino never saw so much money . And the bosses , they could n't be happier . In Vegas , I
zone1	They were close to the , you know , good old boys . I mean , without us , these guys , they 'd still be shoveling mule shit . Ward , you 've got to keep a cleaner space . If you need Mr . Clean , page him , all right ? Wo n't happen again , Sam . - Mr . Rothstein . - Mr . Rothstein . Wo n't happen again , Mr . Rothstein . Is this guy just another dumb fucking white man , or what ? What 's the story ? - You need this guy . - Ca n't get rid of him ? He 's juiced in . He 's the County Commissioner 's cousin . I would n't give the bum a mop job . But still , I had no choice . I had to take care of them . These yokels ran the state . Thank you very much , Senator . - They passed the laws , they owned the courts . - Hi , Ace . Hey , I need a room . - I had
zone1	Room . coming through that place every week . - Help the Senator , get him whatever he wants . - Certainly . Why not make him happy ? ... the Presidential Suite . For politicians like our State Senator up there , everything was on the house . These guys won their comp life when they got elected ... so , hey , why not take advantage of it . Still , the politicians came cheap . We could handle them . It 's a whale like K.K . Ichikawa ... who plays $30,000 a hand in baccarat ... that 's the one you really got ta watch . He plays fast and big and he has the cash and the credit ... to turn out your lights . About a year ago he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the Cayman lslands . Downstairs he takes us for two million ... and upstairs he takes free soap , shampoo and towels . Another billionaire cheapskate who loved his free rooms ... free private jets and two million of our money . But we got him back .
zone1	the fritz . I do n't know what the hell went wrong . I 'm awfully sorry . I ca n't understand it . These mechanical things , you know they happen . Hey , but better here than up there , you know what I mean . Then he missed the commercial flights connecting with Japan . I ca n't believe that there 's a convention ; there 's no room . We got him back with a whole floor of rooms to himself . - I 'm sorry you missed your plane . - Glad to get to know you . Oh , no . No gambling . And once he was back , he played small . He bet 1,000 a hand , instead of his usual 30,000 a hand . ... to the bank with a natural lead over a five . But I knew the trick with whales like lchikawa ... was that they ca n't bet small for long . He did n't think of it as winning 10,000 ... he thought of it as losing 90,000 . So , he upped his bets
zone1	a million of his own cash . In the casino , the cardinal rule is to keep them playing ... and keep them coming back . The longer they play , the more they lose . In the end , we get it all In Vegas , everybody 's got ta watch everybody else . Six . All right , who 's gon na give me that ? Since the players are looking to beat the casino ... Each and every roll , all right . - the dealers are watching the players ... - Six . - Fake a six . - the boxmen are watching the dealers . the floormen are watching the boxmen ... the pit bosses are watching the floormen ... the shift bosses are watching the pit bosses ... the casino manager is watching the shift bosses ... I 'm watching the casino manager ... and the eye in the sky is watching us all . Plus , we had a dozen guys up there ... most of them ex-cheats , who knew every trick in the house . Yes ! - Very nice .
zone1	' good . Lookin ' good . Let 's go . This is for Ginger . Come on . Let me have a hundred on your hard ten . Hundred on your hard ten . Thank you . Here we go now . Yeeeow ! - Oh , I 'm sorry . - The dice -- Thank you very much . Thank you very much . - Thank you , sir . I appreciate it . - You were great . Thanks . Take care , Steve . Take chances , drive fast . This hundred is for you , love . Thanks for your time . - Come on . - What 's the matter ? What do you mean ? I made a lot of money for you , I want my cut . What money ? I 've seen you stealing from me . What money ? Look at the stack of chips . - I want my half . - I 've been watching you all night . - I want my money . - Your bag is full of fucking chips . - I did
zone1	Get lost ? Get lost ? Yes ! Yes ! - Well , how about that ? - Come on ! What a move . I fell in love right there . But in Vegas , for a girl like Ginger , love costs money . - Ginger 's mission in life was money . - I 'll be right back . - See you , Ginger . - Okay , thank you for asking . She was a queen around the casino . She brought in high rollers ... and helped them spread around a lot of money . - Hello . - Hey , Ginger . How you doing ? Great , and I have something for you . You got me covered ? - And you do . Thank you very much . - Take care of yourself . - I got some lucky pills for you , Andy . - Oh , yeah . Who did n't want Ginger ? She was one of the best known ... best liked and most respected hustlers in town . Smart hustlers like her could keep a guy awake
zone1	broke ... to the little woman and his bank examiners . Any change ? Oh , I hit a few games on the way back . But that was all bullshit . She just pocketed the cash . - How you doin ' tonight ? - Good . - How are you ? - Uh , beat . - Ginger had the hustlers code . - Take one for you . - Thank you . - She knew how to take care of people . And that 's what Vegas is all about . - Sixty-eight hundred . - Thanks . - It 's kickback city . - Have a good night . Thank you . You too . - She took care of the dealers ... - Hey , Mitch . pit bosses , floor managers ... but , mostly , she took care of the valet parkers ... the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything . Ginger took care of the parkers ... because they took care of the security guards ... - who took care of the metro cops , who let
zone1	- No problem . - You are a doll . The valet parking job was such a money-maker ... they had to pay off the hotel manager just to get the concession . But one thing I just could never understand ... was that she could have everything under control ... except for her old pimp boyfriend , Lester Diamond . Gin , you know I got other people in this , they got partners . I want you to understand that I am looking out for you ... in this thing , okay ? You 're gon na get yours back , and you 're gon na get back first , okay ? - All right , yeah . - Where you going ? Where are you ? You 're in that place . Where are you ? - I 'm here . - No , you 're not . Where are you ? Where are you ? I 'm always here for you . - You 're my woman . - I know . The Ginger I knew would n't even look at this creep . - Good
zone1	a card cheat ... a country club golf hustler , a scumbag . - Chasing dentists for a few bucks . - Careful . The guy was always broke . He always had a story . And somehow she could never turn him down . The way Ginger saw it , I guess , was that Lester was just an unlucky guy . Somebody had to take care of him . But nobody had to take care of Nicky . If you find any cash in there , we 'll whack it up with you . I mean , he took care of himself only too well . - That 's why every badge ... - I folded these things beautifully . - back home wanted to nail him . - I would appreciate a little respect . - Look at me , pal , I got ta live with her . - Jesus Christ . Even after a little vacation , they hassled him at the airport . I mean , Frank Marino was there to meet him , but so were the cops . This time they wanted
zone1	Antwerp . - Will you help me fold these ? They were ready to blame him for anything , no matter where it happened . - Put your things away . - And they were usually right . - Hold it , hold it . Here . - Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster . - And he did n't give a damn who knew it . - Come on , there we go . Look at this . Beautiful ! I mean , that 's what worried me . ' Cause it turns out , Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas . - All right , we 're clear . - There 's more . There 's a couple stuck in there . I know there 's more . - I 'm telling you , they 're out ! - Come on . Do n't get so defensive , it could be stuck in your hair . What 's that ? Huh , what 's that ? There 's no more . Thanks , hon . I could n't wait to get my hands on Vegas .
zone1	have a good time . They sent me out there to make sure that nobody fucked with Ace . And nobody interfered with the fuckin ' skim . - Hey . - Hey , how you doin ' ? Hey , Sammy . - Boy , look at this place , huh ? - Incredible . Welcome to Vegas . - Okay , Sammy . - Something , huh ? Ginger . Holy shit . What 've you been doing out here ? Honey , come here . This is Jennifer and Nick , they 're dear friends of mine . - Hi , Jennifer . - A pleasure . Okay , Sammy . After we ate , we left Jennifer and Ginger alone ... and we took a ride to talk . And then , he hit me with it . What do you think about me moving out here ? What 's the matter ? You got a problem with that ? - No , of course not . - You mean , I have your permission ? Sure , you have my permission . But I just
zone1	here , it 's no joke . You got ta keep a low profile . It 's not like back home . Right off the bat , they do n't like guys like us . And this sheriff 's a real cowboy . Even the coppers are n't afraid to bury people out in the desert here . I do n't care . I wan na get away from back home for a while . I 'm tired of that shit back there . Look at this place . It 's made of money . You know what the best part is ? Nobody 's gon na know what we 're doing . There 's nobody here to see us . Everybody 's back home . Nick , I got ta tell you . I got pinched twice for no reason . I really got ta be careful . I 'm running a licensed place , everything 's legit . Do n't worry about it . I 'm not gon na do anything . I 'm especially not gon na involve you in anything . Ace saw Vegas one way
zone1	'm comin ' ? - Of course . but I saw it another . I saw it as untouched . I mean , they had bookies , pimps ... and drug dealers I could shake down . Who the fuck were they gon na run to ? So I started gettin ' everybody in line . Best of all , for the first time in my life ... I figured out a way not to lose . Yeah , he had a foolproof scheme , all right . It was n't very scientific , but it worked . When he won , he collected ; when he lost , he told the bookies to go fuck themselves . What were they gon na do , muscle Nicky ? - Hey , how you doin ' ? - How you doin ' ? - You got that thing for me ? - What thing ? Oh , Nicky . I thought you was layin ' . No , no , I 'm takin ' . I was takin ' . - You sure ? - I 'm positive . - I
zone1	confused ? Maybe if I stick your fuckin ' face through this window ... you 'll get unconfused . - Gim me the fuckin ' money . - I 'm sorry , Nick . I did n't mean anything by it . That 's why you had it ready . You thought I was fuckin ' layin ' it ? - My fuckin ' head . - Smarten up . And now Nicholas Santoro will come up and tell us about our first president . George Washington was born -- But still , it was nice and quiet for a while . Ginger and I presented Nicky and Jennifer all over town ... like regular Ozzie and Harriets . Beautiful , you got a beautiful swing . Ace got my son , little Nicky , involved in Little League . Turned out to be one of the other coaches ... was a fuckin ' metro intelligence cop . But it did n't matter . It was all about the kids . He 's got ta realize that everything ca n't be a home run that he does . That 's
zone1	's the kind of kid he is . And Nicky being Nicky , he made his presence known . Especially at the casino , where he definitely did not work ... people got the message . Me , that 's why the bosses sent me out here . They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint . Like these two fuckin ' balloon heads over here . They were gon na try to bang us out of 200 fuckin ' grand ... - yeah , right , I 'm sure . - Hey ! How are you ? How are you ? What are you doing here ? I 'm over here now . - You 're over here ? - Yeah , I 'm over here with them . We 're waiting on Carmine . Yeah , we 're looking for Carmine . He was here before . He had a suitcase and then he left . - Carmine left ? - Carmine left ? He 's gone ? He 's not here ? Carmine 's out ? I think maybe he went
zone1	. Well , listen , good luck with the joint . - Ah , thanks , Eddie . - Yeah , lots of luck . - Yeah , good luck to you too . - Hey , they forgot to sign their papers . Yeah , they do n't need those anymore . Guys from other crews got away with a warning . Everybody else , watch out . Like these yokels here ... who never heard of Nicky or the bosses back home . ' Cause they 're the morons who give you the most trouble . Even after we 'd catch them , they 'd try sneaking back ... with beards and wigs and fake noses . You can spot these assholes by watching the way they bet . Like this guy , he 's betting ' lavender chips ... at 500 each with only one little problem ... he 's always guessed right . If he was n't so fuckin ' greedy , he 'd have been tougher to spot . But in the end , they 're all greedy . I saw that the dealer was
zone1	He just was n't protecting his hand . He was lifting his hole card way too high . Now , here 's this guy reading the dealer 's hole card ... and signaling his buddy at this table . And that 's just what these hustlers look for . They cruise from casino to casino looking for weak dealers ... the way lions look for weak antelope . Operator , this is Mr . R . Get me Armstrong and Friday over at pit two right away . BJ 19 , second base , the beard . Operator , I need Mr . Happy . Loud . Man down ! Go get medical . We got a cardiac arrest here . He 's fine , folks . Just give us some room , please . They never know what hit them . And if and when they do find out ... that they just got zapped by a cattle prod ... they wish they really did have a heart attack . Turns out this guy and his fuckin ' pals ... they were knocking this place dead for years .
zone1	Hey , hey , what are you doing ? There it is . That 's it . - Cheater 's justice . - Oh , God ! No , no , no ! I wanted everybody to know ... that things were changed around here . We had to make an example of these pricks ... that the party was over . I 'm just curious . I saw you shuffling your checks ... with your right hand . - Can you do that with both hands ? - No . - You ca n't do it with both hands ? - No , sir . Can you do it with your left hand ? Well , I never tried . - So , you 're a righty . - Yeah . Now you 're gon na have to learn with your left hand . - It 's 100 , 110 , I think . - Yes , it is . Okay . Hiya . That 's a lot of money to be counting out in public . Why do n't I take him ... over to the office and
zone1	way ... send over a nice bottle of champagne on ice . - Sure will . - Real special . - By the way , I 'm Billy Sherbert , casino manager . - Hi . - Having a good time ? - Yes . You want to count the money in privacy . I have a plane to catch to Cleveland . Can I get my winnings ? Look what they did to my hand , man . All right , I 'm gon na give you a choice : You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here . - What do you want ? - I just wan na get out of here . And do n't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around here . - I 'm sorry , I made a bad mistake . - You 're fuckin ' right you made a bad mistake . ' Cause if you come back here , and we catch either one of you ... we 're gon na break your heads , and you wo
zone1	' saw ? We 're gon na use it . You got it ? - Get out of here . - Thank you . Throw him in the alley and tell the cops he got hit by a car . Within no time , everything was set in place . We got rid of the freelance scamsters ... the per was way up , the gods were happy . And I decided to complicate my life . For a guy who likes sure things ... I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real long shot . We 're not gettin ' any younger . Do n't you think it 's time ? Are n't you gettin ' tired of all this shit ? What , are you trying to handicap me ? I 'm gon na do you one better . I 'm tryin ' to marry you . You wan na marry me ? I 'm serious . I wan na settle down . I want a family . You got the wrong girl , Sam . I know I 'd be a good
zone1	do n't know me . You 've known me two , three months . I 'm 43 years old . I do n't want to wait . I know you well enough to know that I really love you . And I ca n't think of anybody better to be with . And I do n't feel like waiting anymore . You know a lot of happily married people , Sam ? ' Cause I do n't . Yeah , I know all that . I care about you , okay . But I just do n't have those kind of feelings for you . I 'm sorry . I 'm not in love with you . - All right , all right . - Understand ? Sam , I 'm sorry . No , l-- I -- I mean-- I can grow . As long as there 's a mutual respect , that kind of thing can grow . I 'm realistic . I can accept that . What is love anyway ? It 's a mutual respect . It 's a devotion . It 's a caring from
zone1	up some kind of foundation ... based on that mutual respect ... I feel eventually you would care enough about me ... that I could live with that . If it does n't work out , does n't play out ... then what happens to me ? You know I 'm doing well now , and I 'm gon na do even better . And so whatever happens ... if it does n't work out between us ... I 'm gon na make sure you 're okay for the rest of your life . And if there are kids , especially ... I 'll take care of you better than you 'd ever imagine . What are you pitching me ? Just what I said , you 'll be set up ... for the rest of your life , that I can promise you . Want to take a chance ? When I married Ginger , I knew all the stories . But I did n't give a fuck . I 'm Sam Rothstein , I said . I can change her . It was typical Ace . He invited
zone1	'd show . Because he knew they all wanted somethin ' from him . With Ace , nobody ever got a free ride , even Ginger . With her , he still covered his bets . They had to have the baby before they could get married . He even made Jenny and me watch Amy for a few days ... when they went on their honeymoon . But I did n't mind , we loved the kid . Can you feel my eyes on you ? Can you feel me look into your heart ? Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach ? Can you feel me in you ? In your heart ? Do n't make me come there . Answer me . I love you . But , baby , do you know that I love you too ? - No , Lester . - Do you know that ? This is the best thing I can do for my life right now . That 's right . So it 's going to be okay . Promise ? I wish you all the luck
zone1	do . It 's the best thing you can do right now . I mean this . You have real security . Sweetheart , you 're gon na be situated just right , in Vegas . Come on . This is great for us . I 'm always gon na be here for you . I ai n't going no place . I 'm lookin ' at you right now . I 'm seein ' you for the very first time , right this minute . I can feel my heart click . I see you 14 years old . I see you the first second I ever saw you . I see you , long-legged little colt ... stupid braces on your teeth . - Okay , then . - Every time I ever see you , that 's what I see . Talk to you later . Bye . You all right ? Yeah . Why are you crying ? I 'm not crying . Maybe you should n't drink so much . I 'm okay , I just -- You just have to understand . I 've
zone1	just wanted to say good-bye . I just-- I do n't -- I think I have a right to do that . Okay ? It 's all right . That part of your life is over with . - Right ? - Yeah . You 're with me now . - Yeah . - Right ? Uh-huh . - You 're sure ? - Yeah . Yeah . - Let 's go . Let 's go back in . - Okay . Oh ! Tsk . It 's great . It 's great . It 's all my stuff . Oh , my God . You brought all my stuff ! I ca n't -- Try it on . It 's yours . You 're kidding . Oh , my God . What is it ? It 's chinchilla . Oh , it 's so soft . Nice , is n't it ? No one 's ever been so nice to me . Oh ! Oh , my God ! So , do you think it 's too much ... if I wear these all on the same day ?
zone1	promises or do I keep my promises ? So wonderful . The jewelry 's not so bad either . We should n't keep this in the house . We got ta put it in the bank . Come on . Can I keep this one in the house ? Pay attention to me . - What I 'm gon na tell you is very important . - Okay . All this stuff does n't mean anything . Money , this does n't mean anything without trust . I have to be able to trust you with my life . With over a million in cash and jewels ... tucked in a bank in Vegas , only for Ginger , she was secure and happy . She loved that shit . But a guy in my line of work has to have a lot of payoff cash around . Crooked cops and kidnappers , they do n't take checks . Need any help with that , Mr . Collins ? So I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank ... under the name of Mr . and Mrs
zone1	kidnapping money . And since I 'd either be in jail or locked in a closet ... . when I needed the money the most ... I gave Ginger the only key to the cash that could get me back alive . This is a signature card . So once she signs those papers , she 'll be the only person ... to have total access to the box , no one else , including myself ? That 's right . That 's the way you wanted it . Sam , let me ask you a question . You must really trust your wife . Yeah , sure I do . Why ? It 's good . It 's just unusual . Tell you the truth , so many of my clients do n't . With Ginger and the money in place , I felt covered . And to play it safe , I switched job titles again ... and made myself Food and Beverage Director . This way nobody would bother me about a license . I mean Vegas was like a dream for me . Trouble was ,
zone1	put money out on the street charging ' three points a week . - Do n't make us come lookin ' for you . - Juice to the fuckin ' dealers . You wo n't have to look for me . I appreciate it . Thanks , Nicky . They were degenerate gamblers , coke freaks . In no time I had half the dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket . Then , I started bustin ' out high-stakes poker players . It was so obvious . - All of Nicky 's half-assed mechanics were signal-happy . - I 'm gon na open for 500 . Signaling back and forth . Why you cryin ' with two loaves of bread under your arm ? Nicky thought nobody was watching him . But he was wrong . And I did n't want any of those agents near my place . - Four aces . - I ca n't believe this . If I did n't have bad luck , I would n't have any luck . I wished to God Nicky and his whole crew would just get lost .
zone1	and start a war ? Nicky 's a made guy , and I 'm not . I ca n't do that . Be careful . Gaming agents are all over the place . So I 'm lucky . I 'm not allowed to get lucky in this place ? You 've been lucky all week . They 're looking to nail you . Ace was so fuckin ' worried about his casino ... he forgot what we were doin ' out here in the first place . A million times I wanted to yell in his fuckin ' ear ... " This is Las Vegas . We 're supposed to be out here robbin ' ... you dumb fuckin ' hebe . " I do n't give a shit who he 's connected to . Tell him to take his fuckin ' feet off the table . What 's he think this is , a goddamned sawdust joint ? Sir , would you mind taking your feet off the table ? Yeah , I would mind . I 'm having a bad night . Fuckin ' asshole wo n't budge
zone1	Good . How are you ? Wan na do me a favor ? Take your feet off the table and put your shoes back on . Fuck you ! I want you to exit this guy off the premises ... and use his head to open the fucking door . Sir , you 're gon na have to leave . Wan na come with us outside ? Bullshit . I ai n't goin ' anywhere with you . - Bullshit . You 're outta here . - Fuck you ! You know who you 're fucking with ? Do you ? You fucking faggot ! Do you know who you 're fucking with ? Leave me alone ! - Come on ! - You guys are killing me ! Sure enough , an hour later , I get the call . Ace , what happened over there ? Did you know that guy was with me ? No , I did n't know that . But you know what he did ? I walked over to him politely , and he tells me to fuck myself . - Then he
zone1	threw that cocksucker out . - Hey , come here . You called my friend a faggot ? You tell him to fuck himself ? - Is that what you did ? Tell him to go fuck himself ? Come here . Come here . You go over there . You apologize . You better hope he lets you back in . If you get outta line again , I 'll smash your head so hard ... you wo n't be able to get that cowboy hat on . Fuckin ' hick . Sammy , listen . This guy obviously does n't know who he was talking to . He does n't know that we 're dear friends . I mean , he 's already very sorry . But if you could do me a favor and let him back in ... I swear he 'll never get out of line again . If he does it again , he 's out for good . I do n't care what it is , I 'll never let him in the place again . I 'm sorry about this , really
zone1	You took your boots off ? You put your feet on the table ? You shit-kickin ' , **27;2563;TOOLONG ' motherfucker , you ! You fuck me up over there , I 'll stick you in the desert . - Go over and apologize . - Nicky , I 'm sorry . You know , Ace could be a very touchy guy . Especially when he got bigger in town . Like when he hired that Jonathan and David and their tigers away from the Palace ... by building them a new stage and giving them a Rolls-Royce . But I 'll tell you , he knew how to bring in the crowds . He knew all the fuckin ' angles . He brought over the whole " Femme Fatale " show from Paris ... but he forgot how lazy them European dancing broads can get . He had to weigh ' em in once a week to make sure they did n't blow up like balloons . She 's still eight pounds over . - What 's the reason for this ? - Mr . Rothstein , sir .
zone1	eight pounds over ? I 'm trying to use respect . Mr . Rothstein is good enough for you . Well , sometimes when you put that pressure point on them -- All you do is give me answers . Just give me the right answer . I guess she 's frightened . If she does n't lose weight she may get fired . That 's right , she will get fired . Send her back to Paris -- - It 's been our policy -- - Just stop everything ! - This woman 's an institution . - That 's the problem . She 's lazy . Hey , I got ta give the guy credit . I mean , he does the most obvious thing . This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit . So why not take advantage , right ? So , he took bookie joints off the street ... and then opened them up inside the casino . Within a few years by doing all of this ... he had every casino on the strip trying to copy
zone1	's dedication to his job ... I soon had the best operation on the strip . You got ta watch yourself . There 's a lot of heat on you already . Why ? Somebody 's complaining ' ? I 'm hearing things from security . The sheriff 's lookin ' to put you in the Black Book . That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit . They got two names from the whole country ... and one of ' em is still AI Capone . If they put you in that book , you 're gon na be in trouble . You will not be able to walk into a casino . I 'm trying to make a living , that 's all . I 'm just tellin ' you . Do n't say I did n't warn you . All right . Mrs . Rothstein , straight ahead . Very nice . Thank you . For his hard work and dedication ... and the new life blood he has instilled in Las Vegas ... Sam has established himself as an indispensable member ... of the gaming community
zone1	it 's my pleasure to welcome Sam Rothstein ... to the Vegas Valley Country Club . Back home , they would 've put me in jail for what I 'm doing . But out here , they 're giving me awards . It is with great pleasure that I accept this certificate of appreciation ... for charitable donations to greater Las Vegas . Congratulations , sweetheart . Sam raised more than we 've ever raised before . But my greatest pleasure was watching my wife , Ginger , work the room . - They all loved her . How could you not love her ? She could be the most charming woman you ever saw . People loved to be around her . You 've got to bring Amy to Sasha 's birthday party . We 'd love to have you there . - Yes , okay . - Great . She made everybody feel good . Congratulations , Sam . Oh , thanks . - Hello , Mrs . Rothstein . How are you ? - Hi . You 're one of the most gorgeous women I 've ever
zone1	Rothstein . Thank you . Thanks for that compliment . He was a young kid from the casino . Nice kid . Bright boy . What balls on this fuckin ' kid ! The next day I fired him . Ginger had that effect on people . I think she even encouraged them . Do you wan na see this one ? Ahhhh ! Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much . - But as much as they loved her ... - Oh , fabulous ! they did n't know what really moved her . Look at this . Look at this . Daddy gave me this -- And with Ginger happy , I was able to concentrate on what I knew best . Loose machines are right back over there . What are they doin ' back there ? You ca n't even see ' em there . - Okay , I 'll -- - What about the progressives with the high jackpots ? - Well -- - These are our best machines . They bring all the action . - No wonder the
zone1	The action is in the front . Bring ' em up front . - All right , I will . Listen to me very carefully . There are three ways of doing things around here : the right way , the wrong way and the way that I do it . - You understand ? - I do understand that . I 'll get right on it . - And thank you . - Do n't thank me . Just do it . You 're the slots manager . I should n't have to tell you this . Dang , you are right , Mr . Rothstein . I am so sorry . So I ended up working - - what , 18-hour days . Ginger was the one who wound up enjoying the best of Vegas . Come with me , please . I have a better table for you . What did you say to that fucking jerk , anyway ? I told him I was Mrs . Sam Rothstein . Well , you might as well get something out of it . Well , it was n't
zone1	happen happened . Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas . And from then on , I could n't be seen talking to him anywhere in Vegas or near it . What the fuck is that supposed to mean ? " He will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas . And the casinos can be fined as much as $100,000 ... every time he shows up . " - You believe this shit ? - Yeah , I believe it . You got banned . " Because of notorious and unsavory reputation - - " Motherfucker ! Is there any way around this ? No , there 's no way . Let 's say , for instance ... I wan na go in a restaurant , which happens to be in the casino ... to get one of those sandwiches I like ? Forget it . You ca n't even set foot in the parking lot . That 's how serious it is . In other words , I 'm fucked ? In so many words , yes . It just did n't
zone1	it meant . Not being able to go into a casino is one thing ... but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent . I mean , you 're listed in there with AI Capone . But Nicky did n't care . I got ta do something . They ai n't gettin ' rid of me . They 're not gettin ' rid of me . I 'm stayin ' here . Fuck ' em . Fuck ' em . So , once they pulled that shit ... I started doin ' my own things nobody ever thought of doin ' . To keep an eye on things , I brought in my kid brother , Dominick , and some desperados ... and started knocking ' over high-rollers , casino bosses ... bookmakers - - anybody right here in town . I had a good fuckin ' crew goin ' for me , I 'll tell you that . I had Sal Fusco , a great second-story guy . Jack Hardy . He worked for a safe company before he did
zone1	. This guy can bypass any alarm for me . It was like old times . And I opened up my own jewelry store too , the " Gold Rush . " Sometimes I used to go along on a heist , just for the fun of it . But I did n't like the people I was rippin ' off looking at me ... so I used to turn their fuckin ' pictures around . - What 's takin ' so long ? - This is a motherfucker ! - It 's working . - Learn how to open these things so you do n't have to take ' em . Some of these stones got a lot of niggers in them . Tell Pepe if he 's switching stones on us , he better take a camel back to Nigeria . - Yeah ? - They 're in Penthouse K . - Check in alone ? - They checked in alone . - Are they out now ? - Yes . Do n't worry . - All right . Thanks . He had tipsters all over town .
zone1	Yeah , okay . - Valet parkers . - They 're just checking in now . Okay , I 'll tell him . - Pit bosses . - Room 1230 at the Scirocco . - 1230 . Right . - Secretaries . - Mint condition coins . - Mint condition ? All right . And they all got a piece of the score . Car 's coming . They were very careful . They always bypassed the alarms , or else ... if not , they 'd drill enough holes to knock through the walls with a sledgehammer . Nicky was grabbing everything he could . Nobody out there was expecting a guy like him . For Nicky , Las Vegas was the fucking wild west . I just got a shipment of diamonds from Israel . What the fuck they expect from me ? I had to earn , did n't I ? You know , this diamond has flaws in it . - There 's no flaws . - I 'm doing this for 25 years . You better clean your loupe , because there 's no flaws
zone1	send it to Palm Springs or Arizona , L.A . I had a couple of sand niggers out there . You know , Arabs . What , are you gon na have a fucking meeting here ? I know his language . Forty thousand dollars . The whole package . Twenty thousand . That 's my final offer . He suddenly talks English . Let 's talk Turkey here . Twenty-five thousand . I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault ... where I kept the choice stuff . I could n't leave it at the Gold Rush ... in case we got raided by the cops ... or if my crew got cute . I had the only key . Jennifer did n't give a fuck . She used to fall asleep on the couch watching TV . This stuff was all mine . I did n't send any of this back home . Actually , I could n't , because I was n't even supposed to be doin ' it . The bosses were making so much fucking money with the casinos ... that they did n't
zone1	gave all the guys in your crew a piece of that ? - I took care of everybody . - Yeah ? That 's why there was no real organized street stuff in Vegas before I came here . But how much cash could I bury in my closet ? You have to understand , and I 'm sure you do ... that in a venture of this kind ... you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss . So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark , Ace 's banker . You will try to push it through , wo n't you , Mr . Clark ? - Yes . - I 'm giving you 50,000 cash . Then I put some more money into legitimate places , like my restaurant . - Is that the last one ? - Yeah . I had my kid brother , Dominick , run it for me . Fuckers . - Here you go , guys . - All right . - Thanks a lot . - Yeah . Enjoy . Have a good
zone1	, Dom . - How ya doin ' ? Yeah , Nicky loved restaurants . He was a real restaurant buff . And over the years , he always made money with it . In Vegas , he had the Leaning Tower . It was a very popular spot . He had politicians , showgirls and movie stars hanging out all over the place . That show over at the Flamingo gets better and better . By the way , Sammy said , whenever you have a minute , give him a call . - Made a messenger out of you too , huh ? - Anything for a buck . - He does it to everybody . Enjoy your dinner . - Thanks . But I got ta tell you , the thing Nicky liked most was the showgirls , naturally . I mean , to them , Nicky was the movie star . - You walk past me ? - Hey , this is Shelly . - Hey , Shelly . How are you ? - Hi . - And this is Stacy . - Stacy . -
zone1	Pleasure . Let 's check the kitchen first . Excuse us one second . Come on . I 'll show you . I fly stuff in fresh every day . I get bread from back home . I get fish from California . And you can always tell a great kitchen like ours because of the milk-fed veal . That 's the secret . See , milk-fed veal is pure white . Out here they got that pink veal . Slide over , honey . Now , pink veal , you can pound that shit for two days . It 'll never , ever get tender . You know what I mean ? I left here with the money . Got muscled on the street . A couple guys , I owe them . So I gave them the money . - That 's what I did . - Yeah ? - Yeah . - You call yourself a man ? You know you 're a lyin ' lowlife , motherfuckin ' gamblin ' degenerate prick ? You know that 's what you are ? Two small kids at home
zone1	rent ... and buy groceries , put the heat on . Your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin ' heat 's off . And you did n't gamble that fuckin ' money ? - No ? You did n't ? - I did n't -- Do n't fuck with me , Al ! Do n't make a fuck outta me . You wan na embarrass me and make a fool outta me ? You did n't gamble ? Tell me you gambled the fuckin ' money ... I 'll give you the fuckin ' money to put the fuckin ' heat on ! Did you gamble ? Huh ? Fuckin ' degenerate . Fuckin ' kids at home . Here . Get the fuck outta here . - Thanks , Nick . - Yeah , thanks . Let me find out you fucked up . I 'll leave you where I find you . How many of these you gon na eat ? - Two . - Two ? But around 6:30 in the morning , when he finished his day ... no matter where he was or
zone1	make breakfast for his son , Nicky boy . I know you like this . A little butter , right ? - Not a lot . You know why , right ? - Yeah . - Why ? - ' Cause it clogs up your heart . What a smart kid you are . Okay , eat . Every couple of weeks , I used to send Marino ... back to the bosses with a piece of what I made . Not a bit piece , but what did they know ? They were 1,500 miles away , and I do n't know anybody who can see that far . Their drop was a truck stop garage ... where Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions . - Remo . - Hey , Frankie . The cops knew , but they did n't give a fuck . Nicky sends his warmest regards . I knew how to keep the bosses happy . Whenever they gave me little jobs to do ... I would carry things out to a " T . " Like the time
zone1	maniac tough guy in town ... shot up one of Remo 's bars . Here 's a fuckin ' guy kills two of Remo 's guys ... and a poor fuckin ' waitress who was just workin ' on her night off , of all things . I mean , this guy 's just beggin ' to be made an example of . Frankie , I want the names of all the other people he had with him . And I do n't care what you have to do to ' em to get ' em , understand ? - I 'll take care of it , Remo . - And mow ' em down . To be truthful with you , I had to admire this guy . He was one of the toughest lrishmen I ever met . - This son of a bitch was tough . For two days and two fuckin ' nights we beat the shit outta this guy . We even stuck ice picks in his balls . - Better give me a name soon , or I 'm gon na give him yours
zone1	he never talked . - I know you would 've ratted by now . In the end , I had to put his fuckin ' head in a vise . Dogs , Dogs , can you hear me , Dogs ? Listen to me , Anthony . I got your head in a vise . I 'll squash your fuckin ' head like a grapefruit if you do n't give me a name . Do n't make me have to do this . Please . Come on ! Do n't make me be a bad guy . Come on . Fuck you ! This motherfucker . You believe this ? Two fuckin ' days and nights . Fuck me ? Fuck me ? You motherfucker ! Fuck my mother ? ls that what you 're tellin ' me ? - You motherfucker , you ! Huh ? - Oh , God ! - Give me the fuckin ' name ! Charlie M . - Charlie M . ? - Charlie M . You make me pop your fuckin ' eye outta your head ... to protect that piece of shit
zone1	me , you fuck ! Kill me ! You motherfucker , you ! Frankie , do him a fuckin ' favor . The word got around that finally ... there was a real gangster in town . Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas . Charlie M . Four reels , sevens , across three $15,000 jackpots . Do you have any idea what the odds are ? It 's got ta be in the millions , maybe more . Three fuckin ' jackpots in 20 minutes ! Why did n't you call me ? It happened so quick . Three guys won . I did n't have a chance . - You did n't see the scam ? - There 's no way to determine that . Yes , there is . They won ! It 's a casino . People got ta win sometimes . Ward , you 're pissing me off . Now you 're insulting my intelligence . You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin ' reels . The probability on one machine is a million and
zone1	row , it 's in the billions . What 's the matter with you ? Did n't you see you were being set up on the second win ? I think you 're overreacting . Listen , you fuckin ' yokel . I 've been carrying your ass ever since I got here . - Get your ass outta here . - You 're firing me ? I 'm firing you . No , I 'm not firing -- - You might regret this . - I 'll regret it if I keep you . This is not the way to treat people . If you did n't know , you 're too fuckin ' dumb . If you did know , you were in on it . Either way , you 're out . Get out . Come on . Let 's go . The guy 's history as far as I 'm concerned . But you ca n't fire him . His brother-in-law is County Commissioner . Everybody with cowboy boots is a fuckin ' county commissioner or related to a commissioner . This is his state .
zone1	county commission . You 're in the finances , you 're upstairs . But you are not on the floor . You do n't see what 's going on . I 've got thousands of players . I 've got 500 dealers . They 're all looking to rob me blind 24 hours a day . I have to let them know I 'm watching all the details all the time . There is not one single thing I will not catch . - Look at yours . Look at that . - Huh ? Look at this . There 's nothing . Look how many blueberries your muffin has . What are you talking about ? If you do n't do it yourself , it never gets done . From now on , I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin . An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin . Do you know how long that 's going to take ? I do n't care how long it takes . Put an equal amount in each muffin . Just a little . That
zone1	wan na go to Mommy ? Wan na come to Mommy ? It 's all right , sweetheart . I need to talk to you . I need some money . - What do you need ? - Got her ? Well , I need a lot . I need more than usual . Why do n't you take it out of your account ? I would , you know , Sam , it 's just that -- Well , I need more than that . I need $25,000 . Twenty-five thousand ? For yourself ? - Yeah . - Why do you need that much ? What 's the difference ? I just need it . Well , I got ta ask you . That 's a lot of money . You 're not asking for a box of popcorn . We do n't have to turn this into a big deal . Okay ? We do n't have to have a fight . It 's important to me . Just something I wanted to do . Who 's fighting ? I mean , tell me what it 's
zone1	's for ? Huh ? Well , you know what ? Now I want you to tell me . My wife comes to me and asks me for 25,000 . What do you want , a coat ? - No . - If you want a coat , you got it . It 's not the money . It 's just , why do you want it ? Am I not entitled to ask that ? Sam , I 've been independent my whole life . I never had to ask anybody for anything . - Now you 're making me beg . - What are you talking about ? And you 're embarrassing me . Why do you want to make me feel so bad ? You 're asking me for 25,000 . I 'm not out to make you feel bad . I want to just be able to trust you . You know , it 's about trust . I have to be able to trust you with my life . Do you understand ? Can I trust you ? Can I trust you ? Can I
zone1	? You can trust me . Good . So then you could tell me what the money is for . Yeah , she 's leaving the bank now . All right , I 'm gon na follow her . What is that ? I know that look . What does that look mean ? It means I got the money . Yes , you 're way up on top now . How are you doin ' , Les ? It 's Lester , right ? Sam . From my recollection , are n't you the card shark ... the golf hustler , the pimp from Beverly Hills ? If I 'm wrong , please correct me . ' Cause I never knew you to be a heist man . But if you are , you know what ? Here , take mine too . Go ahead . Take it . ' Cause you already have hers . She 's my wife . Look at me . You did know that , did n't you ? You knew that she 's my wife ? - Hey , look at me .
zone1	yeah ? But if you ever come back again , ever ... to take her money , next time bring a pistol . That way you got a chance . Be a man . Do n't be a fucking pimp . Now , you wan na do me a favor ? Get outta here . I wan na be alone with my wife . Get up and get outta here . - And you want to be free . Why , you feel that you are too good ... much too good for a nobody like me . - Fuckin ' piece of shit . - That 's fuckin ' bullshit . - Well , darling , I guess it 's best ... - that we should part . Remember when you called him that night and said good-bye ? He did n't say , " Do n't get married . I 'll be right down . " - He did n't say that to you , did he ? - No , he did n't . No . Instead , what did he say ? " Fuck him .
zone1	here . I want to show you something . - The second letter came right after I gave you your start . - No ! No ! No ! No ! Make ' em stop it ! - No ! No ! It 's not his fault ! It 's my fault ! No ! - Fuck ! Fuck ! - Piece of shit . Do it yourself , you chickenshit cocksucker ! He 's such a prick ! He had some guy from the hotel beat him up . He did n't want to do it himself . Oh , no , he did n't want to get his own hands dirty . So why did he have to do that , huh ? Tell me . - I know it was n't a nice thing to do -- - No shit . You got ta understand it . He does n't know if this guy is shaking you down -- No . No . I told him all about this guy before we ever got married . - This is no fucking surprise . - Oh , you
zone1	just a friend of mine I was trying to help . So what ? You know , the first time I ever saw you guys together ... I never saw him so happy . I mean , I know he 's a crazy Jew fuck and everything ... but I never seen him act like that with anybody else . I think he 's crazy about you . I mean , he really loves you . Come on . I went into this with my eyes open , you know . I knew the bottom could drop out at any time . You do n't think I 'm gon na go into a situation like this ... if I do n't think I 'm gon na get covered on the back end . - Sure , I can see that . - Right ? So I put aside some jewelry for me . A lot of jewelry . You mean like a lot of expensive jewelry ? About how much ? You want to steal it ? No . I 'm just curious . I was wondering ... how much
zone1	'm told it 's worth about a million dollars , maybe more . Well , there you go . What does that tell you ? A million dollars in jewelry . Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you ? I should 've never married him . He 's a Gemini . Triple Gemini . Duality . Gemini is the snake , you know . You ca n't trust a snake . I mean it . I know what you mean . Listen , Ginger . You know , this is probably not - - I do n't have the answers anyway . - This is probably not what you want to hear ... - I do . ' cause you 're a little upset , and I understand that . But I think you should try to make the best of it now . Go slow . See what happens . He could 've killed him ! Okay ? He could 've killed him . He did n't have to hit him . It 's not like I 'm sleeping with the guy . He makes me
zone1	that all about ? I guess it 's ' cause he loves you so much , he 's jealous and worried . He gives a fuck what I do . Look , I 'll try to find out what the hell is going on . - When I see him , I 'll talk to him . - Okay . - All right ? - Yeah . Thanks . Thanks for putting up with me . Take it easy with this shit . This can only make matters worse . You 're a beautiful girl . I 've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this . You 're so nice . Come on , now . I do n't wan na see you unhappy . - Thanks . - Thank you . - It 's all right . Mr . Rothstein , County Commissioner Pat Webb is here to see you . - Give me a minute . - Okay . Just a minute . Mr . Webb , can I get you anything ? Uh , no . No , thank you , little lady
zone1	four minutes after . - Mr . Rothstein , I 'm Pat Webb . - How do you do ? - Hey , it is a pleasure . - I heard a lot about you . Oh , thank you , sir . Hey , house is doin ' well . Hey , all that money is rollin ' in . I appreciate you takin ' the time to see a poor civil servant . - Why do n't you have a seat , hmm ? - Oh , thank you , sir . I come here personally to kind of smooth over ... any fracas about a certain matter . See , uh , maybe you did n't know it ... but Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town . He 's got lots of friends . Nice family and their money go back many , many years . Now friends vote . Family and money votes . That 's important to me and you . And if you 'll think about our little problem along them lines - - and you 'll forgive me for
zone1	to be fired . I 'm sorry , but he knew about our getting hit ... on three big machines in a row , and he did nothing about it . That means , either he was in on it or he was too dumb to see what was goin ' on . Either way , I can not have a man like that working here . Before we point the dirty end of the stick at old Don ... we better be sure we can prove them charges . Believe me , if I could prove it , he would be under arrest . Are , uh -- Are we certain that you want the Gaming Control Board ... eyeballing your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro . I think you 're way out of line talking to me like that . What you 're saying is libelous , and you 're in no position to challenge my expertise . I went way out of my way to be very helpful to that kid . He 's weak . He 's incompetent . He jeopardizes the whole
zone1	for him . You have got me there . Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar . But he is my brother-in-law ... and I would look on it as a personal favor ... if you 'd think some more on hiring ' him back . I ca n't do that . I appreciate the fact that he 's your brother-in-law ... and I do want to help you and I like to do favors . I know who you are , but I can not do that . Well , could there be any position ... farther down the trough ? I 'm sorry . I ca n't do anything . He 's too incompetent , and the bottom line is , he can not be trusted . Okay . Thanks . Well ... you know , that 's it . I 'm sorry . Mr . Rothstein , your people never will understand ... the way it works out here . You 're all just our guests . But you act like you 're at home . Let me tell you something , partner .
zone1	're gon na send you if it harelips the governor . - Thank you for your time . - No problem . - Sorry . - You bet . What happened to my pills ? Huh ? Is n't it bad enough you 're drinking too much ? You 're taking my pills too ? I did n't take your pills . Look , for my ulcer , I take a half a one of these . And that 's when I have extreme pain . I had a three-month supply . What did you do with ' em ? You did n't have to beat him up . What ? I was just trying to help him . Like I 'm sleeping with the guy . Yeah , how do I know ? You ca n't make me stop caring about people . What ? What ? I said , you ca n't make me ... stop caring about people . Listen ... Ginger ... I 'm trying to make the best of everything here , you know ? I mean , you 're my wife , for Christ
zone1	you in this town . You know what , Ace ? I do n't give a shit ! I 'm gettin ' out of here . I am . Come over here . You got ta get hold of yourself . - Okay . Okay . - If not for me , at least for Amy . Understand ? Your drinking 's gettin ' way out of hand . I 'm gon na get you into a program . They got plenty of good one's . - I do n't need one . - Yes , you do . It 's very discreet . There 's no names in the papers . That 's all you care about . You do n't care about me . - Yes , I do . - No , you do n't . How could you say that ? You 're a beautiful woman . You 're destroying yourself . You do n't need that fuckin ' leech living off you . I know you better than you know yourself . You 're a tiger . You 're stronger than I am . When
zone1	it better than anybody . You 're gon na do it . Okay ? You 'll do it . Oh , God . Oh , God . Okay . Okay . I 'll try . I 'll try . I 'll try . I will . Do n't be mad at me , okay ? I will . No matter what the problems were outside the count room ... it was all worth it . The cash kept rollin ' in ... and the suitcases kept comin ' and goin ' . And let me tell you , the fuckin ' bottom line here is ... cash . The only problem was that after a while ... the bosses noticed that the suitcases were gettin ' a little light . Wait a minute . You mean to tell me ... that the money we 're robbing is being robbed ? Somebody 's robbing from us ? We go through all this trouble and somebody 's robbing us ? Huh ? Like I said , it 's part of the business . It 's considered leakage . Leakage my balls .
zone1	John Nash - - that 's the guy who ran the scam - - he knew there was n't much he could do about it . You got ta know that a guy who helps you steal ... even if you take care of him real well ... he 's gon na steal a little extra for himself . Makes sense , do n't it ? Try and make these hardheaded old greaseballs understand that . What 's the point of skimming if we 're being skimmed ? It defeats the purpose . Huh ? They take this money because they 're my guys , so give ' em some leeway . But the bosses never believed in leeway ... so listen to what they do . They put Artie Piscano , the underboss of K.C ... . in charge of making sure nobody skimmed the skim . - What were you doin ' ? - I was with my cumma . - What are you doin ' with your cumma ? - I gave her a scheff . The only trouble was , Piscano was a disaster . This
zone1	What you been doin ' ? - I 'm out there more than I 'm here . And little did anybody know where this would lead . If they did , they 'd would 've been better off makin ' fuckin ' novena . You got ta go back there and talk to that guy . - I never got paid my expenses for the last trip . - What expenses ? I 'm layin ' money outta my own pocket , and I never get anything back . You got ta go back out there . From now on , I 'm gon na start keeping ' records . No records , Artie . What are you gon na do with records , pay taxes ? I keep laying ' out my own fuckin ' dough . What the hell are we doin ' over here ? You 're goin ' to Las Vegas at my expense . Oh , fuck . I mean , after all -- No matter how many novenas you could make ... nothing was gon na stop what came up next . - I
zone1	made a deal . It turned out Phil Green , Mr . Integrity ... had a partner nobody knew about . And when she showed up and started demanding money -- - Why are you doing this ? - Because you 're wrong . - Yes , you are . - No , I am not wrong . Green tried to stonewall her . I will see to it that you do not get away with this . So , she sued him in court . The court will now hear the matter of the plaintiff , Anna Scott ... against Tangiers Corporation and its president , Phil Green . - Oberon on behalf of Mr . Green . - Logan on behalf of Anna Scott . - Mr . Oberon , you can proceed . - Thank you , Judge . I believe he was fair , and I 'm delighted with the decision . We got a problem . It did n't go too well . Green has to open up the books ... has to show how he got the financing . Hey , that 's not
zone1	lawsuit . But before she could start countin ' her money ... the boys back home decided to settle the case out of court . So they sent me . Can you comment on the murder of Anna Scott ? - What are you talking about ? - She was found last night shot in the head . Was this just a real estate partnership ? Her lawyer said you were partners . We were involved in minor real estate deals many years ago . It was never a partnership . Did you ever hear of the .22 Caliber Killer ? Now , instead of the cops only looking at Nicky ... they started looking at Green too . And he was supposed to be our squeaky-clean front man . I had to start giving interviews to make sure everybody knew ... the casino was on the up-and-up . So how often do you really fill in for him ? Green 's here about two or three times a month ... and he 's busy with real estate deals . So in Green 's absence , then , you 're
zone1	chairman of the board . My responsibilities are to run the day-to-day operations . So day-to-day , then , you 're the boss ? Well , in a sense , you could say that I am the boss ... when Mr . Green is away . You could say that . Hmm , have you read this ? About Mr . Rothstein . It says , " The Midwest bookmaker with mob ties ... says that he is the real boss of the $100 million ... Tangiers casino empire . " Did he really say that ? Why , of course he said that . It 's right here . Has that man even filed for his license yet ? I do n't know . We have to check the files . Without gettin ' your shorts in a knot , would you do that ? And kinda check closely , ' cause we may have to kick a kike 's ass outta town . Thank you . A Gaming Control Board investigation ... of Tangiers executive Sam Rothstein 's application ... for a gaming license is underway . Rothstein
zone1	boyhood friend ... of Las Vegas mob boss Nicky Santoro ... could lose his ability to work in the casino -- - Hello ? - I got ta meet Clean Face . What about the Chez Paris ? - You can't . - You got ta make a reservation . It 's all booked up . - No , no . It 's impossible . You got ta make a reservation . It 's very difficult to get in . I 'll use the service entrance . I 'll see you at 9:00 . All right . The battle between State gaming officials and Tangiers Casino boss ... Sam " Ace " Rothstein is heating up . Tonight , an up-to-the-minute look at Ace Rothstein 's attempt to get state licensing ... despite law enforcement allegations of Rothstein 's organized crime connections . Will Sam Rothstein 's friendship with alleged organized crime figure Nicky Santoro ... keep Rothstein from running the Tangiers Casino ? And can the integrity of state gaming laws be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship ? - Why do n't you take it easy on that stuff
zone1	down . We 're talking about some stuff . At 6:00 : Will a boyhood friendship unseat Rothstein as the Tangiers Casino boss ? Exclusive on the KBBO special news report . - Go down . Just ... go downst-You ca n't let this concern you , Ace . Do n't worry . It 's just a political witch hunt . Ace . Do you want something to drink ? - Charlie , a refill ? - Yeah , great . No . Hey , Mr . Clark . I 've been tryin ' to reach you . - You 're tougher to get than the president . - Well , I 've been busy . Yeah ? At least you could return my phone calls , though . Listen , Nicky , we talked about this . And I explained to you that you might have to take some kind of loss . Yeah . I think I want my money back . What are you gon na do , strong-arm me ? - You know , I think you 've gotten the wrong impression about me . I
zone1	you exactly what it is that I do . Tomorrow morning I 'll get up nice and early , take a walk to the bank ... and walk in and see , and , uh , if you do n't have my money for me ... I 'll crack your fuckin ' head wide open in front of everybody . And just about the time that I 'm comin ' out of jail ... hopefully you 'll be comin ' out of your coma . And guess what ? I 'll split your fuckin ' head open again . ' Cause I 'm fuckin ' stupid . I do n't give a fuck about jail . That 's my business . That 's what I do . We know what you do . You fuck people out of money and get away with it . - You ca n't talk to me like that . - Hey , you fat lrish prick ! You put my money to sleep ! - Get my money , or I 'll put your brain to sleep . - Sam ! Never mind Sam
zone1	the morning . You can try me , Fatso . You fuckin ' try me . You think he got the point ? What 're you doin ' ? He 's a square guy , for chrissakes . He 's gon na run to the F.B.I . That prick 's been dodging ' me for three weeks . You 're tryin ' to tell me what to do . I 'm not tryin ' to tell you what to do . You 're outta line . Where 's your head ? Where 's my head ? Where 's your fuckin ' balls ? I 'm tryin ' to put somethin ' big together here . You know what I 'm talkin ' about . If you 're actin ' like this now , can I depend on you ? A lot of things gon na change . If you wan na be there with me , you 're gon na have to go my way . Listen , Nick , understand my situation . I 'm responsible for thousands of people . I got a hundred million a year goin
zone1	I do n't get that license . If it goes bad for me , it 's bad for a lot of people . Forget about your fuckin ' license . I plant my own flag , you ai n't gon na need a license . You know , I do n't know what it is , Sammy , but the more I talk to you ... the more I feel like you just do n't want to go along with me . - No , I do n't want to come along with you . - All right , fine . I do n't want to be involved in anything you 're talking about , okay ? I want to run a square joint . I just want my license . I want everything quiet . That 's it ! Quiet like this ? " I 'm the boss " ? That 's quiet ? That 's taken out of context . I had no control over that . - Ronnie and Billy will tell you exactly what happened . - Back home that looks bad . Looks bad ?
zone1	. That looks bad . - What the fuck happened to you ? - What happened to me ? - What happened to you ? You lost control . - I lost control ? Look at you , you 're fuckin ' walkin ' around like John Barrymore . A pink robe and a fuckin ' cigarette holder ? I lost control ? I do n't wan na bring this up , but you been treatin ' people with disrespect , even your wife . My wife ? What does she have to do with this ? She was upset about a lot of things , especially that whole fuckin ' Lester Diamond incident . You 're the shoulder to cry on ? Did you her tell about your little role in that situation ? No , that 's not the fuckin ' point . - The point is , she 's upset , and you 've got a problem . - I would appreciate it ... if you stay out of my personal life . - You would n't like it if I did it to you . -
zone1	supposed to do ? Throw her out ? - Stay away from her . It 's none of your business . - It 's none of my business ? A week ago it was . Now it 's none of my business . When you need me , you need me . The way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen . I 'm gon na have to straighten out what you did with this guy . This guy is gon na run to the F.B.I . now . Your head 's bigger than your casino . I knew what he wanted . Nicky wanted to take over . He wanted to go after Gaggi , the skim , everything and everybody . Plus , he had stopped asking permission from back home for every little thing . A casino boss and his wife were killed . The bulls questioned Nicky . A dealer from the Sirocco . They questioned Nicky . A bunch of stool pigeons wound up in the trunks of their cars . They questioned Nicky . A lawyer . - They questioned Nicky
zone1	began disappearing ... Nicky 's name was in every one of those newspapers . Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders , but they always had to let him go . There were never any witnesses . The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong . Watch yourself . You 're gon na get runned over , there . If a guy fuckin ' tripped over a banana peel , they 'd bring me in for it . Come on , be nice , huh ? And the bosses were no better . They complained because things do n't run smooth . In my line of work , things do n't run so smooth . I 'm sorry . I 'm dealin ' with degenerate animals out here . But the bosses , what do they give a fuck ? They 're sittin ' on their asses drinking ' anisette . I 'm the guy in the trenches . Fuckin ' bosses think it 's a fuckin ' free lunch out here . Frankie , they found a guy 's head in the desert . You know about that
zone1	Yeah . Everybody 's talkin ' . They 're makin ' a big deal out of it . It 's in all the papers . What are you gon na do ? And I mean , that 's no good . You got ta tell him to take care of things a little better . I 'll tell him , Remo . Fuckin ' bosses ; they 're smokin ' their Di Nobilis ... and they 're eatin ' trippa and fuckin ' suffritte , you know , fried pigs ' guts . If I want to talk private , I got ta go to a bus stop . - What do they care long as I keep sendin ' money back ? - They 're complaining ' . Let ' em complain . I 'm the one who 's here . I do all the work . - Somebody do n't like it , fuck ' em . - It 's up to you . They want a fuckin ' war ? I 'm ready . All I got ta do is take care of five of those guys
zone1	you fucks , you . I see you , you motherfuckers . Nicky was not only bringing heat on himself but on me too . The F.B.I . watched every move he made , but he did n't care . He just did n't care . If they 're gon na watch me , I 'm gon na watch ' em right back . I spent a few bucks . Top dollar . Who gives a shit ? I got the latest anti-buggin ' equipment from the same places that sell to the fuckin ' C.I.A . I had special police frequency radios , F.B.I . de-scramblers , cameras that see in the dark . And because of that , the miserable sons of bitches never caught me doin ' anything . I got my job on the line , and this guy 's havin ' the time of his life . He has every cop in the state watchin ' him , and he 's out playin ' golf . And at the worst possible time for me . I had my license hearing coming up , and I
zone1	mean , if I ca n't work in Vegas , where am I gon na go ? You 've been very open with us . I mean , your books and papers . That 's gon na mean something when you go before the commission . - All I ask is a fair hearing . - This kind of honesty will guarantee that fair hearing . - All right , well , we 'll move on to -- - I wanted to hear something about Kansas City . What the fuck is this ? Where 's this guy gon na land , the fairway ? They 're fuckin ' agents , Frankie . Look at this . The Feds were watching Nicky play golf for so long ... they ran out of gas . Just what I needed , right in front of the Control Board . A hundred dollars , whoever hits the plane . And as if things were n't bad enough , in comes Piscano , the Kansas City underboss . He ran that little grocery store in Kansas City where they bought the suitcases . Fightin
zone1	means , right ? I got ta take another trip to Vegas , and it 's gon na cost me another couple grand . He ran it with his brother-in-law ... but mostly what he did was complain about his trips to Vegas . You got ta lay down the law , otherwise they 're gon na make a fool out of you . I write it all down . Every fuckin ' nickel goes down . Receipts -- - Hey , oh , wha - - What 's the matter with you ? - Everything 's here . - Since when do you talk like that ? - I 'm sorry . Nance gives me trouble , I 'll tell him I 'll take the eyes out of his frickin ' head . - Again . - I said , " frickin ' head . " - That 's enough . - I 'm sorry . What happens next ? You ca n't believe it . Who would believe that the F.B.I . had a wire in the place ... Iookin ' for some information about some old homicide
zone1	over God knows what . What 's to prevent him with the suitcases that he could take what he wants ? Fuckin ' Nance takes back two suitcases from the Tangiers . What about three or four ? We 've got nobody in the room to watch . That 's the law . We ca n't even go into the count room to watch our money . You believe this bullshit ? Sure , he 's got his people in there . They could all be in on it together , those fucks . I 'll find out . If it 's Green , I 'll bury that bastard . I never trusted him . They trust that scumbag . I don't . - I 'll hit the two of them with a fuckin ' shovel . - Take it easy . Ma , I 'm sorry . They 're beatin ' me left and right . - Ma , I 'm sorry . I 'm all upset . - I know , but that 's enough . You know what they 're doin ' . I ca n't take
zone1	it easy . You 'll get a heart attack like that . - I know . I 'm too upset . And the damn thing is , they hear all this stuff ... about Las Vegas and the casinos and suitcases ... and that 's it . Everything 's comin ' outta my pocket . I got ta pay . Would you believe that such a thing could happen ? I 'm in this to make money , not to lose money . Every F.B.I . man across the country had their ears open now . If you want something done right you got ta do it yourself . I mean , Piscano , this guy basically sunk the whole world . There are some that are good and some that are bad . Mr . Chairman , members of the commission ... Mr . Rothstein is pleased to be here today . When the day finally came , I was ready . I felt so confident that all I had to do was present my case . We have documents , one of which is a report by retired
zone1	from any wrongdoing . - Counselor , before you continue -- - I want to have this marked -- This commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application . - Denying ? - Do I hear a motion seconded ? Mr . Chairman , I second the motion . Do I have a vote on the motion ? - Aye . - Aye . Aye . The ayes have it . This hearing is adjourned . - You have to be kidding . - Adjourned ? What do you mean , " Adjourned " ? Senator , you promised me a hearing . You did n't even look at the F.B.I . reports . When you were my guest at the Tangiers Hotel , did you not promise me a fair hearing ? - I was never your guest . - You were never my guest ? I never comped you ? - I do n't comp you at least three times a month ? - I 'd like to answer that . Mr . Rothstein is being very typical to this point . He 's
zone1	was with Barney Greenstein . - Was I at that dinner ? Tell me , was I at that dinner ? - You were wandering . - Was I at that dinner ? Was I ? - You were wandering . - You were ... in the - - You were in the building . - I was in the building ? You know I was at that dinner , and you swore to me I would have a fair hearing . Did you not ? Did you not ? Well , tell me I was at least at the dinner . Allow me that much . - Give me that much at least ! - Yes , you were . Thanks for not calling me a liar , you son of a bitch . You son of a -- A routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday ... when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive , Sam " Ace " Rothstein ... - What are you runnin ' for , Bob ? - accused the state 's top gaming officials of corruption . You promised me when you were getting
zone1	copies of your bill so you could put ' em on your expense account . In a wild outburst that followed his gaming license denial ... - Bullshit ! Bullshit ! - Rothstein followed several ... stunned commissioners into the hallway where he continued his harangue ... until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave . You have a past . I have a past . My past is no worse than yours . But you guys think you have the right to pass judgment ! Long suspected of running the Tangiers without a license ... yesterday 's hearing was to determine whether someone with Rothstein 's history ... was qualified to officially hold a top gaming post . Fuckin ' hypocrites ! - What the hell 's he gon na do now ? - I do n't know . What 's he doin ' ? He knows all those guys he yelled at are friends of ours . What 's the matter with him , making all this mess ? Maybe he could run things with another job title . What are we gon na do ?
zone1	quiet . Let him hide upstairs in the office . Say he 's a janitor . I do n't give a shit . But , please , whatever job he takes , make sure it 's something quick Ladies and gentlemen ... the Tangiers Hotel proudly presents the all-new ... Sam Rothstein show , Aces High . Tonight , taped live from the all-new Sports Book ... we present the premiere showing of Aces High ... with the Sasha Semenoff Orchestra ... and the Sam Rothstein Dancers ! Mr . Rothstein is a professional gambler and the best football handicapper in America ; a man who will take you inside the real Las Vegas as no one has ever done before . And now , ladies and gentlemen , the new entertainment director of the Tangiers Hotel Casino ... - Mr . Sam Rothstein . Welcome to the Sam Rothstein Show . We 're very happy to have you here this evening . The young lady to my left is Trudy , who is ... a lead new dancer in our fabulous show from Paris . - Our first guest
zone1	eye on him . - I 've got a large family . - How many kids do you have ? - I 'm very proud to say that we have eight children . - No , no , please . Please . - That 's amazing . - There 's nothing to it . It was my pleasure . - Ace , do n't do it . Oh , no , no . Oh , no . Oh , Jesus . He 's juggling ! Let 's not take Commissioner Pat Webb too seriously . I recently challenged him to a debate on this program , and he declined . What are you worried about , Pat ? You do n't have to send me any questions . You can ask me anything you want . What the hell is he doin ' on television , anyway ? He 's on all night , screamin ' about how he 's gon na take his lawsuit to the Supreme Court . He really must be crazy . He 's gon na go to Washington with this ? He 's out of
zone1	have such hypocrisy . Some people do what they want . Other people have to pay through the nose . Such is life . Andy , go see him . Tell him maybe it 's time he should quit . First of all , what they did was totally unconstitutional . We 're on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States . These guys do n't give a fuck about the Supreme Court . They want you to walk away . Walk away ? Andy , you ca n't be serious . How can I walk away ? Do n't you see what 's at stake ? The old man said maybe your friend should give in . When the old man says " maybe , " that 's like a papal bull . Not only should you quit , you should run . Every time they mention my name in the papers , they mention Nicky too . How the fuck does that help ? The heat he brought down is murder . The police department was cooperative . He pissed ' em
zone1	What are you proposing ? - I do n't know . He does n't listen to me . Maybe he should get lost for awhile . Would that be so bad ? - They ai n't sending ' Nicky nowhere . - If he took a break ... it would give everybody time to maneuver . I would forget about the maneuver . I would just get out . I ca n't do that . As soon as Andy got home , Nicky heard about our talk . Next morning , bright and early , I get the call . Great . You know , I 've got to do some shopping . You want to go ? Getting a call from Nicky was n't easy . Even the codes did n't work . So we figured out another act . If a phone 's tapped , the Feds can only listen in on the stuff involving crimes . So on routine calls , they have to click off after a few minutes . Yeah , I got a sprained fuckin ' elbow . - Yeah . - Meet me
zone1	yards down the road . - Why ? - Do n't ask questions . Just be there . Suzy Cream Cheese has the exact same outfit . I saw something . Something very cute . Okay , he 's out . It 's the ant . Brown unit . And he 's with the bogey . I think it 's Frankie . Nicky started out before me ... because it was n't that easy for him to get around . Nicky could n't even go for a ride without changing cars ... at least six times before he could shake all his tails . Because of the planes , he had to use underground garages . Meeting in the middle of the desert always made me nervous . It 's a scary place . I knew about the holes in the desert , of course . And everywhere I looked , there could have been a hole . Normally , my prospects of comin ' back alive ... from a meetin ' with Nicky were 99 out of 100 . But this time , when I heard him say a
zone1	myself 50-50 . Where the fuck you get off talkin ' to people behind my back , goin ' over my head ? - What people ? - What people ? What 'd you think , I was n't gon na find out ? I do n't even know what you 're talkin ' about . You said I 'm bringin ' heat on you ? I got ta listen to people because of your shit ? You 're ordering ' me out ? You better get your own fuckin ' army , pal ! I did n't order you or anybody . I told Andy Stone that you had heat , and that was a problem . - You want me to get out of my own fuckin ' town ? - Yeah . Let the bullshit blow over so I can run the casino . Anything goes wrong with the casino , it 's my ass . It 's not yours . It 's my ass . I do n't know whether you know you have your fuckin ' casino because I made that possible ! I 'm
zone1	clubs or your fuckin ' TV shows ! And what the fuck are you doin ' on TV anyhow ? I get calls from home every day . They think you went batshit ! I 'm only on TV because I got ta be able to hang around the casino . You understand . You could have had the food-and-beverage job without goin ' on television ! You wanted to go on TV . Yeah , I wanted to go on TV . That way I have a forum . I can fight back . They know they ca n't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown . That 's right . You 're makin ' a spectacle of yourself . Me ? I would n't even be in this situation if it was n't for you . Every time I meet somebody , the question is : Do I know you ? - Sure , now you wan na blame your fuckin ' license on me . - No , Nicky . When you asked me if you could come out here ... what
zone1	Back up a fuckin ' minute here . - Do you remember what I told you ? I asked you ? When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here ? Get this through your head , you Jew motherfucker , you ! You only exist out here because of me ! That 's the only reason ! Without me , you personally -- Every fuckin ' wise guy still around will take a piece of your fuckin ' Jew ass ! Then where you gon na go ? You 're fuckin ' warned . Do n't go over my head again , you motherfucker , you ! - Well , we got company . - Did you see that ? Dumb Jew motherfucker . Grew up together , and he 's actin ' like he do n't know me . I know we 're supposed to avoid each other , but there 's ways to do things . Fuck him . - To Abraham Lincoln . - Do n't let it bother you . - Does it look like it 's botherin ' me
zone1	. He wo n't even look over . What 's his fuckin ' problem ? - Fuckin ' Jews stick together , do n't they ? - They 're havin ' a good time . - So are we . - Yeah ? - Sam , we got a problem . - What is it ? The little guy . Nobody told him he was eighty-sixed from the joint . We turned our heads and made out we did n't know who he was . He 's over at the 21 table with his nose wide open . He took money out of his own kick . His nose is open for about 10,000 . - Now he 's really pissed . - Oh , no . - He wants a 50,000 marker . - Just give him ten . That 's it . I 'll be right down . - He 's gon na come up with 10,000 , the way you want it . - No , 50,000 . I said 50 ! Go get it . I do n't give a fuck where you get it .
zone1	How the fuck can you grin ? How the fuck can you grin ? You know how much I 'm stuck ? You give a fuck ? Do you ? Give yourself a hand , right across your fuckin ' mouth . Look at this beaut they put in now . Sherbert send you to rob me now ? Been fuckin ' knockin ' everybody 's dick all night ? Been beating the customers ? Huh , jag-off ? Hit me . Take this stiff and pound it up your fuckin ' ass . Hit me again . Take this one and stick it up your sister 's ass . Hit me again . That 's it . Keep lookin ' at him . If you had any heart at all , you 'd be stealin ' for a livin ' . Hit me again ! What the fuck you keep lookin ' at him for ? You fuckin ' - - Look at this , 20 fuckin ' paints in a row . Hit me again . You should pay as fast as you collect , you know .
zone1	this Jew motherfucker to pay that marker off . I 'm here to help you . You 're gon na bury us both . - Just give me the money . Give me the fuckin ' money . - I 'm gon na okay you ten . Then you got ta get out before the cops are all over you . Ten and that 's it . What are you starin ' at , you bald-headed Jew prick ? - Come on , come on . Let 's get outta here . - Sue me , you Jew fuck ! Get outta here ? I got a marker comin ' . Deal . Everything 's changed now . You 're talking about a divorce . You 're asking for alimony payments and child support , and now custody . I just want what any divorced woman would get . She 's only sober about two hours a day . It 's usually from 11:00 in the morning ' til 1:00 in the afternoon . If I gave her her money and her jewels , she 's gon na piss it
zone1	then ? Comin ' right back to me ... - or finding ' some other excuse to come -- - We had a deal . Remember that ? He said if it did n't work out between us , I could get my things , and I could leave . Look in my eyes . Look-Look in my eyes . You know me . Do you see anything that makes you think I would ever let ... someone in your condition take my child away from me ? Do you ? You know that wo n't happen . And after all this time ... and as hard as I tried , as much as I wanted ... I could never reach her . I could never make her love me . I always felt she should have gone for all that money ... being somebody for the first time in her life ... a home , a kid . That 's not what happened . It did n't work out that way . - Everything all right ? I mean , what could we do ? After a while ,
zone1	separations . At that time , I remember Ginger took Amy to Beverly Hills . She was gon na spend a week shopping . - Yes , Mr . Rothstein . - Operator , the Beverly Hotel in Beverly Hills , please . - Beverly Hotel . - Mrs . Sam Rothstein , please . Mr . and Mrs . Rothstein have checked out already . Mr . and Mrs . Rothstein ? Hey , little Dale Evans . - Yes , they both checked out . - Thank you . Hello . Yeah . My wife is with an old friend of hers in L.A . Some lowlife . A guy named Lester Diamond . My daughter is with them , and I think they 're gon na try and kidnap her . - Is there anybody you can send ? - We 'll take care of it . We got a number and an address . - Hello . Is this Lester ? - Hello . Who 's calling ? This is Sam Rothstein . I want to talk to Ginger . Put her on the phone .
zone1	very carefully . I want to talk to Ginger . I want my kid back . I want her put on a plane immediately . - I know she 's there . Do n't fuck around . - Sam , I wouldn't . - You should n't do this . - You understand ? Put her on the fuckin ' phone . Sam , I do n't know where she is . So ... Iisten - - Can I call you back ? - 702-472-1862 . - Mm-hmm . 1862 . - Okay , I 'll call you right back . - Right away . - Right back . - You got it . Schmuck . All right , I just bought us a few minutes . You want to get back at this prick ? Hmm ? - Okay , you got what ? Two million in that box ? Hey , you got a minute ? He 's got two million in the box , am I right ? You let him keep your jewels . We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about
zone1	. You dye your hair . I do n't want to go to Europe . I want to go to see " The Elephant Man . " We 're going to Europe . Let the adults talk . You dye your hair . You get plastic surgery like we talked about . You 're the mother . How much you think he 'll pay to get this kid back ? - I do n't want to go to Europe . - Shut your mouth . You know where she gets this ? - You shut up . You want me to come over there ? I 'll smack your face . Do n't give me your shit ! This has always been a dream , but now we 're going . - Lester , he called you here . He called you right here . - That 's who was on the phone . - I just talked to him . - So he knows where you are . That means he 's sending some guys over here , probably right now . It means he 's sitting by the
zone1	to call him back . - He 's sitting by the phone just waiting for you to call . What do you think we 're gon na do ? He 's probably got guys outside the fuckin ' house ! - This is fuckin ' bullshit ! This is bullshit ! - Get your bag ! Let 's go ! - Oh , what bullshit ? What ? You want to talk it over now ? - Okay , you done yakkin ' ? - Go , go ! Get in the car ! - Go , go , go . Just relax . Nobody 's killing anybody . I think he 's gon na kill me . - Just relax . Call me back here in exactly an hour on this phone . I 'll see what I can do . I 'm gon na call you back in an hour at this number ... - and you 're gon na be there , right ? - I 'll be here . Listen , do n't do anything else crazy , okay ? You all right ? Okay .
zone1	knock it off . - She started it . - She started the whole thing . I 'm just standing here . - Get in the car . You 're not gon na drive . Do n't even think you 're gon na drive . I 'm gon na drive . - I 'm not gon na drive with some crazy woman . - You 're driving me nuts ! Get on the passenger side ! And I 'm sending this kid to Bolivia in a box ! Can we -- - Ginger called me . - Yeah . - I just told you she called me . - What 'd she want ? She was afraid to call you . - She 's with that cocksucker . They got Amy . - That 's why I 'm here . She wants to come back , but she 's afraid you 're gon na whack her out . - They 're gon na kidnap my kid . What do you want ? - I know . Why did n't you come to me ? I mean , this is family
zone1	home . It makes us look bad out here . You know what I mean ? Back and forth , this one and that one . In the meantime , she 's gone anyway . - Am I right ? What am I going to do with this woman ? - Driving me fuckin ' crazy . - I think if you , uh ... assure her that she 's gon na be all right , she 'll come back . Driving me fuckin ' crazy . Once you get her here , you think about it . Wait ' til you get the kid back . She wants to come back . That 's the main thing here . You want your kid , do n't you ? Huh ? - Hello . Hi , it 's me . Just who you wanted to talk to , right ? Listen , I 'm not gon na ask you where you are . Just , please , put Amy on a plane , any plane , to get her here right away . - That 's all I 'm asking
zone1	n't think she should go by herself . What do you mean ? What I mean is -- Do you think if I came back -- Do you think you could forgive me ? I got ta tell you , I do n't know . I understand that . I know I fucked up . - What about the money ? Where 's the box ? - I got ta tell ya ... I made some mistakes , and I spent some money . - What 's it under ? - Pretty serious . - How serious ? - It 's under 25 . - It 's under 25,000 ? - Yeah . - The rest of the two million is still there ? - Yeah , I got the rest . Okay , no big deal . That 's okay . He got his 25 . That I 'll live with . Any more , I could n't . Okay . All right , all right . Where are you ? I 'll send a plane for you right away . Hi , Sam . So what 'd you
zone1	. He needed some clothes . 25,000 for clothes ? He wanted a watch too . - 25,000 for clothes and a watch ? - Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . - Good evening , signora . This way . - Geno . The good part was I had Amy back . So we went home , had the housekeeper stay over , put the kid to bed . I calmed myself down , and we went to dinner . I tried to keep things nice and civil ... but , hey , 25,000 for three suits ? That does n't make much sense . First of all , he 's not gon na wear thousand-dollar suits . Let 's say he did , which he wo n't . How you gon na get fitted for 25 suits in three days ? - I mean , how could you get fitted that fast ? I ca n't get fitted that fast , and I pay twice as much . - I bought him a watch too . - Yeah . But even if you bought him a really nice watch , one
zone1	what the fuck a good watch is . - Say you go five , ten , twelve grand ... - Yeah . at the most , which is impossible , for him . Plus , at the most , three suits , 1,000 apiece . That still leaves what ? - Around 10,000 ? - Would you knock it off , Sam ? - I 'm just trying to figure it out . - There 's nothing to figure out . I 'm home . We 're working it out . I 've been told before , " We 're working it out . " You think that you 're home ... after what you just put me through with Amy , is a favor to me ? So , counting the watch , let 's say another 4,000 ... for expenses over the weekend ... of which you must have had a good time . I know he did . That 's for sure . I know that fuckin ' piece of shit had a good fuckin ' time . On my money . You might as well have
zone1	're lookin ' at me a certain way . You 're teary-eyed , huh ? You 're upset . You 're a good actress , you know that ? Good fuckin ' actress . You can fuckin ' get that pity out of people . I 'm not a john . You understand ? You always thought I was , but I 'm not . And I 'm not a sucker . That fuckin ' pimp cocksucker . He 's lucky I did n't kill him last time . Lucky he 's fuckin ' livin ' . If you would have stayed with Amy ... and you would have ran away , he would have been fuckin ' dead . Both of you . Dead . Dead . ? Dreamin ' dreams of you Little babe ? ? No , it is n't right . It is n't fair . Yes . He does n't come home at night . What is the big fuckin ' deal ? I go-- Listen , I just ca n't fuckin ' take it . Why should I fuckin ' take it ? That
zone1	the only one around here with a fuckin ' past . He 'll never let me live it down . Well , yes , I have tried . Of course I 've tried . What the fuck do you think I came back here for ? No , I 'm not . I want to have him killed . Yes , I want him killed . I 've fuckin ' had it . So are you with me on this ? You want to get rid of me ? Here I am . Go ahead . Get rid of me . - Hello . - Yes , I do ! I fuckin ' hate you ! I ca n't take it anymore ! - Yes , I want to kill you ! I hate your fuckin ' guts ! - You hate my guts ? - I 'm sick of being with you ! - I want you to come with me now ! - Come with me now . Come with me now . - I want you out . I want you out of here . - I
zone1	of here ! Take your fuckin ' bag and get out of here ! I 'll go , but I want my money right now ! - You 'll get your money ! Do n't worry . - The arrangement is over . - No kidding ! - And I still get my money . I need some cash right now ! You ca n't just put me in the street ! You have n't been straight with me ever since I met you ! You never even loved me in the first place ! I need eyes in the back of my head with you , you fuckin ' bitch ! How could I love you ? You treat me like I 'm your fucking dog ! - You 're lower than a dog ! - Fuck you ! Here ! Here ! ls this enough money ? Will it last you two fuckin ' days ? Take it ! - Greedy bitch . Take the fuckin ' money . - I 'm going to the bank ... - and I 'm getting my jewelry too ! - It
zone1	down there to stop me ! I mean it ! I guarantee you , I will not stop you . You 're not getting rid of me with one fucking suitcase ! Come back tomorrow and get the rest . Just get out of here . Fine ! - I 'm taking Amy . - You 're not taking Amy . I am . I 'm waking her up right now . You 're stoned . You 're a junkie . Get out of here . - I am not ! She 's my daughter too ! - Get out of here ! Send my lawyers a letter , god-fuckin ' - damn you ! You 're not getting away with this ! You 're not gon na cheat me out of my end ! Fucker ! The funny thing was , after all that , I did n't want her to go . She was the mother of my kid . I loved her . And later , I realized I did n't want to give her the money ... because if I did , I knew I 'd
zone1	good day at school , okay ? - Okay . Okay , angel . From now on , I have to know where you and Amy are at all times . Here 's a beeper . I want you to keep it on you . It 's very light . So I can call you whenever I have to . Okay ? What are you supposed to do ? What do you want to do ? You want to stay the way you are ? You ca n't do that . Listen , two people do n't get along , at some point you got ta call it . It 's none of my business , but I think that 's what you got ta do . You 're right . I know . - I was just -- - What ? What ? - Nothing . - What were you gon na say ? - I do n't -- - Tell me what you were gon na say . - Yeah ? - Yeah . I was thinking maybe you know somebody at the bank ... who could help
zone1	of money in there . I 'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out . - Let me think about that . - Okay . Let me see who I got . Got ta get somebody I can trust , you know ? - You know he 's never gon na give me my jewelry . - Hmm . He holds that key so tight , he 's probably got it stuck up his ass . You 're right . That 's Sammy . And he 's probably got it there too . He 's so fuckin ' lucky . I could have buried him . I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby . - Then he 'd have tracked me down , and he 'd have killed me . - No , he wouldn't . - I would have . - He 'd have been right too . Seriously . - Come on . - You do n't take a guy 's kid and then take off . - I did n't . I mean , I did , but then I
zone1	I came back . - You did . You 're right . You did . I like that . - Exactly what you said . - That 's what I like about you . You did the right thing . - I did what you told me . - Yes , you did . - Because you always tell me the right thing to do . Yeah . He really fucked himself up out here , did n't he ? - He sure did . - Everything went to his head . - Changed . - Changed . - He did . He ai n't the same person . - No , he 's not . - He really thinks who the fuck he is . - Exactly . He hates me . He hates my fuckin ' guts . Come on , come on . You 're a toughie . You can take this . - Do n't cry . - I 'm not as tough as you think I am . Yes , you are . I 'm not , and he scares the shit out of me
zone1	do . - Come on . - Do n't be scared . - I need some help . I do . I need some help . You got ta help me . I need a new sponsor , Nicky . I do . I need a new sponsor . - Is that what you want ? - Yeah . - A sponsor ? - Yeah . Okay . Do n't worry about it . Nobody will fuck with you anymore . - I 'll take care of you . Yes , I will . - Take care of me . - It 's what you want , is n't it ? - Thank you . Yeah . - Yeah . Uh-huh . - It 's what you want ? - That 's Ace 's wife . - Fantastic . - This is great for the boss - Hi . - Hi . - You did n't answer your beeper . - I threw it away . You threw it away ? I tried to do this thing . I know that you want me to , but it 's just
zone1	' thing 's beep , beep , beep , beep , beep ! I 'm in a restaurant , it 's embarrassing . I do n't want to do it anymore . Where 's Amy ? - I put her to bed . - Oh . I got your cigarettes . Oscar wants you to call him . - So who 'd you go to lunch with ? - Jennifer . - Where 'd you go ? - To the Riviera . What 'd you have ? - I had a salad . - What did Jennifer have ? She had the same . Okay . I want you to call Jennifer ... and I want you to tell her to tell you what you had for lunch . I 'm gon na listen in on the other line . - Why do you want to do that ? - You know why . - Just do it . - Fine . I just need to get the bowl for my thing . The line 's busy . There 's nobody there . - Hello . - Hello , Jennifer
zone1	n't have lunch with Jennifer . - Okay . Who were you with ? I was with somebody . I know you were with somebody . Who was it ? I just hope it 's not someone who I think it might be . I just hope it 's not that . I knew she fucked around . She did what she did , and I did what I had to do ... but , Jesus , Nicky was the worst thing she could have done . What if he wo n't stop ? It could get us both killed . I can back him off . She was very convincing when she wanted to be . And this is how she backed him off . Hey , Ginger . Do n't forget , if you 're challenged ... if he asks anything , deny everything . You understand ? I do n't want him bringing beefs back home . That could really cause a serious problem . Got to be careful . He 's not dumb , you know ? You hear what I 'm saying , right ?
zone1	that . What ? Do you think I 'm stupid ? Do I think you 're stupid ? No . I think you 're beautiful . But I got ta go . By this time , Nicky had things so fucked up on the streets ... that every time Marino went back home , the packages got smaller and smaller . It got to the point , when he walked into the place ... he did n't know whether he was going to be kissed or killed . Frankie , I want to ask you something . It 's private . But I want you to tell me the truth . Of course , Remo . I want you to tell me the truth , mind you . I always tell you the truth , Remo . Frankie ... the little guy ... he would n't be fucking the Jew 's wife , would he ? Because if he is , it 's a problem . What could I say ? I knew if I gave the wrong answer ... Nicky , Ginger , Ace , all of them could
zone1	one thing about these old-timers . They do n't like any fucking around with the other guys ' wives . It 's bad for business . So I lied , even though I knew that by lying to Gaggi ... I could wind up gettin ' killed too . - No , I ai n't seen anything like that . - Are you sure ? I 'm positive . Remo , things are very fucked up down there . I know . That 's why I 'm asking . - You see , my main concern is Nicky . - Mm-hmm . I want to know if he 's doing all right , if he 's okay . - He 's good . He 's fine . - I 'm asking you to keep an eye on Nicky . - Do it for me . - No problem . I would n't want to be jeopardizing anything for our friends . Understand ? - I understand . - Okay . Frankie , you 're a good boy . Thanks , Remo . By now , Nicky and his crew had
zone1	. The booze , the coke , the broads . I mean , he got sloppy . He just was n't the same Nicky anymore . - You must have drank too much . - Go fuck yourself . One night he had to belt a guy three times ... before the guy finally went down . In the old days , Nicky would have decked him with one shot . You add this into the mix -- Maybe just Vegas got to all of us . His crew followed him right over the edge . They were all tuned up half the time on coke . They started doing stupid things . The worst was Blue . - Hey , what do you guys want ? - Police ! Stay in the car ! He never knew when to keep his mouth shut . - Drop the gun ! - Fuck you ! The cops shot Blue ... - because they thought his hero sandwich was a gun . - They could have been right , but who knows ? - Jesus Christ ! What gun ? He 's
zone1	do you want ? It 's pitch black . - Pitch black ! - It 's tinfoil . It looked like a gun ! - You fuckin ' moron ! - I 'll be fillin ' out paperwork for the next two months ! - What are we gon na do ? - I 'm sorry ! - You jerk-off ! To get even , Nicky 's crew got stoned one night ... and they started shooting up the cops ' houses . It got to the point where they could n't talk in the Gold Rush anymore ... because the Feds put a wire in the wall . Even when they talked outside , they had to cover their mouths ... - Shit , he 's covering up again . - because the Feds brought in lip readers . Nicky found out from a teller who owed him money . He asked me again about you and the Jew 's wife . Walk , walk , walk . What 'd you say ? He asked me again about you and the Jew 's wife . Yeah ? What 'd

There 's nothing we can do . - There 's nothing we can do . - Look , look , look . You ca n't stop her for speeding ? Look what she 's doing . - There 's nothing we can do . She had the keys . - She 's on the account . - Let 's pull her over at that Citgo station . - Okay . Let 's do it . - We 're placing you under arrest for -- - For what ? - We 're
zone1	For what ? - We 're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -- - But I 'm just trying to leave . After all the threats and all the bullshit ... it turned out Ginger did n't tell them anything . - But , by then , the Feds did n't need her anyway . - But it was mine . - They had all the pieces they needed . - But I did n't do anything . - Everybody began to tumble , one after the other , like dominoes . - F.B.I . ! We have a warrant ! Between Piscano complaining on the wire ... between Nicky , Ginger , me and my license -- - Paradise . We managed to really fuck it all up . - Mom . - Yeah , someone 's at the fuckin ' door now . F.B.I . We have a federal search warrant . I got wind of the pinches coming down , so I took off . Who needs to hang around for that bullshit ? - My name is Mark Casper . Special Agent F.B.I .
zone1	phone call ? - Hey , hold it a minute . You can make a phone call , but you do n't have to talk to us like that . Everybody , out of the room . Over to the alarm . They got almost everybody else . - This area is seized ! - Get the master account list . - I want all those papers seized regardless of what they are . Put every box on the table . Ah , yes . Here we are . Little craps figures . Green ? Do n't even ask . - $30,000 of yours . - No , he did n't . That 's why it was n't valid . I was being extorted . I 'm willing to tell you whatever you want to know . - I 've got nothing to hide here . - Now for the best . I could n't believe this shit . Piscano 's expense reports took the cake . - Oh , this is good . Bingo . - He might as well have given them a fuckin ' blueprint . Everybody
zone1	at this . Thank you so much , Mr . Piscano . How considerate of you . - Those are my mother 's books . - You 're under arrest . What a fuckin ' balloon-head . - What are you guys doing ? - Take it easy . - Wait ! - Wait a minute ! He 's sick ! Oh , God ! - Move back . - I think it 's his heart ! Oh , God ! ls he breathing ? - C.P.R . now ! Poor Artie . He got so upset , he had a heart attack ... and dropped dead right in front of his wife . - Calm down ! - Artie ! No , I wo n't calm down ! - He 's my husband ! Artie ! Artie ! - We ca n't help him if -- And at the end of the day ... they finally came to see me with the pictures . Why protect a friend who betrayed you like that ? But I did n't want to look at them . I did n't want to
zone1	Honor , as you can see , my clients are elderly and infirm . Any incarceration could pose a serious health risk . When the bosses were arrested , some of them were so old ... they needed doctors at their arraignment . Pre-trial Services recommends that bail remain as presently set . - We 're going to take a recess . - When it looked like they could get ... 25 years to life in prison just for skimming ' a casino ... sick or no fuckin ' sick , you knew people were going to get clipped . So , the day of the arraignment , they had this meeting right in the back of the courthouse . See , when something like this happens , you know how things are gon na work out . It 's always better with no witnesses . So what about Andy ? He wo n't talk . Stone is a good kid . Stand-up guy just like his old man . That 's the way I see it . I agree . He 's solid . He 's a fuckin '
zone1	Remo , what do you think ? Look ... why take a chance ? At least , that 's the way I feel about it . Call Artie . Tell him , I do n't care what ... - he 's got to be in my office Thursday morning before 11:00 . - It 's done . It 's terribly important . I got ta have a conversation with that guy -- As much as they liked him , I mean , he was n't one of us . He was n't Italian . As far as they knew , he could have talked . Otherwise , Stoney might still be alive . The first one to skip was John Nance . He found a nice , warm , secluded place in Costa Rica . - He thought nobody would find him there . But then his kid got nabbed by the Feds for drugs . So , naturally , the bosses were afraid he 'd come out of hiding ... just to save his kid and give them all up . So ... Where you goin ' , jag-off
zone1	. - Everybody went down . Fuck you . Before you knew it ... anybody who knew anything wound up gettin ' whacked . Oh , no ! No ! No ! After Ginger took off , she was n't much help to anybody . She found some pimps , lowlifes , druggies and bikers in L.A . In a few months , they went through all the money and all the jewels . After they found her body ... I had a private doctor do another autopsy . He said they gave her a hot dose . In the end , all she had left was 3,600 in mint condition coins . No matter what the Feds or the papers might have said about my car bombing ... it was amateur night , you could tell . Whoever it was , they put the dynamite under the passenger side . But what they did n't know , what nobody outside the factory knew ... was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver 's seat . It 's the only thing that saved my
zone1	suspect I know who lit the fuse . - Hey , Nicky . And so did the powers that be . - How are you ? - How you doin ' ? It took months for everything to calm down . But , finally , my guys got out on bail ... and the bosses wanted me to send my brother Dominick out to Vegas . Always the dollars . Always the fuckin ' dollars . I mean , it was still way too hot for me to even go near Vegas . So I set up a meeting with the guys way out in the sticks . I did n't want my brother to get fucked around . I mean , what 's right is right . - They do n't give a fuck about -- Holy fuckin ' ! What the fuck -- Come on , motherfucker ! - Tough guys ! You and your fuckin ' brother ! - You fuckin ' scumbags ! No more ! - Frankie ! - No more ! You see ? Watch ! - Frankie ! Frankie ! You piece of
zone1	' punk , motherfucker ! Piece of shit ! No , no , no , no ! Take this motherfucker out ! Frankie , leave the kid alone . He 's still breathing . He 's still breathing . Leave him alone . Frankie . All right . Strip him . No balls . You got no fuckin ' balls . Ah , Dominick . Ah , Dom . Dominick . Dominick . Dominick . Oh , Dominick . Come on , come on . - Bury them ? - Bury them . - The word was out . The bosses had enough of Nicky . They had enough . How much were they gon na take ? So they made an example of him and his brother . - They buried them while they were still breathing . Mister , you all right ? Watch out ! - Mister , you all right ? - Yeah . They had other ideas for me . We need some help over here ! - You sure are lucky , mister . The town will never be the same . After the
zone1	Today it looks like Disneyland . And while the kids play cardboard pirates ... Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and Junior 's college money ... on the poker slots . In the old days , dealers knew your name , what you drank , what you played . Today , it 's like checkin ' into an airport . And if you order room service , you 're lucky if you get it by Thursday . Today it 's all gone . You got a whale show up with four million in a suitcase ... and some 25-year-old hotel school kid is gon na want his social security number . After the Teamsters got knocked out of the box ... the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos . And where did the money come from to rebuild the Pyramids ? Junk bonds . Still not sure ? - Probable . Maybe questionable . Let me know as soon as you can find out . But in the end , I wound up right back where I started . I could still pick winners ...
zone1	people back home . And why mess up

zone1	na be here any minute . Okay . We 'll be right down . Father of the bride . I never thought I 'd say this , but that whole experience Pas a piece of cake ... compared to the roller coaster I 've been on this past year . I admit it took me a while to recover from the wedding , but eventually life got back to normal , which is exactly the way I prefer life to be . After the dust settled , I began to realize what a lucky guy I was . I had a wonderful home filled with memories , and completely paid for ; a wife I love just as much as the day I married her ; a daughter , independent , self-sufficient , married , working , happy ; a son blossoming in the middle of middle school ; and a son-in-law gainfully employed , and very often , out of town on business . Life was sweet . I felt for the first time ahead of the game . Then it dawned on me . I was a mere
zone1	a father with one kid married and the other off in college . And that started me thinking . What was I gon na do with all that free time ? Anything I wanted . Maybe I 'd take up fly-fishing , travel to exotic places , climb Mount Everest . I was feeling on top of the world . And that 's when they lowered the boom on me . It was like that old joke : " All those who think they have it made , take one step forward . Not so fast , George Banks . " It was about a year ago when it all started . Well , nine months ago to be exact . I was on my way home from work on a perfect fall day . The leaves were golden . The air was crisp . And I could n't help thinking what a charmed life I was leading . Yep , I was a happy man . Hey , hey ! - Hey , Dad , you hear the news ? - What news ? - I do n't know
zone1	phone ! - Got it ! - Who would n't tell you ? - Hey . - Hi , George . Do you think it 's what we think it is ? What ? What ? What is it ? Somebody tell me what 's going on . Bryan called and said to be here at 6:00 sharp , that he and Annie have some important news to tell us . This is one of those moments , George . I can feel it . Oh , my . Hi , honey . Oh , do n't worry , okay ? I 'm sure nothing 's wrong . - How do you know ? - Well , I , I know . - Oh , you know ? - No . I don't-- I do n't really know . I just know nothing 's wrong . Now , come on . Come on inside . - Can I fix you a drink , George ? - No , thanks . Nina , you do n't think Annie 's been transferred back East , do you ? No , honey .
zone1	. George . George . You sure you do n't want a glass of wine ? ' Cause she always said a transfer was a possibility . And I , for one , would hate it if they moved . Really , George ? You ? Well , they live far enough away as it is . Dad , they live a mile from here . Well , you know , with the traffic and everything . Oh , there they are . I just - - I just do n't wan na hear the word " Boston , " that 's all . I mean , you know what 's gon na happen , do n't you ? First , they 're gon na promise to come home for long weekends . Then it 'll be a week every other summer . Next thing you know , we 're strangers . We 're just names on a Christmas card list . We 'll be those relatives out in California . Bummer Man , he delivers . - Hello ? - We 're here . - Hi ! - Hello
zone1	- Good to see you too . - Hey , Dad . - Hi , son . There she was , my Annie . Every time I saw her , I had to remind myself she was a married woman . To me , she still seemed like a kid playing house . - Hi ! - Hi , Mom . - Hi , hon . - How are you ? - Good ! Are you feeling all right ? Of course she 's feeling all right . Look at her . She never looked better . - Hi , Dad . - Are you okay ? - I was a little late . So , any news at work ? Any-- Any news ? Any anything ? - No , everything 's great . Same , but good . - Same . - Busy . - Busy . See ? - Hey , Dad . - Hi . George . Sorry , George . As long as the big news was n't that my daughter was moving 3,000 miles away , her husband could call me anything he wanted
zone1	to grow somewhat fond of Bryan MacKenzie . Those hors d'oeuvres look so great . I 'm starving . Mm-hmm . So what is it , Annie ? What 's the news ? - Well , do n't you wan na eat first ? - Come on . Tell us . What is it ? - I know what it is . I got it . I 'm positive . - What ? You bought a house , right ? A place you can remodel a little closer to home ? - A house ? Is that it ? - Well -- Well , no , no , no , no . A house is fine . Oh , yeah , of course , a - - a house is definitely good . That 's the big news ? A house ? Man , I thought you guys were gon na have a baby . - Oh , get outta here . - Us too . I know . Me too . That 's what I thought . That 's what we were hoping for . - Well -- -
zone1	'm gon na have a baby ! - We 're pregnant ! - Oh ! - Congratulations . - Oh , this is so -- - Thanks . I never liked that Bryan MacKenzie . Not from the moment I laid eyes on him . Here my little girl was playing house , and he had the nerve to -- - George . - What do you say , Dad ? Congratulations . You too . Congratulations . - Oh ! - Grandpa ! " Grandpa " ? First that runt steals my daughter , now he makes a grandpa out of me . The baby is due July 26 , and I like that ' cause that 's a good even number . Of course , it is going to be very hot . But I 'm sure she 's not gon na mind . Oh , God . Oh , George . Can you believe the same doctor who delivered Annie is going to be delivering her baby ? - Oh , honey . It 's so amazing . - Yeah . Oh , George ! I have
zone1	shower for us ? - Franck ? - As a favor , honey . George . What ? I thought you liked Franck now . - I never actually said I liked the man . - Yes , you did . Yes , you did . When we were at that party with those people from whatcha-callit , - you were just raving on about him . - All right . Well , maybe it slipped out , but I did n't mean it . Nina , get a grip . I 'm not gon na go into hock ... to give Annie a baby shower . I just finished paying for the wedding . Oh , now my stomach hurts . Where 'd you put my Tums ? All right , honey . Okay . Okay , okay . It was just a thought . Calm down . What 's the matter with you anyway ? You did n't say a word during dinner . - You 're acting as if you 're not happy about this . - Who 's acting ? Oh , I see . You
zone1	having a baby ? That 's right , Grandma . I 'm not . - Why ? - Well , for starters , they ca n't afford a baby . - Oh ! Oh . - Babies cost money . And the older they get , the more they cost . I mean , they did n't plan for this . They do n't have a nest egg . They-- They barely have a nest . How are they gon na fit a baby into that shoe box they live in ? Really , George . They have more money than we had at their age . Also , what do they know about raising a kid ? Annie 's just a kid herself . I mean , she graduates college and marries the first guy she meets . And now to get saddled with a baby even before her career takes off . Why must I always be the only feminist in this family ? You know , I just realized something . I 'm four-foot-six . I do n't shave . I do n't have a job ,
zone1	there somethin ' weird about that ? Finally , someone who thinks like I do . Oh , yeah , a 12 year old . Hello ? Oh . Sally ! Oh , Sally , hi . I have the best news . Guess what . This is so exciting . I 'm gon na be a grandmother . - Poor Nina . The woman was obviously living in denial . - Yeah . I know . - I , for one , was n't ready to be a grandfather . - I know . Yeah . What was so grand about it anyway ? George ? Oh , he 's thrilled . - Grandfathers wore cardigans and hearing aids . - In fact , um , I was just telling him that ... - I wore baseball caps and running shoes . - the same doctor who delivered Annie -- Sure I may have been a little out of shape , but I was still young . And I could prove it . Oh , yeah ! Oh , yeah ! Oh , yeah ! Oh , yeah !

My , my , my . This is a new and improved George Banks . Hey , hey , hey . Did n't we just pay 900 bucks to have this roof fixed ? I swear to God , this house is starting to fall apart . First , the heating went , then the gas thing broke and the plumbing froze . I do n't know , sometimes I , I think I would just like to wash my hands of this whole thing . George , what is it ? What-- What are you thinking ? - I have a brilliant , beyond-brilliant idea . - Uh , yeah ? - I say we sell this dump . - Right . - I 'm serious . - George , what ? Are you crazy ? Honey , last year you said you wanted to be
zone1	you wan na sell the place ? Nina , listen . Matty 's in school every day ' til 6:00 . You 're at work . I 'm at work . You know , let 's get rid of it . Let 's not be so by-the-book , you know . Let's-- Let 's be adventurous . Let 's loosen up . I do n't know . I mean , if we sold the place , then we wo n't have room for the baby . What " we , " kemo sabe ? It 's not our baby . lt does n't need its own room in our house . - Well , what about Matty ? - Oh , like Matty would n't love living at the beach ? The-- Oh ! The beach ? Mr . Sunscreen ? Please , George . I mean , now you wan na live at the beach ? Hey , you 're the one who always said that one day before you 're old you wan na live by the ocean . - I know , but -- - I 'm
zone1	. You know , we could sell this place in a second . I mean , it 's the Leave It To Beaver house that everybody wants . You know , we 'd have enough money to buy a condo . You know , we could get a boat . We could travel . And I could get that Harley I always wanted . Harley ? Honey . Oh , George . This has been a very big day for you . First your hair , and then this , uh , thing . I just-- I think we should think about things , okay ? Okay . But will you think about it , really ? - Well , will you wash that stuff out of your hair , really ? - Yeah . Okay , I 'll make ya a deal . - Okay ? - Mm-hmm . If one more thing goes wrong with this house , we 'll put it up for sale . You have my word on it . As luck would have it , termites attacked two weeks later . So we decided
zone1	got any nibbles . Four weeks went by and not a single nibble . All right , here we go . Here we go . Here . - Check . - Ball in . Come on . Let 's go . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? Hey ! Where you going ? - Spin move . - Whoa ! Hey ! What ? Hey ! - Come on . No . No ! - Yes ! Then one Saturday morning , we got a bite . A big bite . George , I 'd like you to meet Mr . and Mrs . Habib . Hello . How do you do ? Nice to meet you . This is my son Matty and his friend Justin . - We like house very much . When you can move out ? - Excuse me ? The Habibs would like to buy the house , George . It 's exactly what they 've been looking for . Yes , when you can move ? We need house a week from Wednesday . And my wife wants flower
zone1	top dollar . - For the house , top dollar ? Dishes . For the dishes . For the house , we pay what you ask and no more . But we need house a week from Wednesday or no deal . Gee , that 's , uh-- That 's ten days from now . That 's kinda quick . We 've lived here 18 years . I do n't know if we can get every -- Excuse , please ? Uh , you explain that I pay big money if he sell now . Very big bonus . Mr . Habib is willing to pay a generous bonus ... for whatever inconvenience moving too quickly may cause you , George . Dad , you better discuss this with Mom . - How generous ? - Would , uh , $15,000 be generous enough ? - We may be making real estate history here , George . - Oh , yeah . One , two , three thousand , four , five , six , seven thousand -- I shook the man 's hand and promised to be out in
zone1	was , I did n't have the nerve to tell Nina . Wonderful champagne , George . Dom Perignon . What are we celebrating ? I know . That 's what I was wondering . What are we celebrating , dear ? Well , it 's just the first time the whole family 's been together since the baby and everything . - Oh . - Oh . - Oh , honey . - Thanks , Dad . That 's sweet . Oh . So tell us , have you thought of any names for the baby yet ? Well , if it 's a boy , we like Cody , Cooper , Riley or Wyatt . - Wyatt ? As in Earp ? - Yeah . - Y-You do n't like it , Dad ? - Well , I like it better than Cooper . - Or Riley . - Hey , what if it 's a girl ? For a girl , our favorite name is Chloe . - Chloe ? Ooh . - Chloe ? It 's not even American . Th-Thank you , Matthew . We
zone1	. And we 're still debating between Lucy and Fanny . Y-You 're not considering any family names ? Yes , is n't the first son supposed to be named after the paternal grandfather ? Well , he does n't have to be named John , of course . Any name on my side will do . We have an Andrew in the family . A Melville . A Jacob . Uh , Jake is a great name . Hey , you know what . They do n't need any more suggestions . Their list is fine . You 're absolutely right , George . Anything is fine as long as it goes with MacKenzie . Uh , wait a minute . I thought the baby 's last name was gon na be Banks-MacKenzie with a hyphen . - Was n't that the deal ? - Would you like to go through life ... with the name Cooper Banks-MacKenzie ? Kid 's gon na sound like a law firm . It 's an awfully long last name , George . Hold on . What are we saying ? You 're
zone1	this happen ? Nothing 's been decided yet , Dad . It 's just that ... we think two last names is a lot for a little kid to deal with . And since neither of us want to forfeit our names , we 've been coming up with alternative last names . Your baby 's gon na have an alternative last name ? Like , what , Smith or Jones ? - No . - No , because you ca n't make Smith or Jones from the letters of our last names . - Right . - So -- - I do n't understand . What names can you make ? Well , the one's we like best are Zineman , Zenkman and Mannis . Oh , my . Are you telling me I might have a granddaughter named Sophie Zenkman ? - Yeah . - Look , look . I have a simple solution here . George , Nina . You already have Matty to carry on the family name . So , why do n't we drop this Banks-MacKenzie business and ... just go with MacKenzie ?
zone1	, now would n't that be silly ? Well , I do n't think that 's any sillier than dropping the Banks . - Well , I would venture to suggest that MacKenzie ... - Well , I do . - is a good , solid family name . - I mean , traditionally , you take -- I mean , the baby 's just as much a Banks as it is a MacKenzie , is n't it ? - Traditionally -- - Dad , say something . - I just do n't agree with that . - Change the subject . - MacKenzie is -- - Hey , guess what . I sold the house today . - What did you say , dear ? - Nina , I forgot to tell you . While you were at the market this morning , I sold the house . Well , congratulations , Gramps . Where are you movin ' ? Well , we do n't know exactly for sure where yet , but , uh , we 're thinking of maybe the beach . - We do n't know
zone1	, George , we have n't even started looking . You sold the house ? Dad . - Why is she crying ? - Well , because I never thought ... they were serious about selling the house . I 'm sorry , Dad , but I just thought it was another goofy idea like your hair . - Hey . - I never thought you were actually gon na go through with it . - I love this house . - Well , wow ! I guess I just assumed we 'd have a little more warning . But what do we have ? We have at least 90 days before we have to move . Am I right , George ? Oh , believe me , Nina , you can jack up an escrow six months , if you need to . - Matty , what 's going on ? - May I be excused ? No . No , sir . You may not be excused . - George ! - The guy paid me $15,000 extra to be out in ten days . The guy paid
zone1	ten days ? - I hope you took it , George . - He did . - And he threw in Mom 's favorite dishes just to close the deal . - George ! Nina was less than thrilled about our abbreviated escrow . But being the great woman that she is , she went with the flow ... and even allowed me back into our bedroom for our last night at 24 Maple Drive . And since we had nowhere to live , she also arranged for us to stay at the MacKenzie 's ... - while they took a Caribbean cruise . - Honey . Honey , are you sure you do n't want me to take your picture by your favorite part of the fence ? No , no , I 'm fine . Oh , okay-- Oh . Whoa . Hey , Nina , are you okay ? I mean , you do n't look so good . I know . I do n't really feel so good . I-I just did n't think I 'd get so emotional about this whole thing . I do
zone1	guys , these are from the tree that we carved our initials ... - in out back . - Oh ! - Here . Here . - Oh ! Oh , Mom , did you get a picture of the tree ? - Oh , just a roll , honey . - Okay . - Oh . - Hey , Matty , what 's that ? - My doorknob . I want to keep a memento from my room . - Oh ! - Oh ! Hey , what are we , the Schmaltz family ? Come on . No more tears . We 're on to bigger and better things . I mean , who needs this old shack ? Look at it . Dad , there 's one more thing we have to do before we go . I 'm not gon na dig up that parakeet from the backyard . That 's not what I was thinking . How many times do you think we 've played out here ? About a thousand . - I remember our very first game . - Me too . -
zone1	. Here you go . You had a red ribbon tied in your hair . Dad ! Look , Dad , I can dribble . Watch . That 's my girl . That 's my girl . Hey . Sorry to interrupt . Oh , uh , hi . - You got the key , George ? - Yeah , I-- Uh , I have it right here . Uh . I got it . I know I have it . Oh , uh , Mr . Habib , this is my daughter Annie . Uh , she had her wedding here at this house . Ah , yes . The key ? Oh , yeah . I got it . Somewhere . Did I give that to you ? Ah , okay . Oh , sorry . So , well , here you are . And , uh , here you go . - She 's all yours . - Good luck , Banks . Uh , you too . Well . - Ah , what perfect timing . We were just about to depart ourselves . - Hi
zone1	hurry ? - Oh , not at all . No . We have plenty of time . - Oh , thanks so much . - Welcome . Come on in . - Oh , it 's our pleasure . - Welcome . Welcome . Make yourselves at home . - Come in , please . - Are you sure ? - Where 's Matty ? - Oh , he 's sleeping at a friend's . - I 'll tell you what . The dog food 's ... - all in the refrigerator and marked . - That 's nice . - Uh , uh , you remember the dogs , of course ? - Yeah . Yeah . - Fortunately , they forgot you . - Oh . Come here , you angels . I 'm gon na miss you guys . - See , George ? They 're completely harmless . - Mm-hmm . Get ahold of yourself . Now , listen , I want you to pay attention ... to your Uncle George and your Aunt Nina now , all right ? Bye , fellows . Oh ,
zone1	- John ! - Wow . - All right . - We 're off . - Well , good-bye . - Oh ! Oh . - Oh , well . - That 's what the limo was for . - Help yourself to anything you see . We 'll call you . - Got the tickets , honey ? - They 're all yours . - Thanks . - Okay , bye-bye . - Enjoy . - Thanks so much . - I 've got everything , sweetheart . And when you get through with that limo , send it back for us . Oh . Oh , George . Honey , do something . They look sad . Hey , guys . Do n't worry about a thing . - Uncle George is here -- - Oh , George . All right . Now , just take it easy , guys . He 's not gon na hurt you . - Cute . Cute . - Well , as it turned out , the dogs did remember me . Hey , puppy , puppy , puppy . It was
zone1	of us in the old MacKenzie mansion . Hey , listen to this . Luxury beach condo . Marina views . Stroll along winding streams past lush landscaped gardens . Honey , are you sure you did n't pack the Pepto-Bismol ? Why ? You still feel sick ? I ca n't seem to shake this thing . I just do n't feel right . You just need a good night 's sleep . That 's all . Tomorrow -- - Oh . - Tell ' em to get off . Okay , come on , guys . Get off . Let 's go . Off . Come on . Off . Come-- Oh , forget it . I gotta-- I got ta lay down . Just come on . Let 's move over . That 's a good dog . Oh ! What am I supposed to do ? Sleep standing up ? I do n't know , honey . Just push ' em off . All right , boys . Hey , come on , come on . Now , now , fun 's over . Let 's

Off ! - Oh . - Get your filthy paw off my wife , you good -- Oh , forget about it . It 's their house . Let ' em have the bed . I'll-- I 'll go stay in one of the other seven bedrooms . Oh , but , honey , I do n't wan na be left alone in this big room . I do n't feel good . Fine . I-I 'll sleep on the floor . Huh ? Thanks . Oh , I know . I have an idea . What if after they fall asleep , you just lift them off ? Oh , yeah , of course . I 'll just lift ' em off . What are you , nuts ? - Could you hand me a pillow ? - Yep . Oh , I 'm so
zone1	me . What ? What 's wrong with you ? It 's so obvious . I do n't know why I did n't realize it before . Honey , I 'm going through menopause . Oh , Nina . You ca n't be going through menopause . My mother went through menopause . Well , exactly , and probably at my age . George , I have all the symptoms . I 'm late . I 'm weepy all the time . I 'm hot and dizzy . - Do n't be silly . We 're still so -- - But , George , honey , we 're not . We 're not as young as you think we are . Just because we 're getting older , it does n't mean that we 're old . This is the ' 90s . Growing old is n't what it used to be . Well , it 's true . Women my age are doing Geritol ads and Fixodent commercials . - Nina . - They are . And guess who I saw on the cover of Longevity magazine . -
zone1	The Mod Squad ? This is reality , George . Do me a favor , will ya , honey ? Stop acting like this is n't happening . - Oh , do I have to ? - Yes ! Yes . George . George . You have n't been the same since the day you found out Annie was pregnant . Now , I know you , and I know it takes you a long time to work these things out . - But I miss the old George . - Must you use that word ? All right . I miss the adorable George Banks I used to be married to . Honey , you got me worried . I do n't know . You dyed your hair . You sold our house . - What 's next , a 19-year-old girlfriend ? - Nina ! Well , men do those kinds of things , George . They do n't wan na grow old with their wives , so they get-- I do n't know . New wives . Young wives . Just -- - Nina . - What
zone1	my hair , and I may wan na move to the beach and ... - Yeah ? - I may hate the idea that I 'm gon na be a grandfather , but never for one millisecond of one day ... did I ever not wan na spend the rest of my life with you . - Really ? - Really . - Really ? And I 'm sorry I 've been such a jerk . - Oh , that 's okay . I 'm used to it . - Yeah . - Good night . - Good night . The doctor did n't give you any indication of why he wanted me to come with you ? - No . - But he did n't say there was anything to be concerned about ? No . I mean , I assume this is absolutely routine . I do n't know , honey . I 've never been through menopause before , you know . He probably just wants to tell us what to expect un - - well , unless -- - Unless what ? What ? Unless what
zone1	up on my blood test that was too horrible to tell me over the phone , and he wanted you here for support in case I flipped out . - You know , and he just , like -- - Nina , well , what did the man say exact -- - Well -- - What were his words ? - Just that ... he thought it would be wise for us to come in together as soon as possible . That 's all . Okay , here we are , honey . I 'm sure I 'm gon na be fine . I hope . I 'd never seen Nina so unglued . I was n't used to being the calm one . I did n't know what the doctor was about to tell us . But nothing , absolutely nothing , could 've prepared me for what I was about to hear . - It 's gon na be all right . - I know . Nina , George . - Well , we ran a panel on Nina 's blood . - Nina . - What ?
zone1	know I 'm here for you . - And you can count on me . - Okay . We 're gon na get through this together . - Okay ? - Okay . So , uh , tell us . Uh , what is it ? We can handle it . - What 's wrong with her ? - Nothing . Nothing that wo n't go away in nine months . Kids , you 're gon na have a baby . - Excuse me ? - Nina 's pregnant . - Oh , my God . - Pregnant ? - And who , may I ask , is the father ? - George ! Do n't " George " me , you two-timing Mata Hari . I swear , we have n't done it in six weeks . I have n't just felt myself lately , but pregnant ? How could this happen , Nina Dickerson ? Why are you calling me by my maiden name , you big jerk ? And , what do you mean we have n't done it in six weeks ? What about that little
zone1	was a stupid nothing . I mean , that was a moment of pure insanity . Would you like to know how many moments of pure insanity ... I 've delivered over the last 20 years ? Phil , look at me . I 'm about to be a grandfather . Things like this do not happen to men my age . Come on ! Picasso had children well into his seventies . Ah , well , you know , Picasso . I mean , Picasso . I mean , there-- He 's the one guy in history who had kids into his seventies . But , you know , he 's an artist . He can do anything he wants . I 'm just-- You know , I 'm just a , a regular Joe . You know , regular Joes do n't have , have babies at my age ! You know , I was-- I was just adjusting to being a grandfather ! Preg -- Oh ! Oh , my God ! - All right . Here you go , Mr . Banks . - Oh ,
zone1	, wait a minute . - Here . Let me help . I 'll help . - I 'm okay . - You okay ? - I 'm okay . - Let 's see if you got your sea legs back yet . - Sorry about that . I 'm just , uh -- - The shock . - I know . - Anyway , thank you . - Uh-huh . Bye-bye . - Thank you . - I know , honey . Me too . I just-- God . I ca n't believe it , huh ? Yikes ! Well , you do n't think he could be like , you know , wrong or something , do you ? I do n't think he used a home pregnancy test , George . No . Honey , this is definitely like I'm-- This is happening , George . I know it 's a lot to deal with , but we 'll just - - we 'll just let it sink in , all right ? - Good idea . - Okay . Mom 's the word , huh ?
zone1	? Oh , man . This was a life curve I was not ready for . " Grandmother Has Baby . " It was like a National Enquirer headline . One would have thought nothing on earth could have topped this moment . - Wrong again . - It 's the musk oil smell that scares me . - Oh , well . - Oh ! - Oh , my God , the Banks ! - Oh , my gosh . And my favorite father of the bride . - Hi . How are you ? - Hello ! - Great . Wonderful . You look wonderful . Mr . Banks . - Oh . Look at you ! - Chop , chop , chop . Oh , you look beautiful . - How are you , sir ? Imagine running into you here of all places . This is our home away from home . Well , I am always fixing , you know . A nip , a tuck , a little suction . You know , I look in the mirror and I say , " Hello
zone1	, I valet park , and bongo , Cher Bono . So how ' bout you ? Nothing is wrong , I hopes ? Your health is good ? - Oh , yeah , yeah . We 're - - We 're good . We 're perfect . - Oh , yeah , it 's good . It 's great . - We 're healthy and , uh , nothing to report . - Very healthy . - Nothing at all . - Great . - Oh , well . - Oh . - Mrs . Banks . - Huh ? - You forgot your prenatal vitamins ... and all your pamphlets on becoming a mommy again ... - and the ultrasound photo . - Oh . Your baby 's first picture . - Oh , no . - Baby 's first picture ? Do n't -- - Do n't tell me you are pregnant ? - No ? - Yeah . I am . - Oh , my God ! - I know . I just found out . Oh , I love that so much ! Mother of
zone1	! - Oh , mazeltov , Mrs . Banks ! - And guess what . - What ? - Annie 's pregnant too . - Oh , no ! - I did n't hear that ! Mother and daughter are pregnant together ? Oh ! That is fabulous ! I love that ! That 's chic . - I think I 'm gon na faint . - He did . This is what I suggest . You must let me do the baby shower . - Howard , hands me the book . Quick . Quick , boy . - Oh ! No , no , Franck . Not this time . No more parties . No way . N-O . You never wants to have fun , George . And you never change . Every party has a pooper That 's why we invited you - Party pooper - Party pooper Every party has a pooper That 's why we invited you George Banks - That 's you - It was on the second chorus ... of " Every party has a pooper " that I got woozy again
zone1	town . Nina was glowing . She looked so peaceful . Grab your coat and get your hat Leave your worries on the doorstep - You ca n't get me ! - Just direct your feet - Slow down , son ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Wait , son ! - Whoa , whoa , whoa ! - To the sunny side of the street Can you hear the pitter-pat - Yeah , that happy tune he 's whistlin ' - George ? - Nina ? - Honey , I need to know how you feel about all this . - Life can be so sweet - Dad , I want a hot dog ! - On the sunny side of the street - They do n't have any hot dogs ! They do n't have hot dogs ! - I do n't like -- Do n't ! Josh ! No ! No ! No ! I feel super about it . I 'm totally up for it . - You are ? - Definitely . Oh ! So what do you think ? You think we have
zone1	mean , honey ? For the actual pregnancy ? - Well , I know I have the stamina for that part . - Oh , well . That 's a relief . I 'm talking about the rest of it , like the next 18 years part . But , George , for weeks you 've been telling me how young you are . - And you 've been telling me how old we are . - Well , we 're obviously not too old , honey . Well , Nina , let 's be honest . I mean , just because a man wears sneakers , it does n't make him a teenager . I was completely kidding myself . When I was working out at the gym , there were 60 year olds more buff than me . Oh , so we 're too old for this . ls that what you 're trying to tell me , George ? No , it 's just that I was beginning to feel like we were approaching ... that big parenting finishing line . Now to be all the way
zone1	we will be like the oldest parents ever at the starting gate . I mean , let 's face it . Between us , we 're almost a hundred years old . But do n't get me wrong . I 'm into it . 3:00 a.m . feedings and diapers and car seats and Mister Rogers and vomiting . - Hi . - Hi . Hi , sweetie . Hi . - Hi . - Hi . - Hi , guys . - Hi . - Hi . - Everything go okay ? Oh . Oh . So what 's going on ? What 'd the doctor say ? Is that , uh , TV still on the blink ? Because I have time now , I -- - Dad . - Okay . - Well , he , uh -- - Mom , you can tell me . I 'm a big girl . Well , honey , as it turns out , my , my blood tests are fine . - Good . - Yeah . And I 'm not even going through menopause . - I thought
zone1	well , I do n't know . So what is it ? Did he find anything ? Well , actually , he did , did n't he ? He did find a little something . He did ? What ? Believe it or not , your father and I -- - We 're going to have a baby . - We 're pregnant ! You guys ! That is so unfunny . I mean , can you imagine if that were true ? I mean , you could n't be . You 're serious ? You 're really pregnant ? I 'm due September 4 , Labor Day . Perfect timing , huh ? Labor Day . You know , we should go now . - Mom , you 're pregnant ? - Well , honey . It 's not something we planned . Sometimes these things , they just happen . Who knew ? You know , it was a rainy afternoon . And , uh , your mom and I were all alone in the house . Then , uh , one thing leads to another . And
zone1	Daddy ! - At that moment , I wanted to crawl under the sofa and die . You old son of a gun . " Son of a gun " ? I wish I had a gun . If it was n't for this kid coming into our lives , none of this would ever have happened . - It 's okay . - Gee , I do n't know what to say . - That 's okay . - I just never thought we 'd both be pregnant at the same time . - Yeah , well . - I 'm not crying because I 'm sad , really , because I 'm not . - No . What's-- Well -- - I got ta get a Kleenex . Annie ? Oh . Annie , don't-- Do n't cry , honey . She 's been kind of emotional lately . So , our kids will be what ? Not brother and sister . That 's wrong . Oh , no , no , no , no . Their kid will be your brother or sister and our kid 's
zone1	. Yeah , but our kid will probably be more comfortable calling us Grandma and Grandpa ... just like your kid , you know , at least in front of his friends . You know , ' cause let 's face it . We 're gon na be in our fifties when he 's in preschool . In our sixties , when he graduates college . But , you know , that 'll be great to see another kid in cap and gown , you know , if we can still see by then . Now , at least going to the movies , that 'll be economical . " One child , two seniors . Thanks . " Kid 's gon na love spending his adolescence in a retirement home . At least he wo n't have to worry about us hearing him come in late . That 's right , honey , because we wo n't be able to hear , right ? Exactly . You 're so hilarious , George . You 're so hilarious . You 're so sensitive . And I really appreciate you asking
zone1	... I 'm the one who 's going to be having the baby . You 're right . How do you feel about it ? I know how old I am , George . I 've already been the mother of the bride . But here I am at the age I am , and I 'm pregnant . And , you know , I do n't think that qualifies me for the Guinness Book Of Records , George . So in answer to your question , I 'm very happy ! I 'm happy and I 'm feeling nervous ... and I 'm just very much alone . Well , anyway , good-bye , sweetie . I 've got ta go . Yeah . And thank you so much , Bryan . Thank you . Thank you . Do me a favor . Do n't follow me , Banks ! No ! I went after her , but it did n't do much good . I called her , but she refused to pick up the phone . Calling me " Banks " was never a good sign .

zone1	You did n't ask . - I did n't ask because it just never entered my mind . But since you obviously do n't want the house , I have the perfect solution . Sell the house back to me ! I still have your check here in my wallet . - I never even cashed it . - I do n't think so , George . See , I demolish house , build two in its place . This a great piece of land . Mr . Habib , this is not " a piece of land . " This is my home , and I 'm gon na be a father again ... and I do n't want to bring my baby home from the hospital to a condo on the beach . I wan na drive down that street , and I wan na pull into this driveway , and I wan na honk my horn -- Yes , yes , okay . I know . Mr . Habib , please . You see this pathway ? I laid these bricks with my own two hands .
zone1	. I broke that window with a frisbee ! I painted these shutters . Do n't bulldoze my memories , man . I 'm begging you . Sell me back my home . Boy . For how much ? You wan na make a profit on something you owned for one day ? Yes ! Fine . Will $5,000 do the trick ? George , just another day ago , I turned down profit of 50,000 on lot . Now , you want to double that , I consider selling back . You want me to take out a loan on something I owned free and clear just 24 hours ago ? Well , that is up to you , George . Your path , your fence , your memories . You do n't know what you 're asking , sir . I am the cheapest man alive . Then move aside , George , ' cause I going to level the place . We go to work ! Come , come ! Go , go ! - Commence to start ! - Commence to start ! - All right
zone1	win . One hundred thousand dollars . Very close shave , George . Yes , make out , please , to the Habib Group . - Habib Group . - Inc . - Inc . - Very good . - Welcome home , George . - It feels good to be back . Well , I happy I could help . Mr . Habib , just one last question . Would you mind getting your wrecking ball off my lawn ? Oh , sure . Anything you say , George . You 're the boss . - We go . Move out ! - That 's right ! I 'm the boss ! So all you guys , get a move on ! - Get that dump truck out of here ! - Right away ! - And quit standing on my shutters ! - Sorry . And all of you guys , just pack up your stuff and hit the road ! And do n't trample the pansies . I laid those bricks , I planted those pansies , I painted those shutters , I broke that window !
zone1	I did was apologize to Nina . That is not funny , George . I 'm not gon na listen to you . Then I told her I bought the new baby a present . - That did it . Twenty-four hours later , we moved back home . - George ! Before we knew it , it was spring . - Here you go . - Everything was in full bloom , including the women in my life . Hello ? Oh , hi , honey . - Baby 's been kicking a lot . - Annie and Nina were in their second trimesters . - There was no denying it now . - Yeah , I know we ca n't sing . The stork was not only on his way , he was circling the neighborhood . Still trying to redeem myself , I did the unthinkable . I hired Franck to surprise the girls with a double baby shower . - It 's a baby shower ! Oh ! - Hello , ladies . What dreams are made of ! Look what I have for you !
zone1	! topped off by two surprise guests flown in for the occasion all the way from Vienna . - It 's a stork ! - Oh , my God . - After the shower , - Thank you . Nina was showing a few of her friends the new baby 's room ... and Franck started giving decorating tips . But this is what I suggest . Firstly , if it were me , you know , what I would do is I 'd push those windows out and let sweet San Marino light fill in . Therefore , the third trimester in the Banks family began ... with a remodel of what we now affectionately called " the baby 's suite . " I 'll admit we got a little carried away , and it was n't even all Franck 's fault , although God knows I tried to blame him . - Hey ! Hey ! - No , no , no , no ! Nina and Annie were doing great , right on schedule ... and weighing in at 128 and 132 pounds respectively . Ohh !
zone1	're expecting : leg cramps , backaches and cravings . And the women were worse . What we did n't expect one sleepy night ... was an unexpected visitor . - Oh , hi , Dad . - You okay ? I 'm fine . Bryan and I got in a fight . And I got angry and got in my car . I did n't know where to go . - Did I wake Mom ? - No , no , no . She 's asleep . So , do you wan na , you know -- Yeah , sure , I can talk about it . It 's not , you know-- It 's fine . - ' Ca-- If you do n't wan na , it 's okay , ' cause I could just make up the sofa . - No , no , that 's - - it 's okay . Thanks . - Pretzel ? - No , thanks . All right . Here 's what happened . When I was leaving work today , my boss calls me in , tells me what a
zone1	as much promise as anyone she 's hired since she 's been at the firm . Then she said the great part . She said that she 's been asked to select ... one person from my level to be part of a design team ... that 's gon na design the new Boston Museum of Contemporary Art , and she picked me . - That 's fantastic . - I know . I was completely thrilled . Plus , to live in Boston . I love Boston . - You have to , uh -- - Move to Boston . Yeah . I need to be there right after the baby 's born , by October . - Uh-huh . - I knew when they hired me ... that this was a possibility one day , and Bryan knew it too . But now , well-- I rush home to tell him the news , and as soon as I say the word " Boston , " his face drops . I mean , this is the kind of opportunity everybody dreams about , and we 're talking Massachusetts
zone1	na go ? Well , he said that he understood that career-wise it was great for me , but with the baby coming , he figured I would n't wan na go . - Which is -- - Ridiculous . - Right . It 's like under that mellow , ' 90s Gap ad exterior of his ... beats the heart of a 1950s husband that just expects me to take a backseat to his career . - You said that to him ? - Of course . To which he said I was nuts , and that all he meant was that with us having a new baby , it just seemed like a crazy time to move to sub-zero weather and a city full of strangers , and that I should think of you guys ... and of his parents , and how moving so far away would be so hard on everyone . Anyway , I knew if anybody would understand how I felt , it would be you . You were the one that always told me to go for my dreams , never to settle
zone1	to want to go ? Because if you think I am , I wo n't go . I wo n't . Ann , you have to go . This is not the Dark Ages . We 'll still see each other all the time . You 'll just be an airplane ride away . That 's exactly what I said . And was n't Bryan the one who said you were a gifted architect ... - and he 'd move anywhere you got a job ? - Yes . And would n't you move for him if he was the one being offered the promotion ? In a minute . Oh , gosh , that must be him . - Hi . - Hi . Hi , Dad . Um , Annie , I-I realize that - - that -- Did you tell your dad ? Sorry , George . I did n't mean to be so lame . Hey , you guys go ahead . It 's not up to me . Okay . Annie , I realized after you left that , uh , if the same thing
zone1	, anywhere . - I would . - So I wan na do the same for you . - God , honey , I am so sorry l -- - Oh . I just do n't want you to ever resent me for this . Hey , I can work out of Boston just as easy as I can work out of L.A . And I do n't want you to ever resent me , ever . - Okay . So then we 're goin ' . - Okay . The baby has hiccups . - Oh , yeah . - Did you feel that ? - Yes . Boston . As I watched the kids pull out of the driveway , I got an all-too-familiar pain in my gut . The one I always got when I did something for one of the kids that fell under the heading of , " I did it for their own good . " And then I thought about baby number three ... and 25 more years of moments like this . And suddenly , I was tired . I 'll be
zone1	can . All right . lf it swishes , no problem . Father of the Year . Not swishes ! Just goes in ! Well . - Oh , it 's frying ! - Well , we made it to July . The Farmer 's Almanac said it was the hottest month L.A . had seen in over half a century . - Did you see it ? - Nina was four weeks from her due date , - and Annie was two days past hers . - Howard ! Howard ! Franck and his crew were working around the clock to have the baby 's room ready by D day . Life was hectic , - especially once Annie moved in . - I better go . Bryan was called to an emergency meeting in Japan , and since Annie 's doctor assured us ... that the baby was at least another week away , - Bryan took the red-eye to Tokyo and left Annie in our care . - Bye . So there I was , living with two extremely pregnant women ... - during the worst heat
zone1	Annie and Nina dealt with the heat by adding extra air conditioners to the house , turning our home into the only igloo in San Marino . - How we doing , girls ? - Good . - Dad , would you mind ... - adjusting the pillow behind my back ? - Sure , sure . - Yeah . George . George . - Oh , thank you . Prop that pillow up under my foot , would you please ? - Here we go . Here we go . - Thank you , honey . - Lemonade ? Thank you , yes . Oh , and George , - would you please scratch my left ankle ? - Mm-hmm . My mission was to keep them calm and comfortable . I tied their shoes , massaged their backs , painted their toenails ... and went to every imaginable take-out restaurant in the city . Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Got ta go get dinner . - Matty , hold down the fort while I 'm gone . - Okay , Dad . George ! Turn the air
zone1	in here . Oh , boy . Uh , now , you all have my beeper number just in case . - Shut the door ! - Shut the door ! Here we go . Here we go . Dinnertime . Dinnertime . All right . - Thai noodles with chicken , white meat only . - That 's me . - Oh , yeah , Annie . - And let 's see . - Uh , Taco Grande . - Mm , honey . Yes . - Extra rice , no beans . - Ooh . Mmm . Thank you , honey . - All right . Uh , lox , bagels and cream cheese . Thanks , Dad . All right now . Where 's Dad 's ? Where 's Dad 's ? As the days rolled by and nothing happened , the tension mounted . I found myself watching Annie as if she were a time bomb . - Ouch ! - What ? - What ? Ouch . O-U-C-H . - Oh ! - Hey , good word . - Honey . - Ohh . -
zone1	our clothes so we could grab them in a hurry . We were like firefighters ready to jump at the first alarm . Okay . Okay . I 'm hot ! - Good night . - Good night . It 's about that time . - George ! - All right , everybody stay calm ! - Okay . Okay . Now , I 've mapped out the various routes to the hospital . We can , uh-- Oh , it 's just , uh -- What , uh , what time is it ? It 's , uh-- All right , it 's 11:36 . 11:36 . All right . So that would be 11:36 . Plan " F , " uh , route " B . " We can be there in 17 minutes . Annie , do n't worry . We got everything under control . What is this ? What am I wearing ? My blouse . - Oh , honey ! - What ? What happened ? - Oh , my God . - Sorry . False alarm . - Oh , sweetheart . -
zone1	right . - Do n't worry about it . - That 's okay . - I 'm sorry . - That 's not unusual . - Are you okay ? - Do n't worry about it . - That can happen . We 'll be back before you know it . We got home just as the sun came up . The girls fell right to sleep ... as I headed off to work . Hello ! It 's fabric day . - Hello , George . - Hi . - A pleasure to see you . And oddly enough , knowing Franck was at the house made me feel better , although I have no idea what he did there all day . Do the baby workout Make the babies gleeful Oh , that 's good . That 's good ! Little tin soldier Happy tin soldier Right . And now with an attitude . Hello ! Who you ? Get away ! I do n't like what you say ! Now , leg up -- Uh-oh . Mom ! Dad ! - I 'll get it .

You know , I think-- Oh , boy , I think I just got ta -- - I 'm gon na lie down here just for a sec . - Oh , me too . I 'm gon na go catch a few winks before I -- Dad , where 've you been ?

Honey , dinner 's ready . - She cooked ? - She wants to give you a break . She 's been cooking up a storm all day in that freezing kitchen . What 's the matter , George ? You look a little pooped . Oh , I have n't slept in three days . You know , I try to sleep at work , but I keep thinking any minute one of ' em 's gon na go into labor and I 'll just end up -- Totally wired . Trust me . I know the feeling . And do you know how I spell relief ? V-A-T-S-N-I-K . - V-A-T-S-N-I-K ? - Vatsnik . The best sleeping pill in the whole wide world . I swear by them . Oh , no , no , no
