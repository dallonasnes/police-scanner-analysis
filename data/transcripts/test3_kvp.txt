I believe Jesus was very fond of their company , but of course he and Joseph were only carpenters , not nearly such fine folk as we . If you 'll excuse me , I have somethings to see to before we go up to dress . We dine at 8:00 . [Indistinct_conversations] You are a minx , Lady Gresham . [Chuckles] Granny : she 'd worked so hard ... to bring these people to Green Knowe , and they patronized her from the moment they arrived . I 've changed my mind . I 'll wear the Rose taffeta tonight . Ma'am . Keep the blue silk for tomorrow . and the rubies ... the one's in gold filigree , not the diamond setting . Yes , ma'am . [Water_sloshing] Oh , my heaven ! Madam , come quick ! Aah ! Tolly : Caxton was the thief . He decided to steal them
zone3	wanted to stay on . Well , they shredded his room . They never found a thing . And then it was too late . [Indistinct_conversations] [Indistinct_conversations] [Laughter] Granny : Maria should have canceled the rest of the party , But the crime had to be dealt with , and the guests were reluctant ... to embark on another long journey at once . All of which meant that 2 days later , 14 of them sat down to dine . Your loss has n't spoiled your guests 's appetite . We all know there 's pleasure in a friend 's misfortune . The Germans even have a name for it . Perhaps you can win something back tonight ... with a little luck . [Chuckles] In truth , I do n't feel very lucky this evening ... In anything . I 'm told we 're all to be questioned tomorrow , And all the servants . My maid is beside herself . It seems rather unnecessary . But perfectly thrilling . Our poor hostess is a specter at her own feast . I 'm relieved to know ... something
zone3	her a little ? It 's hard to pity a woman ... who cares more for her jewels than for her child . What is it , Caxton ? Caxton , what 's the matter ? I 'm sorry to have to tell you , madam , But ... the house is on fire . What ? ! [Conversations_stop] [Fire_crackling] What 's that noise ? Your Lordship , do n't ! Oh ! You , man , open the window ! [Women_screaming] Northwood ! Gresham ! get outside and help the ladies ! Quickly ! Jonathan , help me ! Ohh ! Thomas , help me . [Indistinct_shouting] Mrs . Oldknow , I hate to hurry you , But I really do think ... we 'd find it more congenial on the lawn . [Glass_breaking] Get out of my way . [Birds_squawking] [Wings_fluttering] " Susan by Jacob . " Robert : Arthur , George , the house is on fire ! Wake all the men ... and bring all the buckets you can lay your hands on ! The house is on fire ! - Jacob ! - man #2
zone3	get all the buckets we can , lads ! Jacob , wake up ! Jacob ! What is it ? what 's happening ? - The house is on fire . - what ? Look ! Susan ! [Indistinct_shouting] Lord Farrar : the servants know the house better than we do , So leave them to rescue the contents . Are there any sacks and buckets to be had ? Robert : Fred Boggis has gone to get some . What 's happening ? We can slow it up if we form a chain to the pond ! Then we shall have to hold it back as best we can ! Why is n't anybody doing anything ? ! Man : come on ! hurry up ! quickly , quickly , lads ! Ma'am ! ma'am ! Oh , I 'm mad ! I should have told the men to take the Vermeer ! Caxton , Caxton , can you see if ... Lord Farrar : Where you going ? Over here ! Quickly , come on ! Susan ? where 's Miss . Susan ? Where 's the child
zone3	in the house ? No , no , no , she ca n't be . she wo n't be ... Well , then where is she ? I do n't know . Sefton will know . Have you seen Susan ? Where would Nellie have taken her ? I do n't know . Find Mrs . Gross . Find Mrs . Gross . Lord Farrar : Come on ! Hurry up ! Oh , no ! Why are they bothering with that for ? ! It 's not worth the canvas it 's painted on ! You come with me . Did anyone bring out the bowls ? ! Nellie . It 's Nellie . Have you seen Susan ? [Cryng] I was in the kitchen when it started . Somebody told me she 'd come down . Stop that . Just tell me where her room is . I know . Get a ladder , somebody ! No , lady . no one could climb a ladder through that . Well , a blanket , then . We can hold both ends and ... I know a way .
zone3	can ! I know how ! Mr . Sefton taught me ! Robert ! did anybody save the plates in the dining room ? Mr . Caxton had most of it in a sack , But I 've not seen him since . [Indistinct_shouting] [Coughs] [Coughing] [Fire_crackling] [Grunting] Whoa ! Aah ! Susan . Jacob , is that you ? It 's me . Oh , I knew you 'll come . I knew it . Well , I did n't , but here I am . Are we going to die ? you can tell me . I do n't mind , now you 're here . We 're all gon na die , but if it 's the same to you , I 'd rather it was n't right now . But the window wo n't open and the door 's stuck ... and I can feel the heat on the other side . Just do what I tell you . Come on , now . get in there and climb . [Grunting] Wait for me and do n't move . [Both_coughing] Aah ! Let 's go .

Put your foot here . I will . You 're almost down . [Coughing] Mama ? Woman : Look ... It 's Miss . Susan . Man : he 's saved Miss . Susan . - man #2 : Good lad ! - man #3 : Boy 's all right ! Maria : Susan . Susan , my darling . Well done , guv , well done ! [Coughs] By George , that was a good night 's work , young man . You should be proud of yourself ! [Coughs] Thank you . % % for he 's a jolly good fellow % % for he 's a jolly good fe ... [Thunder_crashing] [Laughter] Thank you , Lord . thank you . Tolly : what happened to Caxton ? Granny : Fred Boggis saw him run upstairs with a sack . Maybe he got away with the jewels
zone3	seen again after the fire . And did Maria come to love Jacob ? Well , she was always kind to him after that . [Clock_chiming] If you 're going to have a bath before dinner , you better go . - Granny ? - hmm ? Why are you called Mrs . Oldknow ? If you grew up here , should n't you be Mrs . something-else ? Your grandfather and I were second cousins . So , you 're more of an Oldknow than anyone . You must have thought you 'd always live here . Well , if I did , I should have realized ... there 's no such thing as " always " ... Not on earth . [Birds_chirping] It 's the table center for Christmas day . Is it worth it , Going to all this bother when it 's just us ? Ca n't have Christmas without doing it properly . Even in wartime ? Most of all in wartime . News . [Radio_tuning] I wish it 'd just stop ending and just end . Shh , shh , shh . Man :

It wo n't be long . we 're nearly there . ... when faced by a common enemy . If you were a prisoner in Germany ... and no one knew where you were , I think you might be released now . ... when they invest and capture the city . at home ... Why not see what Boggis is up to ? Lovely day . Shame to waste it . ... and so well against the devastation ... visited on them by the German bombing ... [Door_opens] I know what you 're thinking , but you 'll see . ... they had conferred on the city , the queen replied , " it is we who are honored to be here . " Do you have a holiday at all ? Plants do n't know it 's Christmas , do they ? But you 'll take Christmas day itself off , though , wo n't you ? [Sighs] I shall go back
zone3	enough . What about Mrs . Boggis ? wo n't she be lonely ? That 'll be soon enough . [Knock_on_door] Telegram for Mrs . Oldknow . Thank you . [Birds_squawking] Shall I wait for an answer ? No . no , do n't wait . [Door_creaks] [Fire_crackling] Telegram . What rooms did they make the music room from ? Two downstairs rooms , I think , with some little bedrooms above . Low servants ' room , but they give it a fine , high ceiling . Tolly : is that narrow one the music-room chimney ? No . no , no , that goes up through the main stack , With one from the great hall . Well , what is it , then ? Why , leftover from before the changes , I suppose . Too much trouble to take it away . Granny : Tolly ! Tolly ! Tolly ! Come . come . It 's a telegram from your mother . She 's coming down to see us . When ? Tomorrow . Is she staying for Christmas ? I do n't know . you
zone3	. " Why do n't we ring her ? I 've tried . there 's no reply . [Chuckles] Well , whatever it is , She obviously does n't want to say it over the telephone . At least we have n't long to wait . Mrs . Tweedie : you 'll be glad to see your mum . Oh , I got something for you . Thank you . Heard how yours was lost . I 've been thinking some more about the jewels . Oh ! You and your questions . Did Maria just give up ? 742 [Chuckling] Oh , not a bit of it . This is absurd . Without my jewels , I 'm a prisoner to the end of my days . Just to accept that would be absurd . [Dog_barking] [Horse_snorts] [Birds_chirping] [Horse_neighs] I want to learn If I can recover my ... I know why you 're here . You must embroider a picture of the house . The thing is , I am rather busy . Surely if I ask my maid ... You must embroider the house . Oh .
zone3	hair . How perfectly disgusting ! Taken from the heads ... of everyone who was there on the night . How could I ? We were 14 at the party , and I 've no idea ... Not just the guests ... the servants , the guests ' servants , The villagers , whoever came to help , everyone . Well , that 's impossible . The hair will tell you where the jewels are to be found . Even if I do this , would I know how to read it ? That I can not tell you . Seems a lot of nasty work for a very uncertain result . I have no other answer . But why does it have to be me ? Because , Mrs . Oldknow , You have overplayed your hand . Tolly : How did Maria get all the hair ? With a lot of difficulty . The word went ' round . In the end , everyone helped , except Lady Farrar . She refused , point-blank . So , what happened ? Her husband found some on her hairbrush .
zone3	still exist ? Yes , it 's that one , there . Which is Susan 's ? Oh , hers is easy . ' Cause it was long , Maria used it for the trees . And Jacob 's ? [Chuckling] Well , his was short . In the end , she sewed that little bird with it . See ? [Chuckles] But it did n't deliver the jewels ? Five generations of Oldknows have stared at that picture ... and never found the clue . Maybe it was a trick . Of course it did n't work . Caxton 's was missing . Without his , the picture was n't finished . No , it was . He 'd given a lock of hair to someone he was keen on . Maria ? Oh , certainly not ... a housemaid . Why did you say that ? No reason . Anyway , Maria used it for a chimney . I think It 's that one there . There was n't much of it . come on . Into bed and do n't read too long . You do n't
zone3	Granny ? - hmm ? Can you be nice to her when she gets here ? Please ? Oh . You make me feel rather ashamed . Of course I 'll be nice to her . ' Cause we all love dad , do n't we , all three of us ? I know he 'll like it ... if we 're all getting along when he comes back . Yes , of course he would . I think she 's found him . I think she knows where he is . We must n't raise our hopes up too high . I do n't think my hopes could get any higher . No , nor mine , really . But ... But what ? No , never mind . never mind . We 'll cross that bridge when we come to it . - Tolly ? - yes ? If you have children , do n't ever quarrel with them . No matter the reason , no matter how angry you get ... Do n't quarrel . I promise you ... it 's never worth it . You do
zone3	world ? Except for daddy . Except for David . I 'm glad . Good . Because I would n't want there ... to be any confusion on that score . Good night . Night . [Bird_caws] Granny : Maria used it for one of the chimneys . Boggis : Low servants ' room , But they give it a fine , high ceiling . Fred Boggis saw him run upstairs with a sack . Maybe he got away with the jewels , maybe not . Get out of my way ! Do n't go up there ! That staircase is going ! You wo n't get back ! Tolly : Of course . [Breathing_heavily] [Grunting] Thank you for helping us with Fred . I do n't know what we should have done without you . I heard he was all right . Oh , yes , he never left Green Knowe . He married a kitchen maid ... Rose . I though the might . [Gasps] [Breathing_heavily] He ca n't hurt you . Did he start the fire ? He meant to start it in revenge and go .
zone3	, And then the gold . He 'd gone back up to hide it in the chimney of his room ... When the fire took him , but nobody ever knew . You know . I know now . You 're looking for the one behind you , The one with the rope . The next one serves the music room , but you want the disused chimney beyond that arch . It 's blocked by the new ceiling below . Thank you for helping us . Thank you . [Grunting] [Clatters] [Gasps] Tolly ! What on earth have you been doing ? You 've got to come to the music room now ... quickly . - Come on . - what are you doing ? What have you been doing with yourself ? You 're black ! How did you find it ? Susan helped me ... And the picture and Mr . Boggis and even you . That does n't look like much . But these ... these are our silver plates . Look . Look ... there 's our crest . [Gasps] Oh , Tolly . Fetch
zone3	look ... It 's Maria 's necklace , The one in the portrait . [Gasps] Oh , my . Rubies . Oh ! Oh , Tolly . Does it suit me ? [Both_laugh] Oh , look ! [Chuckling] I 've never seen so many jewels ! What do you think ? [Chuckles] Try this . Look at all these bracelets . [Chuckles] Oh , my ! [Chuckles] Oh , look at the rings . Oh , Tolly ! [Laughs] Ouch ! So , Green Knowe can be saved and everything put right ? It can . It most certainly can . You wo n't sell all the jewels . [Chuckles] Do n't worry . You will not blush for your mother or your wife . [Chuckles] What is it , Tolly ? I 've been thinking about ghosts . Do n't they come back ... If they come back ... as they were when they died ? I 'll just get started on the washing-up . Oh , thank you . well ... Do n't they ? Well , no , not always . But as a rule , yes
zone3	afraid I do . It 's true . they died . As children ? Well , It was n't unusual then . What did they die of ? It 's hard to say . No doubt something a pill would cure in a week today . Together ? Well , Susan went first ... And Jacob just a few hours after , With the Captain holding his hand ... and crying his eyes out , poor man . But that makes it bearable . Do n't you see ? Those children were both truly loved . So they 're not sad . And it 's our job not to think of them as sad . [Sniffles] [Birds_chirping] Jacob : what 's the matter ? Nothing . [Both_laugh] Race you back to the house ! That 's not fair ! I was n't ready ! [Both_laughing] [Vehicle_approaching] What 's that ? [Car_door_opens] [Birds_squawking] It ca n't be . [Crying] Oh , Tolly . [Crying] Oh , my dear . [Crying_continues] There . Come . Let 's go inside . Tolly , come on . Let ... let 's all be together
zone3	that you ? David ? Do n't worry . You 're gon na be okay . I promise . Now , come on . The old girl 's right . You 'll find she often is , you know . So , let 's all be together . Oh , Tolly , dear , let 's go inside . - The End - - -

Well , do the teachers seem good ? I guess . Any potential buddies ? Nope . Glasses over there . You 're still furious about the move . Yup . Oh , honey , we had to move here .

That was pretty good ... for a group of pansies ! Give me four laps , then hit the showers ! Move it ! I 'm a frigging receiver . What do I got ta run for ? I already ran 20 laps before practice even started . I think it 's something about shared pain and team spirit . I got team spirit coming out my ass . I ai n't got ta run . I have to save my energy . I have a hot date tonight . Tiffany ? No . Rhonda . But I thought Rhonda was going out with Joe ? She was . Man , you 're incredible ! How do you get away with this shit ?

You 'd probably like that , would n't you ? Oww ! I heard her mom 's a dyke , which explains a lot . What about her dad ? Probably a dyke , too . A dad ca n't be a dyke , stupid . I do n't think she has a dad . Just two moms . All right , that 's just weird . No . Two women ? That 's hot . Ugh ! You 're so gross . Come on , I feel sorry for her . That 's got to be hard .

Tru , why do you think the Montagues and Capulets hated each other so much ? Um , it was n't ethnic or religious , so my guess would be economic . They were probably in competition for something . Servants . Good help is so hard to find ! Tru has got a good point . While there were many reasons for families to feud ... Attention , students . Mrs .

Then you can find a nice black girl to date . Oh , Gran . Now , you see , that is your fault . You are just too pretty . You have spoiled me for all other black women . You little charmer . Get out of here . No sense in keeping her waiting . White girls ai n't got no patience . So , what 'd you think ? It was good . Funny . Nah . The book was better . You read the book ? It is possible to play football and not be a total moron . Sorry . I did n't mean it that way . So , how are you enjoying our fair city so far ? Agoura Heights is not a city . But it 's okay , I guess . I mean , it just sucks having

Well , then , what 's the problem ? He 's gon na think I 'm a dork if I 'm like , " Yeah , you have to come over and meet my parents . " Tell you what . You can roll your eyes and tell him what squares we are . That 's the time-honored way for kids to deal with this sort of thing . Right . So deal with it . We 'll wear our best overalls and tool belts just to impress him . That 's probably exactly what he 's expecting . Oh , well , good . Then it 'll be an educational experience for him . On an historical footnote , more and more things are being found out ... found out about ... excuse me ... the Montagues , uh , specifically

Are you kidding me ? That guy was on fire ! I know ! I could n't believe he got off that last throw ! There were , like , five guys rushing him ! Ahem . Hey . Oh . Wow . You look great . Thanks . Whew . Well , I guess we should get going . Oh , yeah , yeah . Have fun . And remember , be home by midnight . Oh , yes , Ma'am . Ma'ams ! Yeah . Why did n't Tru tell us ? Well , maybe she does n't know . I mean ,

I know it 's hard to tell with guys , but did n't your gaydar go off ? You know me . Unless they 're wearing a feather boa or humming a Judy Garland tune , I do n't have a clue . I 'm telling you , that boy is as queer as a three-dollar bill . Well , if he 's gay , why is he taking out our daughter ? Okay , fine . Maybe you 're right . But let 's stick to the subject . What subject ? The boy is black ! I do n't think an interracial romance was done so badly by you . Besides , if I 'm right about this boy , ai n't gon na be much romance . Sorry about my parents . Despite being gay , they 're actually kind of old-fashioned . Nah , it 's cool . They seem nice . I told
zone3	're like , " He 's taking you out . That 's dating . We want to meet him . " So ... are we dating ? Do we have to label it ? No ! Of course not . I just want to know what to say to all the other guys who are asking me out . Hello ! Paging your sense of humor ! Are we going into the city ? I should have told my moms . What they do n't know wo n't hurt ' em . I know it 's kind of goofy , but I do n't lie to them . It 's kind of a deal we have . That 's great . Would n't work with my family . Why not ? They do n't really want to know how things are . They wan na hear what they wan na hear , so that 's what I tell them . But then they never really know who you are , do they ? Guess not . Do n't you want them to ? You 're a great guy . Maybe
zone3	think so . The real you ? Please do n't tell me you 're an axe murderer now that we 're speeding away from home at 70 miles an hour . We 're only doing 65 .

It sounds great , but were n't those expensive ? Hey , we 're worth it . Do you guys know each other ? What ? That guy . Oh . No . I was thinking he could , you know , take our picture to commemorate the occasion . Do you mind ? - Uh ... Okay . - Just press it . Smile ! - Good . - Okay . Thanks . You 're welcome . She should be home by now . She 's not late yet . What ? I do n't like this . Is it possible that I 've lived with you
zone3	racist ? I 'm black . I ca n't be a racist . That makes no sense . I 'm not a racist . It 's just that I grew up with boys like that . " Boys like that ? " Do you even hear yourself ? I do n't trust him . I 'm telling you , this boy we can trust with Tru . Where I come from , black boy , white girl , that spells trouble . So did a black woman and a white woman , but that never stopped us . Yeah , well , we were in San Francisco . So , we 're here now , are n't we ? Look , Tru is gon na make her own choices , and she 'll have to deal with the consequences . That is life . She 's just a kid . We still get to make some of her choices . In case you had n't noticed , she 's a 40-year-old caught in a 16-year-old 's body . Sometimes I think she 's smarter than both of us . Combined

How 's life in the boonies ? Boring . Tedious . Just fine . Listen . I need some advice . Dom , alert the media . Our teenage daughter actually wants our advice . It 's about a boy , right ? What else are we experts on ? He seems to really like me . He 's just amazingly sweet . He took me to see " The Marvelous Wonderettes " last night . Can you believe it ? Gay . So gay ! - What was that ? - Oh , nothing , sweetie . Go on . Anyway , I know he likes me , but he has n't even kissed me yet . And last night , I thought I felt this weird vibe between him and this other guy .
zone3	to put this delicately ... He 's gay , Tru ! Gay , gayer , gayest ! Hey , babe ! Come on , sit with us . Okay . Come on . Hey , move out the way . Hey . Hello . Whatever you do , do n't eat the mashed potatoes . They 're like library paste . Thanks for the tip . I was n't even tempted . Hey , guess where I took Tru over the weekend . Went to the city . We had a blast , did n't we , baby ? Wow . That sounds romantic . Why do n't you ever do anything romantic ? ' Cause you ai n't my girlfriend , woman . You and me just having fun . Ah , ha , ha ! He told you ! Not that much fun . You tell him ! Ah , hell , no . Okay , you see what 's happening here , right ? You 're making me look bad . That 's not exactly difficult . Okay , see , now , you 're just ...
zone3	'll put it down if you put it down . I 'll put it down if you put it down . - Down . - Say my name . Say my name ! Do you need a time-out ? I think you do . Wait till practice , Lo . You know , it 's cool of your parents just to let us hang like this . They trust me . I thought you said they were old-fashioned . I meant for leftist dykes from San Francisco . Can I ask you something ? Yeah , sure . Have you ever been attracted to a guy ? What ? You know , ' cause it 's okay if you have . I had a crush on this girl back at my old school . It never went anywhere , but ... Wait , are you trying to tell me that you 're gay ? No ! No , no . I ... I 'm just saying that it 's okay to have feelings that people , you know , who are uptight might label a certain way . What are
zone3	right ? And , you know , we 're kinda going out , so I figured ... Okay . Okay , truth time . Why did you just kiss me ? What do you mean , why ? Why do boys kiss girls ? I 'm not asking about boys . I 'm asking about you . I just felt like it . To prove something ? Lo , it 's okay . It 's going to be all right . I got ta go . Lo , do n't run away ! Look , I 'm not trying to insult you . I ... You do n't know shit ! And you better not be spreading lies about me . What the hell is wrong with you ? Look , I 'm just trying to get you to admit what we both know . You 're gay ! Big fucking deal ! I ai n't even trying to hear this shit . ? This is the season The sign , the song ? ? Givin ' the reason That you need to hear ? ? The past has been
zone3	say it all now ? ? Do n't turn ... ? Tru , what happened today ? I do n't wan na talk about it . Did he try something ? Because I will kick his ass ! No ass-kicking is required . Believe me . Well , he did something to upset you . I told you , I do n't wann ... I 'll get it . Um , is Tru here ? Tru , it 's Lodell . Um ... I 'm so sorry . It 's okay . I 'm your friend . You do n't have to hide from me . It 's just , um ... I do n't ... want to be ... gay . As near as I can tell , we do n't get to choose . Yeah . Just kinda sucks , you know ? It 's not that big a deal anymore . Maybe not where you come from , but where I 'm from , there 's no such thing as a black gay football player . Most black folks I know think being gay is some sort
zone3	! I mean , what about James Baldwin , Langston Hughes , Bayard Rustin ? What football team do they play for ? Well , you do n't have to tell anyone till you 're ready . You wo n't tell ? Of course not . It 's your business . I love you , Tru . As a friend . Yeah , I know . Story of my life . Bye , Mom . Thanks for the ride . Have a good day , sweetie . Hey , guys , how you doin ' ? Hey , Tru ! How 's my girl ? Oh ! Whoo ! Fine . I 'm fine . Oh , look , she 's shy . Oh , so sweet , mama . You 're so sweet . You know , you should try out for the cheerleading squad next year . You 'd be great . - I do n't know about that . - Look , look . What you looking at , faggot ? - You trying to check out my ass ? - He did n't do anything .
zone3	is ? It 's a free country . Be grateful you have an ass someone wants to look at . That boy ai n't gay , else he be checking out my ass . Checking out your ass ? Please . Your ass ca n't hold a candle next to mine . Yeah , well , I never tried putting candles up my ass , gay boy ! Yeah , right . Try a lot of kickin ' . Hi . We were never properly introduced . I 'm Walter . Hey , I 'm Tru . Do you need a ride ? My car 's right around the corner . Sure . Uh , thanks for saving my life , by the way . That may be a bit of an exaggeration , but you 're welcome . So , are you gay , or is just your boyfriend gay ? You shut up . Who 's incredibly hot . I know . My luck . So , you knew . You ca n't tell anybody . No problem . It 's the least I can do for my
zone3	big deal . It was to me . I 've been pushed around for as long as I can remember for being a sissy . But a guy like Manuel , he could break every bone in my body before any one of the lunch ladies would say " boo . " You ca n't be the only gay person on campus . I mean , maybe we just need to raise awareness . " Be Kind to a Queer " Week ? Or a gay-straight alliance . You 're serious ? Why not ? Other schools have them . Who 'd come ? I do n't know . Would you ? Hell , yeah . Everyone knows I 'm gay , anyway . It 's right there on my web page . Then there 'd be two of us . You 're gay . I 'm straight . Let 's make an alliance . So , what was that all about the other day ? What ? You mean with the gay guy ? No , I know what that was about . I meant with me , before
zone3	. Lo , I said I would n't tell anyone . I did n't say I 'd be your Katie Holmes . Look , everyone thinks we 're a couple . If we do n't act like a couple , they 'll think we broke up . It feels wrong , like lying . Tru , come on , you are my girl , just not in the way that people think . It 's not my fault if people make assumptions . This is it . Are you sure it can support our weight ? Yeah , I 'm sure . And we 're not gon na get in trouble ? Nah . This house has been abandoned for almost a year . It 's really cool . Um , yeah . It 's like my own secret hideaway . I come up here when I need to think ... or sing . Sing ? Sing . Well , I mean , no one can hear me up here . Last summer , I treated the squirrels to the entire score of " Evita . " I was better
zone3	if people think we 're a couple ? You have no idea . It 's like I do n't have to waste time and energy proving how normal I am . Then , I guess it 's worth it . Maybe someday you 'll sing for me . Maybe . ? Scarecrow ? ? Can it be who you longed to kiss ? ? Scarecrow ? ? That left you Hanging here like this ? ? Oh , who you 'd yet to hold ? ? In dreams you left untold ? ? Scarecrow ? ? I know you ? Good practice , guys . - Thanks , Coach . - Thanks , Coach . Lo , your new girl , she 's waiting for you outside . And , boy , is she something else ! Yeah , Lodell 's gon na get himself some meow tonight . Come on , come on . Settle down . You 're only gon na last a minute . I did n't for your mama . I watched you guys practice . You 're really great . Oh . Thanks . No
zone3	playing to ... pass . But you really like it , do n't you ? I love it . Okay , I know you 're not supposed to like football and musical theater , but I do . I guess I 'm kind of weird . You 're great . And who knows ? Maybe you 'll be the first guy to write a Broadway musical about football . Come on , Lo ! You can do better than that ! Oooh ! That boy do n't need no practice ! Ha , ha , ha ! Come on ! So , you see , Mr . Velasquez , we really believe that a Gay/Straight Alliance would be a good opportunity ... You 're Gertrude Spivey-Johnson , the new girl . Yes , Mr . Velasquez . But people call me " Tru . " Yes . Well , Gertrude , I do n't disagree , but there are procedures that must be followed . You 'll need permission to use a classroom after hours . Only registered clubs can use school facilities . Right . All flyers and posters
zone3	course . And you 'll need a faculty advisor . Mrs . Muller ! No . Definitely not . Got ta go . Very busy . Very busy . If you want to have this meeting next week , as you say , I suggest you get right on it . Good morning . Come on ! Oh , yeah , bitch ! I wonder what it 's like in there . Boring , I 'm sure . Hey , sorry to bother you , Mr . Bushnell . Do you have a minute ? What 's on your mind ? Walter Amherst and I are in the process of starting a Gay/Straight Alliance , and we were told that we need a faculty sponsor . I was hoping that maybe ... What ... ? What made you come to me ? You 're my favorite teacher . Oh . Thank you , Tru . You 're an excellent student , and I really enjoy having you in my class . I wish I could help you . I really do . But I have to think of my reputation
zone3	Uh , Marjorie Lewis , the drama teacher . She 's married with two kids , and everyone knows she 's a liberal . Thanks . I 'll talk to her . So , you see , we really think , um , that a Gay/Straight Alliance would be ... Gay/Straight Alliance ! Give me that . I say we rock this joint ! Can you believe this crap ? Yes , I can believe it . I 'm helping organize it . It 'd be great if you guys could come today . If the cool kids show up , it will be ... Oh , no , no , no . No cool kids are coming to this thing . - This ai n't okay . It 's jacked . - Wait , wait , wait . I might want to go . Me too . Whatever . Y'all just messing with me . Everything 's not about you . I just do n't think it 's right . God did n't make Adam and Steve . Who made all the gay people , then ? You think
zone3	? I do n't know who made ' em . I ai n't no theolo-magician or whatever . All I know is that shit ai n't right . If God 's gon na punish gay people , then they they certainly do n't need any additional crap from you . Why ca n't you just leave ' em alone and let them live their lives ? God ! Shut your mouth ! What ? Oh , now I ca n't express my opinion ? Excuse me for speaking my mind . I better make sure she 's okay . Oh , Lo , let her go , bro . Are you okay ? Tru , why did n't you tell me you were gon na do this ? I did n't think you 'd want to be involved . I do n't . You ca n't either . Excuse me ? What are people going to think if my girlfriend 's running the gay club ? Gay/Straight Alliance or GSA . Yeah , whatever . People are gon na talk . Maybe they 'll think I 'm an enlightened person
zone3	you 're really worried about is what they 'll think about you . Look , for the first time in a long time , I just , I feel kind of safe . It 's like I do n't have to watch every word , every move . I 'm happy that our friendship has nice side benefits for you . But making you feel comfortable is not my number-one goal in life . I know . I 'm ... Okay , so do n't give me crap about this . You 're never gon na change people like Manuel , you know . Look , you 're entitled to choose your own friends , but I 'm not having lunch with him anymore . He 's obnoxious and crude . Maybe he does n't hurt your feelings , but he hurts mine . Of course he hurts my feelings . So say something to him ! Tell him he 's being an ignorant shit . I do ! All the time ! Just not about this . Look , I 'm sorry . It 's just I 've got
zone3	like your self-respect . Hi ! We are here . We decided we 're converting . - Yeah , men suck . - Yeah . Okay , um , take a seat . It looks like it 's going to be a small group . Okay . Ooh ! Okay , then , I guess we 'll get started . I 'm Tru . This is Walter . Welcome to the first meeting of the Walt Whitman High School Gay/Straight Alliance . Man , I 'm surprised you 're not at that meeting . We have practice . Otherwise you 'd be there ? Look , it 's important to Tru . Tru 's important to me . You got a problem with that ? No , man , I do n't . I 'm just saying ... Take a knee . Is that the best we can do , ladies ? Huh ? Christ ! What is it ? You do n't want to be here ? Is that the problem ? I know ! You have somewhere better to be . Why do n't we just finish early
zone3	your little gay meeting , huh ? God ! What is this world coming to ? Kids ca n't even say prayers in class . But the fags , they get their own club ! Never would have happened in my day . Never ! So , what 's it gon na be , ladies ? Are we gon na put a little muscle into these plays , or we just gon na call it quits for the day , you can go meet your boyfriends at the Fag Scouts of America , huh ? We want to play ball , Coach ! Who are we ? Chargers ! What do we do ? Play ball ! Then let 's play ball ! I mean , the problem is people just do n't think of it as a civil-rights issue . Exactly . I think it 's absolutely absurd when people say that gay marriage is any less a civil-rights issue than segregation was for blacks . Right . I mean , separate is n't equal . If only today 's courts had the guts to legalize gay marriage .
zone3	it as long as it 's not our boyfriends . Yeah . Listen , it 's great that everyone has so much to say , but we were actually supposed to be out of here half an hour ago . But we 're gon na meet again at the same time and place next week , so , yeah , bring your friends . That was great . I 'm totally psyched . Me , too . I think it went really well . - Yeah , it did . - Excuse me . Sorry . I just wanted to say how much I admire you both for doing this . I mean , it 's brave , and it 's really kind of wonderful . Thanks . Yeah , thank you . - It was Trevor , right ? - Yeah . Congratulations , kids ! What you 're doing here is terrific . I 'm announcing it to all my classes . Not to promote stereotypes , but they do n't call themselves " drama queens " for nothing . So , what are you guys up to
zone3	Oh , Walter 's not going anywhere . We 've got rehearsal . He 's a Jet , you know . And when you 're a Jet , you 're a Jet all the way . From your first cigarette to your last dying day . Say " Maria . " " Maria ? " No ! Say it loud , like it 's music playing . Maria ! Nope , nope , nope , nope . I guess we 're just gon na have to keep looking for our Tony . Come along , Walter . - Bye . - Bye . So , where are we going ? Well , we are gon na go see the sights . There are sights ? Oh , yeah . Coming up on our left is the best taquer ? a north of Tijuana . - Really ? - Mm-hmm . Well , I admit I have yet to achieve my lifelong ambition of eating at every one , but I 'm pretty close . And this place is still the best . Do you like Mexican food ? Who does
zone3	you like used bookstores ? You mean dusty , narrow little shops full of out-of-print books ? Usually with two guys in the back ... With thick glasses and dandruff . Arguing about whether or not Kerouac is overrated . Oh , my G ... If there 's a heaven , I think that 's what it smells like . Okay . You 're really weird . I like that in a person . Well , in case you are into that sort of thing , the only decent used book store in the whole Valley is actually right back there on your left . I do n't have you in any of my classes . Are you a senior ? Yep . I 'll be going to UCLA in the fall , actually . Wow . Impressive . What will you be studying ? I 'm torn between undecided and undeclared . That 's about it for the main drag , but I do know the perfect spot to watch the sun go down . Wow . You were right . This place is almost beautiful from way up
zone3	they kind of ... Okay , I 'm not that big of a fag hag . What are you talking about ? I 'm not gay . Of course you are ! I think I 'd know . What were you doing at the meeting ? What were you doing at the meeting ? Oh , my God . Do I really seem that gay ? You 're good-looking and well-groomed , and you dress like a hipster . I guess I just made assumptions . And those are all bad qualities in someone asking you out ? They 're not . Of course they 're not . Wait . You 're asking me out ? Do you already have a boyfriend or something ? There 's no easy way to explain this . I guess you could say that I have a friend who 's a guy , but it would n't be a problem for me to start seeing you , just as long as nobody at school found out . I 'm sorry . What ? That sounded really bad , huh ? You know what ?
zone3	who 's gon na sneak around with someone else 's girl . No , no , it 's not like that . Everybody at school thinks I 'm dating this guy . He 's on the football team , but really we 're just good friends . So , that 's the big secret ? That you 're not humping this football player ? Yeah . You see , it 's kind of important to him for people to think that we 're , like , a couple . Oh . Oh . Oh ! I think I 'm starting to get the picture now . You 're his Katie . Yeah . So , in reality , I 'm totally available , but I would n't wan na hurt him . I get it , Tru . It 's all so twisted , huh ? Yeah . Yeah , it 's pretty twisted . I really do n't give a damn who knows or does n't know who I 'm dating . I 'm so sorry ! I should have called . Yes , you should have ! And
zone3	boy ? Why are we paying for your cell phone if you do n't even answer when we call you ? I 'm sorry ! Sorry is not good enough . We were worried sick . - Leslie and I ... - Will you stop , please ? This is the most exciting night of my life , and you 're ruining it . What 's going on ? I met a boy . I thought he was gay , but he is n't . He 's a gay-acting straight boy . Is n't that cool ? We 're going out again this weekend . No , you are not . You are grounded this weekend . No , mom , you ca n't . Please . You were young once . Do n't you remember the excitement you felt the first time you met Lisa ? Boy , she 's good . Please ? Can we do another punishment ? I 'll do the dishes for a week . I 'll take out the trash . Those are already your chores . But I 'll really do them ...
zone3	get to meet this boy . And you have to be home by 10:00 . Thank you , thank you , thank you . - Homework . - Okay . Okay . " You were young once " ? She was talking to you . Dad , I 'm home . Where you been ? Um , I 've actually been on a date . Kind of a date . I mean , I met this really amazing girl today . I 'll make hot chocolate . We 'll talk all about it . Dad , please do n't go all Golden Girls on me . Ca n't you just punch me in the arm and say , " Way to go " ? Way to go , stud . Now , sit your ass down . I 'm making hot chocolate ! Okay . Do you want to do something Saturday night ? You know , like a movie or something ? Ca n't . I already have plans . Plans ? Oh , what , with your moms ? No . With Trevor . Who ? Trevor .
zone3	he really faggy like that guy Walter ? Does the phrase " internalized homophobia " mean anything to you ? I 'm not trying to say there 's anything wrong with that . I 'm just trying to figure out if I know this guy . That 's him . Blond hair , tall and lean , with the other Honors geeks . Yeah , well , he fits in pretty well with the geeks . You sound jealous ! That 's ridiculous . Why would I be jealous of some other gay guy ? Well , you should n't be . You 're still my best pal . But he 's not gay . Slow down , Trevor . I 'm thrilled you 're heterosexual , but you do n't need to prove it on our first date . Second date . Look , I want to take things slow . And if that 's not okay ... It 's okay . It 's totally okay . I 'm sorry . I just got a little over-excited . You 're beautiful . You 're so full of shit .
zone3	beautiful . Even more so if you do n't even really know it . You mean it ? Yeah , of course I mean it . Now , can I please just feel you up ? Come here . You must be thrilled . Trevor could n't be any whiter . Will you stop ? Lodell is a very nice young man , and so is Trevor , do n't you think ? Yeah , but does n't he also seem a bit gay to you ? I mean , what if Tru only attracts gay men ? He 's straight . Do n't worry . What makes you so sure ? They 've been parked in his car making out for the past half hour . What ? Why did n't you tell me ? Because I knew you 'd wan na go out there and stop them . Yeah ! Did n't you ? Yes , but I do n't think that 's best for Tru . She needs to learn how to make her own choices . You know what ? She 's just a kid .
zone3	pressure on a girl . " Boys like that " ? You set me up for that . I 'm just pointing out that I 'm not the only one carrying around childhood baggage . Fine , but if she ends up pregnant , I 'm holding you responsible . So , I thought it 'd be a good idea if we went around the room and introduced ourselves . If you do n't feel comfortable giving your name , that 's fine . Just pass or make one up . So , who wants to go first ? Hi . My name is Roberto , and I 'm an alcoholic . What ? Wrong meeting ? Actually , I 'm just a fag . - What 's that song ? - What ? Nothing . Just something I got stuck in my head . So , how many were there last week ? Where ? The fag group . Tiffany and Rhonda went . Ask them . Coach is right . It 's a sign of the moral decay in America . Man , you are talking completely out
zone3	from tooth decay . I know one thing ... fags are taking over this school . It 's not right . Okay , everybody , we ought to wrap it up . Um , anyone who wants to help out with Queer Awareness Week , Trevor has the sign-up sheet . And if anyone wants PFLAG scholarship info , I 've got it . And I got brochures from L.A . 's Gay and Lesbian Center . I know it 's kind of far , but they have really great youth services . I hope you guys do n't mind , but I thought a little publicity might be just the ticket . I invited Adrienne . She writes for the school paper . This was amazing . Was last week 's meeting this well-attended ? No . It 's definitely grown . Cool . Do you guys mind if I get a picture ? - Yeah . - Yeah . Cheese . You never say that you 're straight . She did n't ask . That was n't the point . Yeah , but everyone 's gon na think
zone3	is for them to think that I 'm gay . Lo , you are gay , in case you 've forgotten . Yeah , and in case you 've forgotten , I 'm not exactly ready to come out yet . - I thought you respected that . - I did . I do . But you need to respect my needs , too . Oh , you have a need for people to think you 're a dyke ? God , we fight like we are in a relationship . Why do I get all the grief and none of the goodies ? Well , I thought you were getting the goodies from Trevor . What 's that supposed to mean ? Are you sleeping with him ? What ? No ! That 's not any of your business ! You know , I think you 're just jealous because only one of us has a real boyfriend . Ah , screw you ! ? It 's not like me ? ? To admit I was wrong ? ? It 's not my style ? ? Sorry ... ?
zone3	- Hey . Ohh ! Trouble in paradise . Watch out . What happened ? You two lovebirds get into a fight ? Nah , nah , we 're cool . Lo , I ca n't do this anymore . I just ... Lo and I are not boyfriend and girlfriend , okay ? We 're just good friends . So , why 'd you lie to us ? It was my idea . Okay . Why ? I wanted to help out Tru . She did n't want people thinking that she was a lesbian . Oh , shit ! Are you serious ? Guys ! Look , seriously , as far as I 'm concerned , it 's totally fine . Mm-hmm . I love Rosie and Ellen . What ? Man , I did n't even like her when I thought she was straight . The feeling 's mutual . I did n't like you even when I thought you were straight . What are you talking about ? Ai n't nobody straighter than me ! Studies show guys who are homophobic are the one's with the
zone3	what back ? - I 'm just telling you scientific data . - No . You 're calling me a faggot . Your actions are saying things about you . - Do n't turn your back on me , dyke ! - Or what ? You 'll hit me ? Yeah , because hitting me is gon na make you a real man , right ? Yeah , let me show you how much of a man I am ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Are you crazy ? You even lay a finger on her , and you 're off the team permanently ! And you know that ! - This ai n't over , bitch ! - Walk ! Whoa ! Hey , Big Stuff . What 's the matter ? You ca n't say hello to your Gran anymore ? I know we raised you better than that . Sorry , Gran . Hello . What 's wrong ? Well , you look like your dog died . We do n't have a dog . Do n't you sass me , boy ! If
zone3	That white girl ? Yeah , the white girl . Oh , I 'm sorry , baby . I know you cared for her . Yeah . What happened ? You cheat on her ? What ? You did not just ask me that ! I love you , baby boy , but you 're a man . And there 's one thing Gran knows is about men . You do n't know about me . I know about men , and you a man , and it makes no difference ' cause that 's the way you do it . So , what 's everybody in the mood for ? Cosmos ? Appletinis ? Ca n't you make anything gayer ? Do n't fuss . Whatever 's easier . Look , sweetie . Look at you , pumpkin ! What are you guys doing here ? It 's only been a couple of months , and you look like you 've grown about a foot . Is everything okay ? Everything 's fine . We wanted to surprise you . Plus , we have some special news to share
zone3	Thank you . Emmett totally surprised me last weekend . It was very romantic . Took me to Canada . I just wish it meant something in this country . Does n't matter . It 's great . I 'm really happy for you two . This is your happy face ? I 'm sorry . It 's been a rough day . More boy trouble ? Your gay boyfriend or the straight one ? The gay one . Invite him over . Maybe we can straighten him out . So to speak . Oh , my gosh . Hey . Um , I did n't expect you to call . I 'm still mad at you , but I want you to come over tonight . My dads came into town unexpectedly . I want you to meet them . Are you still there ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm here . So , can you come over ? Um , the thing is , I 've got a lot of homework , so ... Well , we can work on it together . Or you can just
zone3	... I think it 'd be a really good thing if you could meet some gay men who are happy and well-adjusted . Yeah , tonight 's not really good . Listen , I got ta go . I 'll ... I 'll see you tomorrow . ? You never really cried ? ? Ca n't find a reason ? ? Face down And you 're running out of time ? This feels really ... transgressive , eating lunch together out in the open at school . Transgressive ? When did you swallow a thesaurus ? Sorry , my dad 's a novelist . Well , actually , he 's my uncle , but ... He 's your father and your uncle ? How Chinatown . It 's nothing gross , really . He 's my uncle , but he raised me , so I call him Dad . I do n't really remember my biological father . What about your mom ? She 's around . I see her Sundays , holidays . No sharp objects . That whole thing . Wow . Yeah . And I thought my
zone3	of it . Tell me . I 'd like to know . Yeah ? Okay . Reader 's Digest version . When I was about 4 , I went to live with my Uncle Daniel , and soon after , Papa Chad , which is what I called him , moved in . Wait . Your dad/uncle is gay ? Sorry . I thought I mentioned that . Anyway , he 's a really , really good guy . You should come over and meet him sometime . Okay . Do n't look now , but is n't that your other boyfriend ? Okay . Okay , that 's good . That 's the curb . All right . All right , we 're here . Turn that off and then ... You got ta jiggle ... turn it ... I got it . Well , here we are . Home sweet homo . Dad , I 'm home ! Jesus ! You could have warned me . Sorry . This is Tru . You said , " Bring her over any time . " I meant any time with
zone3	. Tru , sorry . It 's very nice to meet you . Nice to meet you , too . Please forgive the way I look . I work from home , so I do n't usually have to get dressed until late in the day . Or the next day . You look really familiar , sir . Are you famous or something ? Call me Daniel . I 'm far too young and pretty to be a " sir . " Oh , God ! And I 'm semi-well-known by a very small , very insular group of gay literati . Wait a minute . You 're Daniel Goldstein . You 're , like , my dad 's favorite author . Are you kidding ? You 've heard of him ? Yeah . I read Confessions of a Short , Fat , Jewish Kid . I loved it . Trevor , you must marry this girl immediately . She 's obviously a young woman of taste and distinction . Oh , boy . Are you working on a new book ? Tru , I think we should go
zone3	with you later . Okay . All done with your homework ? No . I ... I ca n't seem to concentrate . It 's ' cause I 'm so sexy , is n't it ? You are sexy , but ... Look , why do n't you just call Lo , huh ? You mean now ? Why not ? You 're not getting much work done . And quite frankly , you 're not such great company . I 'm sorry . I know this is unfair to you . I 'll survive . Just work it out , okay ? It 'll be all right . I promise . What up ? You know what to do . Hi . You must be Lo 's Mom . I 'm ... Gertrude . How do you do ? So happy to finally meet you . I keep asking Lo to bring you around , but you know how he is . Yeah , I do . It 's nice to meet you , too . Um , is Lo home ? I really need to talk to him
zone3	here . Mama said he was here this afternoon and went out . Did n't say where he was going . Okay . Thanks . He did n't get you in trouble , did he ? What ? No ! God , no ! I 'm sorry . It 's just that ... We used to talk , and , um , now I 'm just trying to keep up with what 's going on in his life but he shuts me out . He was such a good boy . He 's still a good boy . I know , but something 's on his mind . If you see him , can you have him call me ? ? I wan na tell you something About life and love ? ? I wan na tell you secrets And show you what I 'm made of ? ? I 'm down I 'm down ? What up ? You know what to do . ? I wan na make this with you With all my heart ? ? I wan na let you know That I 'm with you

Tru , wait ! Oww ! Oh , my foot ! Lo , are you okay ? Ooh , that hurts ! God , I 'm ... I 'm sorry . Tell Walter I 'm sorry , too . I did n't mean to interrupt you guys . I know . But , Christ , what do you two think you were doing ? I mean , I know what you were doing . But just this afternoon you were parading around school with your arm around Tiffany . The two do n't have anything to do with each other . Does she know you 're screwing boys ? She gets to be the girlfriend of the star quarterback . I get what I want . It 's win-win . Except she does n't know anything about
zone3	with you already . And what about Walter ? Is this fair to him ? That 's between me and him . You called him faggy . - You made fun of him . - Shh . So , he 's good enough to fuck , but not good enough to hang out with ? Look , you do n't understand . Where I 'm from , this is just kinda how things work . You have your regular life , and you have your other life . - You have to keep the two separate . - And that 's what you want ? This ai n't San Francisco . And I ai n't some privileged white boy who can fly a rainbow flag and march in some parade . I got plans . Okay , so , all of a sudden you 're a homeboy ? All about , about keepin ' it real , livin ' in the ' hood ? We all live in the same world , Lo . Yeah , that 's real easy for you to say . You 've got your two
zone3	you no matter what , right ? I met your mom . She loves you . God , does she love you ! Wait , you met my mom ? What did you say to her ? God , is that all you can think about ? That I 'm going to blow your cover ? You know , it 'd probably be the best thing I could do for you . You would n't do that . Why not ? Because you 're my friend . Yeah . Not much of a friend you 've been to me lately . Tru , come on . Please do n't be mad at me . I 'm not mad . I 'm just disappointed . And do n't worry . I 'm not gon na tell on you . Is what she said true ? Wait , Walter . - You think I 'm a silly faggot ? - No . Good for getting your rocks off . That 's all . No ! It 's not like that . I think you 're a great guy . You 're smart
zone3	your own skin . I just ... But you do n't want to be seen in public with me . That 's about me , not you . Yeah , well sneaking around just kind of feels icky . I think I should go . See ya . Okay , I 'm sorry . You wan na make sure it stays . Here . Whoa ! At least in my day , the queers had the good sense to be ashamed . Practice is over ! I feel sick to my stomach . Man , we got ta do something about this . What are you talking about ? Let ' em know this ai n't right . Man , there 's nothing we can do . Just forget about it . I get carsick with my eyes closed . Come on . It 's just for a minute , all right ? Walter and I did something . I think you 're gon na love it , and I want you to get the full effect . I 'm excited . Close your eyes , close your eyes !
zone3	. This was n't part of the plan . Walter ! Are you okay ? That was the football team . Could n't see any of their faces , though . Could you guys ? One of the cars was Manuel 's . Okay , we 've got them ! If we report it , they 'll cancel the game on Friday , maybe suspend the whole team . Then the whole school 's gon na hate us . So , what are we supposed to do ? Pretend it did n't happen ? Look , we 're screwed if we report this . They 'd probably cancel all the plans that we 've made , okay ? Figure it 's too risky . This is ridiculous ! So , there 's nothing that we can do ? Today is my birthday . So , who else have we got ? Oh , Tru ! Tru , honey , come into the dining room . I 'm busy ! Gertrude , your dads are here . Come say hi . Hi . Now , can I please go to my
zone3	spice . - What 's wrong , honey ? - What 's wrong , sweetheart ? Please , can we just drop it ? I have homework to do . Oh , good idea , because then you 'll be free for next Sunday . Why ? What 's next Sunday ? Just our wedding . You 're maid of honor . What ? You 're ... You 're kidding ! Technically , it 's just a commitment ceremony . The boys here inspired us . Yeah , I thought it was about time I make an honest woman out of her . Congratulations ! Thank you ! We 've got a lot of planning to do , so we 're gon na need your help . Of course . Anything , anything ! Can you come in for a minute ? Sure , bro . Manny , if we were ever friends , you have got to promise me that you 're not gon na try to talk me into some bullshit stunt like that again . Man , what are you talking about , " If we were
zone3	man . You 're my best friend . Then just leave Tru and her group alone , man . You do n't have to like them . Just leave ' em be . Bet you it 's her . - It 's Tru . - Yeah . - Hey . - Hey . I swear , I did n't know anybody was gon na be there . Is ... Is Walter okay ? He 's furious , but he 's okay . Thank God . We 're all furious , Lo . I did n't think I 'd ever speak to you again . But at least you 've made it right . Wait , what do you mean ? The blast e-mail you sent out . That was so brave . What are you talking about ? I have n't even logged on today . No fucking way . I did n't send this ! Somebody hacked into my account ! Oh , my God ! I ... Hey , I got ta go . Lo , do n't tell me this is why we have n't been hanging
zone3	did n't send this . Seriously , dude ? Seriously ! Look , somebody 's trying to get back at me for what happened tonight . - You must be pissed ! - Of course I 'm pissed ! But I ca n't blame them . What we did was fucked up . Come on , man . We were messin ' around . It was wrong , Manny . They 're just trying to teach a little tolerance . What were we trying to do ? Listen , you 'd better go . I 've got to send out a real e-mail right now . Yeah . So , you 're not ... I 'll see you tomorrow , Manny . Hey , hun . Did you hack Lo 's e-mail ? Well , I could n't have done it without Walter . But was n't that fantastic ? Revenge is so sweet . Jerk ! You 're stooping to their level . Oh , wait , you 're mad at me ? We could have reported this to someone ... Principal Velasquez , the ACLU , somebody .
zone3	down our banner ? Of course I 'm mad at him , but I know he 's got issues . What , and I 'm not allowed to have feelings ? Babe , Walter and I worked on that thing for two weeks . We wanted to surprise you . This was n't your secret to tell . You know what ? It is always the people in the closet who are doing the most damage . If it 's not some evangelical preacher screwing a rent boy on the side , it 's some Catholic priest fondling his parishioners . I 'm so sick of it . Yeah , so am I , but if you would 've just given me a chance to talk to him , maybe he could have found the courage to do this himself . Okay , yeah . I would n't put my money on that one . I just ... Can I sit here ? Look , I 'm sorry if I hurt you . We should have checked with you first , but I 'm not sorry that we did it
zone3	maid of honor . You 're my date , by the way , so dress sharp . I 'm supposed to help them find someone to officiate , but I do n't have a clue where to start . This book is no help . You should just ask my dad . He has one of those Universal Church of Life certificates . He used to do that stuff all the time before he and Chad broke up . You think he 'd do it ? He might . For some crazy reason , he really likes you . What on Earth are you doing ? You ca n't marry Trevor . What are you talking about ? Did he get you pregnant ? Why does everyone keep asking me that ? Well , then why else would you be marrying him ? I 'm not marrying anyone . But the book . My moms are getting married on Sunday . Your moms ? Yeah . I was gon na call you . We want you to sing at the wedding . I mean , if you 're not worried
zone3	not really marrying Trevor ? Get a grip , Lo . Hey , you wan na come in ? I got ta go . Hey , kid . Trevor 's not here . Out picking up hookers , I think . Kidding . We always order in . What 's up ? I have a really big favor to ask . Huge , actually . My moms are getting married this Sunday , and we were hoping that you would conduct the ceremony . Trevor 's told me you 've done it , like , a million times . The little breeder sold me out ! Would you do it ? Please ? I know you do n't know them , but that 's kind of the point . We 're new here , so we 're inviting lots of people we do n't know so we can all get to know each other better . Plus , you know me , right ? It 'll be fun . I hate weddings ... ever since Chad and I broke up . Happy couples make me nauseous . Well , if
zone3	time . There 'll be liquor , right ? Tons . Okay . I 'm in . Although today 's ceremony does not yet have the power of law in this state , I believe that in the eyes of God ... or perhaps the Goddess ... these two women are already married . They have been since they committed to love and cherish each other , since the day they decided to raise a child together . They 've been through sickness and health . They 've been through thick and thin . They 've been through puberty . They 've been through all of it . And it 's only made their love grow stronger . Now , if that does not define what a marriage is , I do not know what does define it . So , by the power vested in me by the Internet ... And this is legal . You could have gone to Vegas and gotten an Elvis impersonator who would have charged you a lot more money . I know pronounce you ... committed . - Whoo ! - Whoo !
zone3	it ! Come on ! Come on ! You are never going to believe this . Lo broke up with Tiffany , and there was n't even a fight or anything . Excuse me , ladies . We are working . That clinches it . Lo 's definitely gay . What the hell are you two talking about ? It 's nothing , Coach . Where do you think he is today ? A gay wedding ! Get dressed . Go on . Talk to him . What ? No , no . I 'm dancing with you . Technically . I 'm sorry . I just did n't think he 'd come . You invited him , Tru . Go on . Ask him to dance . You do n't mind ? Sure , I mind , but it 's better than dancing with you while you 're mooning at him . - I 'm not mooning . - Uh-huh . Just talk to him , okay ? And maybe we can enjoy the rest of the reception . Go . I did n't think you 'd come .
zone3	Emmett brought to our wedding ! You 're David Kopay ! Lo . The first pro athlete to come out . Back when we were kids . He was a pioneer . And I 'm so glad things have changed , and there are young gay athletes out there who do n't feel a need to hide . Lo is n't actually out . He 's here as a tourist . Let 's get you something to drink . What ? So , wan na dance ? Okay . So , now you 've been to your first gay wedding . How does it feel ? Weird . I do n't ... Everybody just seems so normal . It 's weird because everyone seems so normal ? You know what I mean . I mean ... Okay , I was brought up to think that gay people are weird and strange , but this wedding was just like any other , except for no groom . Just swallow your pride . I , uh , broke it off with Tiffany . You were right . She was totally falling for
zone3	really proud of you . That must have been hard . That living-on-the-down-low thing sounded good for a while . I mean , my life is nobody else 's business , right ? But I do n't know how you do that without hurting people . Like Walter and you . I 'm fine . I just want you to live a life you deserve . I do n't want you sneaking around , having sex in tree houses . Hey , that tree house is romantic ! Hi . Mind if I cut in ? Oh . Yeah , sure . Not her , silly . You . Me ? Hello ! We 're at a gay wedding . If we ca n't dance here , where can we dance ? Okay . Um , I thought you were mad at me . Mad does n't even begin to cover it . If you would n't have danced with me , I would have decked you . Well , you 're a pretty good dancer , so it looks like I made a good choice . Well , it
zone3	I ? Son of a bitch . Get up , bastard ! Lo , no ! You have nothing to prove ! Lo ! So , it 's true , is n't it ? Tiffany tried telling me you were queer , and I would n't believe it . We grew up together , man ! You spent the night at my house ! Man , it 's not even what it looks like . We were just goofing around . All right , then you tell me . Are you a queer or not ? Are you serious ? Whatever . Rhonda says I ca n't call you " queer . " Only queers get to use the word " queer . " Then , I guess I can say it . What the hell is this crap ? You mean to tell me that I 've got a queer for a quarterback ? Yeah , Coach , you do . Yeah , well , think again . You 're off the team ! I do n't think so , Coach . You see , that violates district policy
zone3	that statement , or you can reconsider your employment . You go , girl ! Uh , I mean , very well put , sir . You coming , Manny ? He 's my best friend , Coach . Yeah . It figures . I 'm surrounded by a bunch of pansies ! Thanks . Why did n't you tell me , man ? You could have trusted me . All you got ta do is talk to me . Talk to you ? Manny , all you ever do is go on about how much you hate fags . Yeah , but I do n't hate you . You 're my boy , man . If this situation was the other way around , I would 've definitely trusted you and come and told you . I ... I 'm sorry . I did n't think you could handle it . Why ? ' Cause you think I 'm an asshole ? Um , you are kind of an asshole . Nobody asked you , guys . You just smack me upside the head like you usually do and
zone3	! I did n't mean , like , right now , dick . I love you , man . Nothing gon na change that . Okay , everyone , I think the show is over . Young man , I believe we were promised a song . I do n't know . I only ever sung in church . Go ! You nearly busted up this wedding . I think you owe us a song . If it were n't such a clich� ? , I 'd suggest I Will Survive . Yeah , I do n't know that one , but ... Okay , I do have this thing that I kind of wrote . Could I show the band ? Hey , you know what really hurts ? What ? I spent hours in the gym sculpting this amazing body , and I never saw Lo check me out once . You are so vain . You really should have been gay . It 's a big loss to your community . Believe me , we 're devastated . Mm-hmm . Sorry . ? Who 's gon na
zone3	forgiving ? ? ? Please , someone , tell me How to stop wastin ' my time ? ? And , baby , will you show me ? ? How to get through This life I 'm living ? ? I want the wisdom To know what is mine ? ? I get a little lonely ... ? I think we finally found our Tony . ? But every time you find me You never let me down ? So , we gon na dance ? You and me ? No . I meant everybody . Everyone in general , dance . Well , my beau is providing the entertainment . So , may I ? Yes . ? ' Cause when it comes to love ? ? We 've got to be true ? - Would you care to dance ? - Oh , I 'm okay . I 'm known to cut a pretty mean rug . Well , maybe one dance . ? When we 're apart You can depend on mine ? ? I guess you 're gon na hold me ... ? I do n't
zone3	make some sort of announcement . I have no idea what you 're talking about . Oh , Bushie . You 're my best friend , so I 'm going to try to put this as delicately as I can .

Did you try this on before you bought it , because the fit is very peculiar . ? Just to be with you ? ? I know , I know , I know That we 've got to be ready ? ?

Our Emily Boyd is on the ground in Caracas . Emily , what are you hearing now ? Jim , as you can imagine , the situation on the ground in Caracas can be described as a state of chaos

Is this what we got in trouble for in Abu Ghraib ? I do n't know why anybody actually signed up to be a room mother . Yeah . Hey , Timmy ! - What are you doing ? - Sorry , Mom .

From Georgetown ? - Yeah . - Okay , get on him , too , all right ? - Get the door for me , would you , Kelly ? - No problem . Thanks . Okay , Rache . We 're gon na fast track the story . Your story . Really ? When ? The New York Times has gotten hold of some of the information , so we 're going to beat them to the punch . Yeah . Want to get it on the doorsteps tomorrow . I mean , it 's a killer story . No , I know . It 's Watergate . It 's Iran-Contra . It mean , it 's a " holy shit " piece , Bonnie . - It 's gon na take them down . - Rachel . - Sorry . Got ta rein it in . I 'm kind of excited . - Okay , we got ta remain objective
zone3	the White House . What else do you need to do to finish the story ? I got ta call the White House . Of course , go to Van Doren herself . Out of curiosity , why have n't you spoken to her yet ? Avril , I already told you , if we went to her too early , we give the CIA time to shut the story down . We go now , there 's nothing they can do . Okay . Look , legally the story is solid . Everything is factually in line . There 's no libel . Well , that 's all that 's important , right ? I wish you would let me know who your source is on this . A title , a job description . Okay , look , we have two confirming sources . Rachel told me who they are , and I 'm comfortable with them . We have Van Doren 's letter to the CIA director that the Feds gave to Rachel . - That 's enough to go to press . - It 's your
zone3	what you guys are okay with , the government may not be . The laws are murky . I 'm sorry , what ? It 's illegal for a government official to reveal the identity of an undercover CIA agent . Okay . Well , I 'm not a government official . I do n't understand why you 're bringing ... You know what ? We 've already discussed this . Bonnie 's signed off on it . As long as we all know what we 're dealing with . All right , we know . Okay , do you know how to find her ? Van Doren ? Yeah . I 'll go to her as soon as I get out of here . Our kids go to school together , if you can believe that . - No shit ? - Yeah . Okay , you feel comfortable going to her for comment ? Absolutely . Yeah ! That 's it ! Come on ! Pass it in ! - Stay open , Ali ! - Angela , pass it to me . I got it ! I

Cody 's class . Right ? - Yeah . - Yeah , my son , too . - I see . - Come on , Allison . - There you go , there you go , honey ! Could we talk in private ? I 'm with the Sun Times , I need a few minutes . It 's kind of important . Yeah . Sure . I 'm just concerned she might have seen me slip away . - I wo n't keep you long . - Okay .
zone3	writing a story . I work for the national desk . - Okay ? - Neat . And it 's gon na run tomorrow , and it 's gon na say , among other things , that you are a CIA operative , and that you went on a mission , a fact-finding mission to Venezuela . What ? This is ... Hear me out , okay ? You went there on a fact-finding mission to determine if its government was responsible for the assassination attempt on President Lyman . You determined it was not , and you informed your bosses of this . This is the stupidest B.S . I have ever heard . Wait , wait . What ? Can you ... How do I know that you 're from the Sun Times ? The White House ignored your findings and launched an attack anyway , still claiming retribution for the assassination attempt . I 've been on the national desk for five years . I have a column every Tuesday on the editorial page . My son goes to school here , too . Yeah , I
zone3	people ! My God ! You fucking people ! You know , this is n't about me . Once again , it 's about my husband . My source is impeccable . Your source is 110% fucking peccable . I 'm a CIA operative ? I ca n't even use the navigation system in my Prius . This is ... This is absurd ! Your paper ... Your paper has been trying to fuck my husband ever since he spoke out against this administration . - We have your memo . - What memo ? - We have your findings . - You know . My attorney is Harry Timmers . - Do you know him ? - Sure . He 's gon na take a lead pipe to you , and he 's gon na shove it up your ass . Well , I certainly do n't want that . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? Our kids go to school together , Robin . - Rachel Armstrong . - Right . Whatever . Are you denying you 're CIA ? You know what ?
zone3	it . Just say that the White House does n't comment on security issues . Is that what you 're saying ? Come on , David . Give me something I can spell . Off the record , this is bullshit . You 're gon na set off a shit storm for nothing , for a lousy column inch of space . - Rachel , it 's your son on line five . - You 're gon na have egg on your face . I got ta go , David . I got my son on the other line . Hey , kiddo . Hi , Mom . Did you get my paper ? Yeah , I 'm just getting it now . Can I read it and call you back ? Okay , but I got ta go to bed soon . Okay . Well , you can wait up for me to call you . But Dad said I had to go to bed . Well , we 'll do it in the morning . I promise . Okay . It 's just , I have a real
zone3	. Okay , I love you . Bye-bye . - Sorry . - Hey , what 's that ? My son had to do a paper on India . I was just looking over his outline . I bet you he could give me 10 inches on India 's nuclear buildup with Pakistan . - Oh , yeah . - How 'd you do with David ? " White House does n't comment on security issues . " Blah-blah . Yeah , well , I know you 'll give it more eloquent phrasing than " blah-blah . " - Sure . - Feels good , huh ? It 's worth every dime I do n't make . Look , I want you to start on a major profile of Van Doren , from Yale to CIA , to the marriage to the ambassador 20 years older than her . He was her professor . He was married . A whole drama , I hear . Now , that 's some good stuff . Look , by the way , you deserve a good night 's sleep . If I were
zone3	off . Hey , Erica . - Why are we meeting here , Merrill ? - For the chili . No . Why are we meeting out in the open like this ? We 're not out in the open , Erica . No one knows who you are . Now tomorrow , when that goddamn story comes out , tomorrow you 'll be out in the open . Shit ! Your husband had to go and write those articles , did n't he ? Keep him out of this . You 're right , Erica . It 's not Oscar 's fault . Oscar has n't been trained in covert ops . Oscar did n't take an oath of secrecy . No , it 's your fault . You should n't have told him anything . Okay , hey , guys . Here 's the SITREP . The paper will be out in two hours . They have n't put it up on the Net . They did n't want to give the West Coast papers a chance to put it in their morning editions . And Justice is
zone3	find out who exposed you . I ca n't believe this . I mean , our kids go to school together , you know , the reporter 's kid and mine . Wait a second . You know her ? Well , I kind of recognized her today , but we 'd never spoken before that moment . Let me ask you straight out , Erica . Was it you ? - Was it me , what ? - Was it you who leaked to the Sun Times ? I mean , it 's understandable . The White House ignored your report , and you got pissed . You goaded Oscar to write those quote-unquote , opinion pieces . When that did n't get traction , you went to the press yourself . I went to the press myself . Someone you knew . Someone you trusted . Fuck you . Fuck me ? Touch ? . The prosecutor , Patton Dubois , he 'll be in tomorrow . He 'll get Armstrong before the grand jury . Law says Armstrong has to give up her source . Could it
zone3	you , O'Hara ? How we all doing ? Still doing good ? - Doing good . - You sure ? - Good . - All right . I 'm gon na put you on the box . Oscar , too . Fine . But I want everybody in the agency who knows my identity , I want them with polygraph wires up their asses , too , because there 's a traitor among us . We 'll find that person if they 're in the CIA . Nonetheless , we should think about relocating you for your own good . No . No . I will send Allison away for a little while , but none of this shit was my fault . I 'm not gon na be punished . This Lois Lane and her newspaper , I 'm not gon na let her turn me into a scared little girl . I 'm staying here . Whatever . In the meantime , we 'll assign a protective detail to your home . I feel so much safer . Thank you . I ca n't fucking believe this
zone3	today ? - Yeah . This is very interesting . It 's awesome . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Wow . I did n't realize they made so much coffee in India . It also has the most democrats in the world . Well , not quite . India is the biggest democracy in the world . - Is n't that the same thing ? - No , it 's not the same thing . Jesus Christ . Do n't give your carrots to Brandon today . Okay ? Okay , Mom . You did it . This changes everything . You 're gon na win a Pulitzer . I do n't know about that . - Timmy , come on . Eat your breakfast . - I do n't like them . Come on , do n't give Mommy a hard time . Finish your eggs . - Eggs give you cancer . - Eggs do n't give you cancer . All right , you know what ? I 'll finish your cancer , okay . Okay ? Feels pretty good though . That was
zone3	half the stuff that 's in here . Well , you do n't tell me anything that goes into your novels , so it 's fair . A spokesman for the newspaper says because her husband is a vocal opponent of the administration , this makes Mrs . Van Doren 's employment with the CIA absolutely newsworthy . - Mom ? - In Mexico City ... - What 's up , kiddo ? - Can we go to the zoo today ? To the zoo ? It 's a school day . Maybe we can go tonight ? Well , the animals are sleeping at night . You do n't want to mess with sleeping animals . They might be a bit cranky . Okay , come on , sweetie , you 're gon na be late . - You got your stuff ? - You want to finish it ? Great , thank you . Hey . Come on , you 're forgetting . Give me a kiss . I love you . Have a good day . Hey , Connor . I 'm sorry , you scared the
zone3	. I 'm with the FBI . We need you to come with us , please . What for ? I do n't know , ma'am . They just asked me to come here and pick you up . Hey there , Miss Armstrong . Come on in . I 'm Patton Dubois , federal prosecutor . Please come on in . Thanks for coming by . Did I have a choice ? Of course you did . I do n't have anything to say , so if you have a problem , contact my editors . Can I get you a cup of coffee ? No , thank you . Sure , sir , I 'm gon na take some . Great scoop , by the way . If this does n't make your career , God knows what will . Holy moly . That was something . Well , I 'm gon na be announced in a few days , just as soon as all the paperwork goes through , as the special counsel to investigate this leak about Erica Van Doren . - That was fast .
zone3	unusual , but the boys over at Justice seem to think this is a pretty urgent matter , a not-a-second-to-lose kind of thing . So they called me in last night , and I just checked into the hotel this morning , and here we are . The Attorney General 's office has to disqualify itself . Maybe somebody over there was your source , eh ? - I think I should call my lawyer . - That 's not necessary . I 'm not gon na be asking you any questions . Not here , anyway . This is neither the time nor the place . I just wanted to get kind of an unofficial head start . Can I talk to you off the record ? Sure . I mean , a just-between-you-and-me kind of thing . Off the record is off the record . Okay , good . I 'll do all the yada-yada . Now , you were within your rights to print the information that you obtained . However , you 're not within your rights to protect who it was that gave Erica up
zone3	1982 law called the Intelligence Identities Protection Act . Your source is in a great deal of trouble . - I 've no intention of discussing my source ... - Hold on . I 'm doing the yada-yada , remember ? Okay . Okay , look , you 're gon na be asked to appear before a grand jury . You 're gon na be asked to identify your source . I 'll be doing the asking . Now , if , for some reason , you do n't reveal your source , you 'll be held in contempt , and that means jail time , and we 're not talking about some sort of a Martha Stewart cell with a butler , nonsense . Look . Rachel , go to your source . Ask him to permit you to reveal his name . You may be surprised at his willingness to protect you . People are inherently decent , I have found . Well , if that were true , that would put you out of a job , no ? Well , that 's all I 've got
zone3	date . I 'm afraid I 'm gon na disappoint you , Mr . Dubois . That 's not possible . - You ready ? Here she is . - Here she is . Ready to roll ? Rolling . Hey , Erica , why do you think your report was ignored ? Is Erica your real name ? How long have you been with the agency ? All right , I know you 're trying to do your jobs , okay . I 'd love to speak to you . Now is not a good time . I have an appointment here to read to the kids . Is Erica your real name ? Did you give your husband top-secret information ? Does your family know that you 're here ? You know , I 'm a mom . If this CIA report exists , as the Sun Times claims it does , that would seem to indicate the President launched a full-fledged act of war in Venezuela - without justification ... - Thanks . - Really nice work . ... and just based on his own gut instinct
zone3	to the nation and the Congress ... Hey , Rache , they 're waiting for you in Bonnie 's office . ... what is arguably the worst foreign policy decision in this nation 's history . So far , the White House is standing by its actions , but they 're not denying the report . - Rachel . - Yeah , I 'm going . - Kick-ass story , by the way . - Thank you . ... there 's a reason to question the findings . " ' Wait for me . Wait for me . I 'm a fast runner , ' said Ruthie . " ' And I 'd sure like to catch something great , ' " she added , with a fishing pole in hand . " So off they went . Up a hill , down a path , through a grove of trees , " and just as Granny Annie was about to tell Ruthie what she was going to catch ... " If I 'd been a little bit more forceful with you and Larry , saying do n't rush this
zone3	situation . I told you , the government 's gon na take this very seriously . I told ... The next time the FBI hauls you into a fucking interrogation , - your first goddamn phone call is to me ! - I got it . I 'm sorry . Before you even take off your fucking seat belt , you call me ! All right , Avril . You okay ? Yeah , I was dropping Timmy off at school , and the FBI were there , and they asked me to go with them and ... Pretty unnerving , huh ? Being questioned like that . - It was really fast . - They want your source , right ? Yeah . I did n't give it to them . I wo n't give it to them . No way . Okay , please . First of all , this is appalling behavior on the part of the FBI . Snatching you in front of your kid . Strong-arming you . I want to know the name of the agent that interviewed you . Well , it was
zone3	Dubois . He 's being appointed special prosecutor . What ? You know him ? No . No . But a special prosecutor , that 's no good . See , his only requirement is to find your source , with nothing else to divert him . He 's gon na have unlimited time , unlimited moolah , and the chance of unlimited publicity . There 's a lot more investigative power for a special prosecutor than there is for a Fed . Yeah , well , not enough power to make me reveal my source . I have a right to protect my source . - What ? - The federal government does n't have a shield law . Not on issues of national security . 49 states do have some form of protection for journalists , - but not the federal government . - The administration will back off when they see how far we will go to protect Rachel . The federal government is fighting for a principle , too . You see , somebody revealed top secret information to you . That is an act of
zone3	're gon na take this very , very seriously . Yeah , well , so am I , gon na take it very seriously . - Officer , what 's the hold-up ? - Sorry , ma'am . Are you kidding ? My house is right there . - She 's on the list . - All right , go ahead . I want a half-hour of reading every day . - You hear me ? - Am I going to get into trouble - for not going to school ? - No . - I 'll miss my friends . - I know you will , but it 's just gon na be for a little while . You 're gon na have a private tutor . He 's really great . You 'll love him . I promise . Kisses . Butterfly kiss , Eskimo kiss . I love you . I told you this would happen . - You just do n't get it , do you ? - This is your fault . What do you want to listen to , baby ? Who 's your
zone3	! Are we off the record ? Sure . I 'll meet you in the back . You did n't come here to kick my ass , did you ? ' Cause it 's not fair . I 'm not trained in that whole , " Knock somebody 's nose into their brain with the palm of my hand , " thing . No , I use poison darts . Funny . I like your mums . The yellow one's are very cheerful . Thank you . Is your husband still writing ? Yeah , all the time . Every day . I read his novel about the Mossad . I read it while I was on vacation . It was ... It was very entertaining . Thank you . He 's just trying to get out the second one . So ... I 'm sorry I lost my cool with you . Usually it takes a man to bring out the heinous bitch in me . Oscar and I ... It 's probably it , you know , the dagger and all . He 's gone . He left
zone3	go stay with Allison ' cause we had to send her away , too . Allison 's a great kid . She seems very grounded . How do you know her ? You been digging in her past , too ? No . No , I 'm a room mother . Room mother ? Man . You should get hazard pay for that . I come in once every two weeks to read to the kids . It 's a big production . - Mom ? - I love it . I 'm outside , Timmy ! What can I do for you ? I know you ca n't tell me who your source is . I respect that . Okay ? I know about keeping secrets . Just tell me yes or no . All right ? Is ... Is it someone close to me ? Is it ? Is it someone I work with ? I ca n't tell you anything . You know what ? When you go before the grand jury , you will have to speak . - You are an unpatriotic little cunt ...
zone3	off the plank into the bowels of hell . - Do you know that ? - I hear that every day . If you want to go on record , we 'll give you amazing placement . Thank you . - What ? - Hi , Mrs . Van Doren . Hello , handsome . How are you ? How 's Allison doing ? She has n't been in school . Is she sick ? No , no , no . She is great . She 's ... She 's just spending time with a relative . - Can you tell her I said hi ? - You bet . Yes , I will . Is it the door ? Yeah ? - Rachel Armstrong ? - What do you need ? I 'm here to serve you , ma'am . I just barely had time to type that up and get over here . - Is it okay ? Does it make sense to you ? - Yeah . I thought the law was supposed to move slowly ? Except for when it does n't . Hey , this
zone3	middle of the night , dragging you into the Mayflower , it 's all just meant to intimidate you . It 's working . - Well , do n't let it intimidate you . Okay ? - Okay . You 're gon na be fine . Miss Armstrong . Okay , I 'll be down in the lobby . - Okay . - Do n't worry . Rachel Alice Armstrong . 15 Trinity Pass , Washington , D.C . Thanks . Okay , Miss Armstrong . You work as a reporter for the Capital Sun Times , is that correct ? Yes . As the national political correspondent , is that right ? - I am , yes . One of them . - Okay , good . Okay , great . I 'm batting a thousand . You wrote an article a few days ago , here , in which you revealed Erica Van Doren , married to the former US ambassador , Oscar Van Doren , that she was a covert CIA operative . I did , yes . And you feel confident with this story 's veracity
zone3	? - Miss Armstrong ... - One second . I 'm sorry . " I respectfully refuse to answer that question " on the grounds that it would violate my rights " under the First Amendment and federal common law . " You 're aware that anybody with official knowledge of the identity of a CIA operative is forbidden by law to release that information ? I am , yes . So , who was your source ? I ca n't reveal my source ... Okay , look , Miss Armstrong . This is a very serious matter . I want you to take your time . We 're gon na take a recess and come back at , say , 1:30 . I want you to go home . I want you to talk to your family . I want you to talk to your editor . Okay ? And then I want you to talk to your source . Mull it over and see if you all think this is worth a contempt citation , and then we 're gon na reconvene , and then I 'm going
zone3	breath . Well , I 'm not the one that 'll need to hold my breath . Okay , everybody , we 're gon na break it up . We 'll come back at 1:30 . - How long have you been in the CIA ? - Ms . Van Doren ... " ' Can I come too ? ' asked Charlie . " ' I promise to help you catch whatever it is , ' he said . " ' Come on , ' said Ruthie Joe and Granny Annie . " So off they went across the bridge ... " My watch says I 'm early . We just feel like this is not the best time for you to be with the kids . It 's just that , you know , we 're really not equipped to deal with a lot of craziness . Okay . I think it 's idiotic , is what it is . I understand , the press can be a nightmare . Maybe if you were to stay away for a while , then they would go away . I hope
zone3	look forward to reading to the kids . I mean , I 'm pretty good at it , too . I do all the little voices . You are . So ... When were you planning on bringing Ali back to school ? I do n't know . I 'm not sure . I see . Okay . Are you saying that she ca n't come back , Jerry ? - How was your lunch ? - Terrific . Thank you . - Yeah , what 'd you have ? - I actually did n't have anything . Really ? I wish I had your will power . Your source , Miss Armstrong , who is it ? Hey . Well ? How did it go ? - Okay , I guess . - Excuse me . Rachel Armstrong ? - Yes . - I 'm Deputy U.S . Marshal Jones . I have a summons for you to appear in US District Court in two hours . - No , no , no . - What happened to two weeks ? Hey ! I 'm Avril Aaronson , -
zone3	yeah , I read your amicus brief on the Celeste matter last year . I think you could take credit for her release . I really do . I understand all the theatrics up until now , but this ? This is too fast . This is outrageous , and we 're getting into some pretty serious Fifth Amendment issues here . Look , Avril , there 's a traitor out there revealing the names of CIA operatives . Now , I think we should get somebody like that out tout de suite . Do n't you ? We 're bringing in Albert Burnside . I 'll have to go home and get my autograph book , then . Do n't worry about it . It 's not a problem . It 's already in the Sun Times budget . Hi , Avril . Hey , there he is . Albert , thanks for coming . This is Rachel Armstrong . - Glad to meet you . - Hi , me , too . Hey , I 'm Ray , Rachel 's husband . Why is this happening so fast
zone3	before a judge . Well , Mr . Dubois wants to get this done before the press catches up . It 's okay . The press can just complicate things . Let 's concentrate on keeping you out of jail . Jail ? What do you ... When ? You 're gon na ask for a continuance ? Yeah . Sure . Sure . Look , I 've been through this . Judge Hall is a good egg . We exchange Christmas cards . He 's certainly not gon na jail you today . - Jesus Christ . - Ray , relax . I mean , if Albert 's this calm , then we can be , too . Right ? We 'll be out of here in five minutes . Then we 'll get a cup of joe and we 'll strategize how we can protect you and the constitution and democracy itself for generations to come . That 's a Theory , right ? - Yeah . - It 's classy . Thanks . Nice suit . It 's not a suit . It 's a Zegna .
zone3	that you 're wearing ? I do n't know . I 'm putting you in touch with my tailor . You always know when you 're in a Zegna . Court room three . Your Honor , this morning , Miss Armstrong appeared before the grand jury . I furnished you with the transcripts . And as you know , she was asked to reveal the name of the source who provided her , quite possibly illegally , with secret information revealing the ... Excuse me , Your Honor . If I may ? Yes . - All right ? - It 's perfectly okay with me . Your Honor , I just met my client . I ask you to continue this matter for , say , a week , so we can get our bearings here . Let me get my bearings first . Why do n't we proceed for now ? Well , here 's how it is , Your Honor . Mr . Dubois will say that my client was asked to name her source and that she wo n't do so , and , thus
zone3	the information that my client received is highly classified and the GJ is entitled to know the name of the source and to find it out . He 'll also say that there 's no federal shield law protecting her and that there 's no First Amendment protection , either , because this is a matter of , quote-unquote , national security . Is that about right , Mr . Dubois ? In fact , that 's it in a nutshell . We contend that the First Amendment does protect Rachel Armstrong . I 'm well aware of cases in this circuit in which this contention is ... Well , I am aware of those cases in this circuit , and they do not authorize her to refuse to respond to these questions . Why do n't the three of you come up here right now ? Rachel , Rachel , come on . Come on up . Over here to where the bench is . Miss Armstrong , I want you to understand that if I should order you to reveal your source , that if you do n't
zone3	contempt of court and that you will be jailed until you ... Hold on , Your Honor . Can you rule , please , on my request for a continuance ? Right . I 'm gon na deny that motion . I 'm only asking for a few days , Judge . I understand . There is a serious national security ... There 's no reason not to grant a continuance . Let me run my courtroom . Now , Miss Armstrong , I direct you to reveal the identity of your source . If you want a few days to consider it , I 'll give it to you . I ca n't do that . Mr . Burnside , if you want a few days to advise her to obey my order . I ca n't advise my client to betray a confidence . Okay , look , Your Honor , given the direct threat to our national security , I ask that Miss Armstrong now be held in contempt of court and that she be jailed immediately . Well , it seems to me that I have
zone3	seems to believe that she is above the law itself . I hold you in contempt of court , and I remand you to the custody of the United States Marshal . - Help . - Judge ... Wait . No , no . Your Honor . Judge . Wait ... No , wait . - Ma'am . - Your Honor ! As soon as you 're prepared to speak , you will be released . Could I have a minute with my client to confer ? You may consult with her in the detention center . Timmy needs to be picked up from the Hobermans ' at 5:30 . - This proceeding is closed . - Judge . Judge . Your Honor ! A lot of people looking to get famous here . - So now what ? What do we do now ? - I 'll call you tomorrow . Do n't worry about it . - What are you gon na do now ? - I 'm gon na call you in the morning . All right ? Okay ? Well , at least you 'll take
zone3	's right . - It 's a scare tactic . - You think ? I 'll deal with it . I 'll see you back at the paper . Okay , I 'll head over there . Mr . Burnside , this is a real honor for me . I studied you , growing up . My dad was also a lawyer . This is a big , big mistake , Patton . Well , there 's nothing like learning from our mistakes . Yeah , well , sometimes a mistake is like wearing white after Labor Day , and sometimes , a mistake is invading Russia in winter . Okay , there are two things I need to know . - First , the story itself . - Rock solid . Rock solid . Well , are we talking talc or are we talking granite ? Albert , please . We would n't have put it through - if it was n't ... - Okay . Second , how many people know the ... How many people at the paper know the names of the sources ? We know
zone3	, and one of Rachel 's sources at the FBI gave us a copy of Van Doren 's report . And why do n't you have the name of the original source ? Well , for one thing , Rachel agreed to complete confidentiality , and because her story was confirmed , it was n't necessary to know . Well , the good news is , you ca n't be compelled to testify on something you do n't know . Bosca wallet . Prada sunglasses . - You can keep that . - Thank you . Tape recorder ... I 'm gon na need to get your jewelry . The wedding ring . I 'd like to hold on to those . It 's diamond , baby doll . You do n't want that in there . Miss Armstrong , come up front , please . Take a stand in front of the machine , please . Would you give me your right palm , please ? Take it off . Left , please . It feels like his only real target is Rachel Armstrong for publishing the article ,
zone3	, if we 've got Armstrong in jail , that 's our biggest ace in the hole . Two . The Van Dorens and everyone at the CIA who worked with her have agreed to submit to polygraphs . Jeez , could we turn this guy off ? I ca n't listen to this anymore . Better . You know , that 's the only thing that Armstrong 's got going for her is the media , getting them to turn her into some sort of a cause celeb . We ca n't allow that to affect us . Well , under the Branzburg case , they 've got no chance on appeal . Even if they point out that you did n't exhaust any other possible sources before going to her . Yeah . No , the Miller case made that perfectly clear . - Sit still for the camera . - But our objective , our goal , is not to ... Is not to keep her locked up . I want to let her go . That means we have got our source and we can prosecute
zone3	care about . Sit as still as you can , looking straight ahead . Answer with the word " yes " or the word " no . " Is your name Erica Van Doren ? Yes . - Were you born in Ossining , New York ? - Yes . Have you ever lied on any official document ? No . Did you reveal to Ms . Armstrong you were an employee of the CIA ? You got ta know a few rules . First , ai n't no smoking anywhere in the building . Cigarettes are contraband . No drugs , no fighting . Fighting just buys you time in deseg . - What 's that ? - Desegregation . In the movies , they call it the hole . I 'm taking you to the spillover room . We house the more violent girls in cells . What are you , a doorman ? Get out of here . - Come on . Let me out . - Get out of here . Get out . And ai n't no fucking . No kind of sex at all
zone3	If you 're here for more than eight months , you can apply for a kite or a conjugal . Here you go . But the turnover here is normally two weeks . You wo n't even be here in eight months . Hey ! Hey ! - What 's your name ? - Olivia . - Olivia what ? - Olivia James . - Well , Olivia James , this is Rachel ... - Armstrong . Rachel Armstrong , your new bunkie . Be nice . And show her how to make the bed . There you go . Lights out in an hour . Lights up at 6:00 in the morning . All right ? Okay . Excuse me . Is there any way of seeing a newspaper in the morning ? No . But if you wan na watch the news , you have to convince all of them to do it . - On his birthday , who was driving ... - He ai n't no fool . - I do n't care . - Ai n't no tomming in the yard , you know .
zone3	trained prevaricators , Erica ? You know , they teach you that at Langley ? Box beater . Kicked ass , did n't I ? Who do you think spoke to her ? To Armstrong ? God damn it . I do n't know ! But when you figure it out , just give me five minutes with the prick , okay ? Well , it 's been my experience that Miss Armstrong will tell us . Right . She 's never had her Vassar ass in jail . She 'll break . I do n't know . I met her . I looked her in the eye . She 's a water-walker . I wish we had the cookies , though . Those were pretty good . - Hey . Hey . - Hey . Guess who 's here ? Little man wanted to say hey , make sure you 're okay . All right . Here he is . Say hi . - Hey , baby . Hi . - Hi . Hey . Why do n't you tell Mommy what we brought her ? - Mom .
zone3	they took them away . No way . Well , maybe they 'll let me have them later for dessert . - Dad made them . - Dad made them ? Yucky . Hey , I 'm gon na be okay , sweetie . Hey , how was your spelling test ? It was okay , I guess . I bet you aced it . Practiced really hard , did n't you ? Did n't you ? - Yeah . - You sure did . Hand the phone to your dad , okay ? - Hey . - Hey . Hey . How are you ? - I 'm fine . - Yeah ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Do n't bring him anymore , Ray . - This is not a good place for him . - What are you talking about ? He 's freaking out . He wanted to see you . What do you mean ? He wanted to make sure you were okay . Well , of course he wanted to see me . But ... - I mean , I 'm really serious
zone3	not gon na be here forever . - It 's a couple of days . It 's a few days . - Okay . Okay . So what is going on in the news ? - I have n't heard a thing . - You have n't ? No , there 's no newspapers in here . The TV is perpetually tuned into Jerry Springer . Well , your jailing , your stance , it 's in every newspaper , on every channel . No , no , no . I mean with the President . What have they said about the article ? No , same thing . Same as always . " The White House refuses to comment on intelligence matters . " What else are they going to say ? Right ? I mean , the President , he 's not making any press conferences , that 's for sure . Hey , listen , I was thinking ... I mean , if this gets crazy , crazier , maybe you should tell me who it is . And that way , I can maybe talk to
zone3	a human level , you know ? - Ray . - What ? I 've never asked you , not once . But this is ... This is getting crazy . Okay , let 's not go there . At all . - You do n't trust me ? - That 's not the point . You do n't trust me ? - Is it ... What is ... - I guess that 's it . It 's over . Okay . I miss you . I miss you , too . Can you pass the phone back to ... - Hey , can you hear me ? - Yeah . Okay . I need you to make your bed in the morning . All right ? I need at least one responsible male in the house . - Okay ? Do n't tell Daddy I said that , okay ? - I 'll ... She ca n't hear you , buddy . Okay ? She 'll come home soon . Come on . All rise . Hear ye , hear ye . - Armstrong . Let 's go .
zone3	Court in the District of Columbia will draw near . Give your attention and you shall be heard . Mr . Burnside , your client is here now , so you may proceed when you 're ready . Thank you , sir . Your Honor , I would ask that you would release Ms . Armstrong until such time as the U.S . Court of Appeals can rule on the validity of this contempt citation . Now that would vitiate the whole purpose of her incarceration in the first place . She has the key to her own cell . A key that comes in the form of a loss of integrity is no key at all . Integrity is subjective . Miss Armstrong , I 'm sympathetic , but you 've got ta help me out . Will you represent to me that if you 're home that you 'll pick up the phone and call or contact your source and try to get permission for you to release the source 's name so we can put an end to all of this ? I would be dishonest if
zone3	, you 're really not giving me any basis at all . The motion is denied . Sir , I would ask that the court now impose a fine of $10,000 a day against the Sun Times until such time as Miss Armstrong 's source be revealed . Your Honor , with all due respect to you , this court and Miss Armstrong , we do n't know who her source is . I do n't see how we could be held accountable . Sir , obviously , with the representation on display here , obviously , the paper not only supports , but is encouraging Miss Armstrong 's position . They 're enabling her . The Sun Times should be obliged to obey Your Honor , and dismiss Miss Armstrong if she does not . That is out of line ! Your Honor , respectfully , I ask you to deny this motion . Do n't even think of buckling . Do n't even think it . You pay the fine , and you let Rachel hold strong , exactly the way she 's been doing . You did
zone3	. - I like coming here . - Yeah . - It reminds me why we do what we do . - I agree . You know , my daddy is buried right over there . I feel it best that we not meet at Langley - for the time being . - Yeah . Okay . Yeah . You know , I 'm just glad that you asked to see me . I 've been wanting to speak to you since this all broke . You know , I was hoping I 'd convince you to give me a crack at the CBD in the Balkans . - There 's other business to attend to first . - Okay . Erica , we 've investigated to the fullest degree all of those people who were aware of your cover . We 've looked at phone records , emails , the works . - We 're dead ending here . - Really ? So far , the reporter is in jail and not talking . It 's essential we find out where this leak came from . I know .
zone3	agree with you more . You know , we do n't know if this person had it in for you or had it in for the agency , so can I just pick your brain a little bit ? Yeah , of course . Please . I completely understand . - Ask me whatever you want . - When did you first meet Rachel Armstrong ? Knowingly ? When she came to me at the soccer game , when she confronted me . And you 're both volunteers at Potomac Shores Elementary School , right ? I am . Well , no , I 'm not . I was , but I 'm not now , but she was a room mother there , she said . You never met at school functions before that ? - No . - Your volunteer work never overlapped ? You guys never perhaps talked mom to mom ? No . No . Ever go to a school event where alcohol was being served ? What ? What ? You know , when my wife went to those functions , those let-your-hair-down things ,
zone3	she said that she now wishes she could take back . Sir , wait . Are you still investigating me ? - Well ... - I just passed a polygraph . Well , given your training , I 'm not sure how valuable that is . It is a clinical investigation . You do n't need to take it personally . I do n't need to take it personally ? " We think that you 're either incompetent , a drunk , or a liar , " but you do n't need to take it personally . " How dare you ? - How fucking dare you ? - Okay , - you need to watch your tone here , Erica . - Let me ask you a question , sir . What , in my absolutely unblemished record , can you point to and say , " Yeah , yeah , that 's somebody we ca n't trust " ? - What ? - Point is , I do n't even know you . You 've been a NOC for so many years , there are very few people
zone3	know what ? I know you . I know you , sir . I know your type . I see where this is going . I smell it . You know , if somebody in the CIA messed up , somebody messed up , gave me up and now you guys are walking around investigating it like the Keystone Kops . You 're just aching for it to be me . I see it . This way you can tell the press , " You know what ? It 's not a rogue agent . " It is just some silly little girl whose feelings got hurt " that her investigative conclusions were ignored " by the President of the United States . " Findings that absolved Venezuela from having anything at all to do with the assassination attempt on him . - Now you 're being dramatic , Erica . - Fine , okay . You know what ? You can speak to my attorney from now on . You can drop my protective detail . You can stop cutting me checks . Okay ? I quit . You
zone3	is this , The Sopranos ? I ca n't leave the family ? I 'm stuck ? Well , it 's a process . You 're full of privileged information . You do n't trust me ? Fine , okay . I 'm gon na give you reason not to . Okay ? My husband 's not the only one in the family who can write . Look , you sure you want to get in a war with the government , Erica ? Do you need the messiness ? You 're in the middle of a custody battle , right ? You sure you want to drag Allison into the middle of all this ? You are so lucky you are a woman . Why is that ? Because I do n't hit girls . You know , you were n't the only agent investigating the Venezuelans , but you were the only one that concluded that they were not involved in the attack on the President . Yours is not the only report the President read . I wish you the very best of luck with your daughter
zone3	see her again . Thank you . Yeah , watch this . If there was enough money in the world , I 'd be buying my way out of this . Honey , if there was enough money in the world , I would n't be in here - in the first place . - You got that right . What 's that ? A Christmas present from my son . - How old is he ? - Seven . Shit , ai n't nobody in the whole world seven years old no more . I 'm moving in . That fat piece of shit over there keeps farting all night . About to turn my carjacking beef into a homicide if I stay over there . Well , welcome to the neighborhood . Congratulations , everyone . We have three Pulitzer finalists in our midst . For investigative reporting . Yo , Armstrong . A message for you from somebody named Bunny . I just took it for you . We could n't find you upstairs . So you won something , huh ? I ai n't never won
zone3	school today ? - Okay , I guess . - Yeah ? - What was the best part ? - I do n't know . Hey , I won an award . Though I almost did . A big one , for being a good reporter . - That 's nice . - And the first person I wanted to tell was you ' cause you 're my most special guy . - You want to put your dad back on ? - Okay . Okay . Hey , he really misses you . - Really ? - So , the Pulitzer ? Yeah . You told me , remember ? That 's not that ... Everyone to your bunk ! Shake down ! Lock your hands behind your head . Come on , Armstrong , let 's get to your bunk . Lock your hands behind your head . Shake down ! - Let 's go ! - Let 's go , ladies ! I can find your head by your bunks . - Move ! - Let 's go , ladies ! Let 's go ! Get to
zone3	Jones ? Get to your bunk , now ! You know this is not allowed in here . It 's contraband . Sorry . You been taking these from the IK for weeks . More contraband . Hey , that 's personal stuff . Can I have that back ? What the fuck is this ? You ca n't take that ! - What did you say ? - She ca n't take that . It 's mine ! Get back to your bunk ! You hold that noise , ma'am , or I will take you to the hole ! You understand me ? Lock your hands behind your head . Deseg for you . Fuck . Well , it 's amazing news about the Pulitzer . Congratulations . Yeah . No , that 's great . I just ... I 'm not surprised Tom Williams got it . His story got the mayor to resign . The President is so popular , nobody gave a damn about what I wrote . Well , we 're all proud of you . No , I know . Thanks . I
zone3	, for taking an apple out of the chow house . I ca n't write , and it 's driving me nuts . They took my pen . I ca n't even write to Timmy anymore . I was wondering if you could possibly write an editorial or something , shame them a bit . Yeah , of course . Tomorrow , tomorrow 's paper . Thank you . So , look , Molly Meyers wants to interview you . What ? Why ? I 'm not anorexic . I 'm not in rehab . I 'm not dating Justin Timberlake . Human interest , I guess . Look , she 's a journalist . She has to be on your side , right ? The top dogs are really pushing for it . It 's like you said , no one 's writing about your case anymore . We 're losing traction . The government is n't feeling the public pressure . And the fines and the legal fees are growing . - I get it . Say hi to Avril ... - Do n't think about that .
zone3	get you out in front again , and , for what it 's worth , Molly Meyers will get the eyeballs on you . So ? Okay . But it 's got ta be live . She 's not gon na edit me into a doddering idiot . - Absolutely . - And I 'm not fucking crying , either . All right . What are you wearing ? What is this , the new Cartier ? It 's a wonderful watch . No , it 's not a watch . It 's jewelry . Here , look at here . I 'm suddenly nuts about this de Grisogono . I love the numerals . - All different sizes . Is n't that nice ? - It 's a beauty . - Ready , Molly . - All right , have fun . Okay . They 're telling me it 's gon na be substantive . It 's gon na be serious . - Really ? - Well , that 's what they 're telling me . This will be your moment , not hers . You 'll be great
zone3	I 'm Molly Meyers . - Right , we met once . I interviewed with you to be your research assistant . Oh , no kidding . We are not going to have time for this . If you have time for the Identities Act . Great . If not , so be it . - That 's fine . - One minute . All right . Thank you so much for doing this , Rachel . - And congratulations on the Pulitzer . - It was just a finalist . - Well , bravo . We 're all with you . - Thank you , that 's very nice . Of course , I ca n't say it on the air . Objectivity and all that . All right , ready ? - You know we 're live ? - Todd is gon na toss it to you in three , two ... Thank you , Todd . Rachel Armstrong , thank you for joining us . Rachel , you have been here for seven months . How are you feeling ? Well , physically I feel fine .
zone3	but I feel fine . You know , I look at you and I get this sort of , " How do you do it ? " sensation . Vassar girl , Columbia Journalism , suburban soccer mom ... How Twilight Zone- ish is this for you ? I must say , when I wake up in the morning , it does take me a few seconds to realize where I am . I mean , I have n't grown accustomed to it . You 're married to the novelist , Ray Armstrong . How is the marriage holding up ? - Well , obviously , it puts pressure ... - It must be very hard . It is hard . But we 're strong . You know , he 's very supportive of me , and we 're best friends . That really helps . And what about your son ? Timothy . When was the last time you saw him ? It 's been a long time . How long ? He came to see me when I was first brought here , but I have asked that
zone3	that must be brutal . Most mothers , though , are going to have a hard time understanding . I guess I would have , too , but most mothers would have no idea what they would do unless they were in my position . The truth is , bringing Timmy here would be selfish . You know , it would be for me . And I do wonder a lot if I can survive another day not seeing him , but I know Timmy , and I saw the look in his eyes when he was brought here , and I know the damage that it would do to see his mother in this place , caged up . So , you know , I ca n't do that to him . Rachel , let 's get to the meat of it , because I have to try . On your story , on uncovering the identity of the CIA agent Erica Van Doren , who was your source ? Well , Molly , let me ask you . Why do you have to try ? Try to get
zone3	you know better than that . I know you do . Before the cameras rolled , you said you were , quote-unquote , with me . Look , I have empathy . Like you , I would never give up a source . But you know what ? Sometimes sources have motives . Right , okay . If the information they 're giving is valuable and truthful , like with Watergate or the Pentagon Papers , then their motives really do n't matter . Any real journalist would be prepared to put up with the discomfort of jail to protect their principle . I know you say you would protect your source , as if you 're saying , " There but for the grace of God go I , " and you 're never gon na have to worry about - the government coming after you . - Why ? Because the government really does n't care how you found out where Paris had dinner last night . That 's my bunkie right there , y'all . That 's my bunkie ! Ray . Hey . Hey , Albert
zone3	- Hi , I 'm Gretchen Monroy . - Hi . - So , did you see the Molly Meyers thing ? - Yes . Yes . - Rachel was real terrific . It was great . - Yeah , she was unbelievable . - I 'll catch up with you . - Sure . Nice to meet you . - Look , Albert . - It 's none of my business . No , no , no . No , you do n't . There are things about us that you just do n't ... - When you say " us " ? - Rachel and me . Look , Ray , if you can sleep at night , you can sleep at night . She made a choice . - Choices have consequences . - Yeah , if you think your wife felt like she had a choice in this , then maybe you two should n't be together . Well , you can tell her or not . That 's entirely up to you . Keep up the good work . Excuse me , ma'am . Excuse
zone3	That 's okay . - I 'm looking for the Stein residence . Stein residence ? You know , I do n't know . I do n't think there is a Stein on the block . Harv and Sheila ? Harv and Sheila ... Oh , God . Rachel ? Who do you have working the story ? Evans and Merkow . The shooter belonged to a right wing fringe group . I guess he thought Erica had it in for our beloved President . Name 's Alan Murphy . He 's nuts and stupid . Drove his own car to the murder site , then crashed it half a mile away . Once she resigned from the CIA , she lost her protective detail . God , this is so crazy . Evans and Merkow will want to get a statement from you of some kind . I know . I get it . It 's okay . It 's okay . - How 's Allison doing ? - Who is Allison ? Erica 's daughter . - Bonnie ... - It is not your fault . Am I
zone3	We still have 15 minutes . Judge wants to see her . I 've got a van waiting . The President now seems to feel compelled to get involved personally . He wants to get to the bottom of this debacle . What happened is terrible , and my heart goes out to her little girl , - but it has n't changed my position . - Okay , that 's not what I need . I have here copies of waivers that have been signed by all White House staff and senior CIA . It authorizes you , gives you permission to reveal their names if they were your source . It 's a blanket waiver . That should do it for you . Have a look . See if your source has signed . - These people were obviously coerced . - These people here ? These people have signed of their own volition . Yeah , if you do n't sign these , then we 'll harass you , we 'll investigate you , we 'll make your life hell on earth . I 'm not even
zone3	want some tea ? - Yes , please . - No , thank you . - It 's from Greece . What are we going to do with you ? This has gotten to the point now where my wife is pissed off at me and is telling me that I 'm some sort of bully . Well , you 're not gon na get much sympathy from me there . Your Honor , can I borrow your library for a second ? You think I should look at the waivers . A man can live a good life , be honorable , give to charity , but in the end , the number of people who come to his funeral is generally dependent on the weather . What ? I 'm sorry . I 'm not following . The weather has changed , Rachel . I 'm sorry , but it has . That 's the truth . In the old days , this would have been a lot easier to fight . The public would have called you a hero . But I do n't know , somewhere
zone3	being the white knight , and started being the dragon . That 's the way people see it . You want to know why no paper in this country , including your own , has continued covering your story ? Why do n't you tell me ? Because your 48-hour news cycle dried up months ago . I mean , look at you , Rachel . You look like shit . - Your kid is growing up without you ... - Do n't bring Timmy into this . - It 's not fair . Okay . I 'm a good mother . - Fair ? Fuck fair ! Look , you may not want to bring your son into this , - but I do . You want to know why ? - Why ? Because I 'm defending Rachel Armstrong , not a principle . A man leaves his family to go to jail to protect a principle , and they name a holiday after him . A man leaves his children to go fight in a war , and they erect a monument to him . A woman
zone3	. If we back down , what are we saying , Albert ? " Trust reporters as long as they 're not mothers , because they 'll crack . " The truth is , if I had known that writing this fucking story would have separated me from Timmy , then maybe I would n't have done it . But here we are . The story 's been published , and the path has been chosen , and there 's no way back , and in the end , my son will be fine . You know , Ray is a great father , and Timmy 's gon na be okay , but that will not be the case with my source . My source will be publicly saddled with the death of Erica Van Doren , and that , I promise you , will mean the destruction of the person we 're talking about , and that , Albert , that is not fair . Why ? I mean , your source knew full well the ramifications of speaking to you . My source did n't know what they
zone3	he drunk ? Was he talking in his sleep ? - Hey , take a fucking walk . We 're trying to swim a fucking waterfall here , Albert . We have a responsibility to the shareholders not to go bankrupt . If you 're so worried about that , then I 'll go pro bono from here on in . - How about that ? - Sold . Come in . Okay . I just got off the phone . Stan Riggens has agreed to speak to the grand jury . I guess signing that waiver spooked him . Stan ? - I owe that kid in my office 10 bucks . - When is all this supposed to happen ? As soon as possible . It 'll have to wait until tomorrow morning . Once he confirms he was your source , you 're off the hook . Pack your bags , Rachel . You were chief of staff to the Vice President . I resigned 11 months ago . And were you the source of information provided on the October 6th edition of the Capital Sun Times
zone3	revealed ? I was . Can you tell us all how that came about ? Well , I guess I was just so angry at Erica Van Doren and her husband , - my emotions got the better of me . - I 'm not interested in your motivations . I want to know how you came to reveal this information . I was at a party . ... you guys , it 's muddy right here . I had been drinking . Stan . Hello there , young-ish lady . How are you ? Can I get a beer , please ? Good . Great . Just here with my son . They 're cute now , but they grow up . You know ? So I 've been reading . So I heard Glen invited you . It 's good to see you . Yeah , and you thought , " Well , how can I pass up this opportunity ? " That is exactly what I thought . - Can I ask you a question ? - Anything . Ambassador Van Doren . - What about him
zone3	Stan ? Come here . - Now , look , you did not hear this from me . - Of course not . - Not from me . - Absolutely not . But , everybody knows she 's at the CIA . Everybody . But you ca n't use that . Hey , I wo n't say it came from you , but we 're not off the record . Screw it . Everybody knows anyway . Common knowledge . Do you know if she happened to get out to Venezuela at all ? Wait a minute . Wait a minute . She came to you and asked you if Ms . Van Doren was a spy ? She already knew . That 's right . They 're not satisfied with Riggens . He was just your corroborative source . So was the FBI guy who gave you her report . They still want the original source , which puts us back at square one . Well , how much longer can this go on ? It 's seven months or so before the grand jury is required to disband
zone3	one . I ca n't ... I 'm gon na have to tell the Warden I did this . Look , if you 're gon na be here another seven months , then you should know , in every way how this will affect you . Albert told me . Well , do I get any details ? Details ? Yeah . The details are you 're in here , and whatever it is keeping you in here is more important to you than what 's on the outside . - Well , how long have you been seeing her ? - Just a few weeks . - Do you love her ? - I do n't know . You do n't know ? It 's only been a few weeks . You do n't know her . - What do you do with Timmy ? - What ? When you 're fucking her , what do you do with Timmy ? He 's with a sitter when we go out . - Has he met her ? - No . - Do I know her ? - You do
zone3	She lives in Maryland ... - Okay . You know what , - I do n't want to hear any more . - Look ... Ray , I know this is impossible for all of us . I get it . You 're lonely . I 'm lonely . Look , all you have to do to keep me , to keep my respect , is just tell me it means nothing . That you love me , and that ... I 'd like to see Timmy now . Something you should know is I speak only the best about you to him . All right , do n't patronize me . Okay ? I need to see him , and he needs to see me . - That 's it . - Okay . Okay . I 'll see what we can do . They do n't allow visitation on weekends anymore , and his school routine is pretty locked in . So , now , on top of everything else , you 're gon na try and keep my son from me ? - No . No ,
zone3	what , Ray ? It 's not like you 're cheating on your wife - while she is fucking rotting in jail ? - Keep your voice down . - Rache . - Is that what it 's not like ? - Fuck you ! - Hey ! Hey ! - Fuck off ! - Okay , okay , okay . Go to hell ! It 's okay . Really , this is how you want ... You know what ? Thanks for the fuck , Ray ! That really hit the spot ! Right , ' cause you 're the only one who got fucked by all this . Right ? Hey . What the fuck is your problem ? - You 're in my bunk . - Get a new fucking bunk . - Hey . That 's my stuff ! Stop it ! - Yeah . It 's going down here ! - Hey ! - Get your skanky ass stuff out of my bunk ! - Go get a new bunk ! - Get your ass out of my fucking bunk . This is not your
zone3	bunk ? Your bunk ? You want that bunk ? Huh ? You want that bunk ? You want your fucking bunk now , huh ? Yeah . Come on , leave her alone . Get down ! Get down ! Get down ! Oh , God . What happened ? I got the shit kicked out of me , Albert . That 's what happened . How ? What ? Over what ? - We both wanted the top bunk . - What ? Well , you 've always known the important things to fight for . Are the doctors saying you 're gon na be all right ? Yeah . Whatever that means . You know , I 'm the most senior prisoner in this jail . I 've had 32 different bunk mates since I 've been here . I got ta say , that 's a record . Is that a new tie ? No , I 've had it a while . Domenico Vacca . - I took you for a Kenneth Cole man . - Kenneth Cole ? Well , I 'm glad you
zone3	woman who could use some good news . It 's great news . They 've agreed . They 're going to take your case . It 's gon na be an expedited hearing . The next case this morning is in re Armstrong . We 'll hear first from Mr . Burnside . Mr . Chief Justice , and may it please the court . In 1972 in Branzburg v . Hayes , this court ruled against the right of reporters to withhold the names of their sources before a grand jury , and it gave the power to the government to imprison those reporters who did . It was a five-four decision . Close . In his dissent in Branzburg , Justice Stewart said , " As the years pass , " the power of government becomes more and more pervasive . " " Those in power , " he said , " whatever their politics , " want only to perpetuate it " and the people are the victims . " Well , the years have passed , and that power is pervasive . Ms . Armstrong could
zone3	could have abandoned her promise of confidentiality . She could have simply gone home to her family . But to do so would mean that no source would ever speak to her again , and no source would ever speak to her newspaper again , and then tomorrow when we lock up journalists from other newspapers , we 'll make those publications irrelevant as well , and thus we 'll make the First Amendment irrelevant . And then how will we know if a president has covered up crimes ? Or if an army officer has condoned torture ? We , as a nation , will no longer be able to hold those in power accountable to those whom they have power over . And what then is the nature of government when it has no fear of accountability ? We should shudder at the thought . Imprisoning journalists ? That 's for other countries . That 's for countries who fear their citizens , not countries that cherish and protect them . Some time ago , I began to feel the personal human pressure on Rachel Armstrong , and
zone3	and not a principle . And it was not until I met her that I realized that with great people , there 's no difference between principle and the person . Come on . I got new digs for you . - You know , they brought him out here ... - It 's nothing . He 's not a real person here . - Soccer is n't a real thing here . - They do n't respond to it the same way . - Judge , good afternoon . - It 's just not . Good afternoon , thanks for coming over . Mr . Burnside . We 're talking about soccer not law . Just want you to know . Look , the reason I asked the two of you to come over here today is that the Supremes have decided your case . The ruling will be down on Monday , but I 've been told by a confidential source what it is , and I wanted to share it with you . Five-four , opinion against you , Albert . Same as before . National security
zone3	. And I want to say to you , Patton , congratulations . You did a great job . The court once again has made clear that in a case where journalists are not cooperative , they may have to be incarcerated . Well , thank you , sir . That having been said , I 've decided to let her go . I 'm sorry , sir . What ? I 've got ta let her go . I 've been doing this a lot of years now , and I am sure that this woman is not going to reveal her source . She 's been locked up for almost a year . She has been beaten within an inch of her life . - She is resolute . - That 's exactly right . Exactly right . I can only keep her in jail if I think doing so will get her to reveal her source . She 's not going to talk . I really have no choice but to let her go . If I may . This is a ... This is a woman
zone3	her a criminal . - Oh , come on . She 's not a criminal , and she wo n't be a criminal unless she is duly charged and duly convicted by a jury , and that 's not my call . When are you gon na sign the paperwork , Your Honor ? I want to get her out of there right away . I 'm gon na go to court Monday morning . I 'm gon na announce that I 'm freeing her . And , Patton , you got a choice . You can beat me to the punch . Just dissolve the grand jury . As I 'm sure your attorney has informed you , the grand jury has been disbanded . We 're gon na have to wait till midnight to let you go . Midnight ? What ? You 're keeping the reporters away from your losing cause ? Rachel , I know almost all of it . I am indicting two government officials for talking to you . I wish I knew who it was that first tipped you off , but I
zone3	custody of my kid . You want the wedding ring ? Kind of a trophy . You know , vilify me if you want , Rachel , but I had a job to do , and I had every right to do what I did . I think you 're confusing your rights with your power , Mr . Dubois . It 's okay . We booked you a room at the Mayflower , but you know you 're welcome to stay with me as long as you need . - Thank you . Thanks . - Sure . I spoke to Ray . He 's gon na bring Timmy by first thing in the morning . Thought maybe you would like to take him to school ? Yeah . - That 's okay ? - Yeah . That 'd be amazing . God , I 'm gon na scare him to death , though . And , well , you let me know what you want to do in terms of work . You can if you want to . No one 's going to pressure you about writing
zone3	look in the glove , hand me the insurance and registration , would you ? I was only going 30 . Ma'am , would you please step outside of the car ? - What 's going on ? - We just need you to step out . Not you , ma'am . - Are you kidding me ? - Get out of the car , Rachel . - What 's the problem , sir ? - I ca n't believe this . - What do you want ? - I 'm gon na ask you to turn around , please . - What is it ? What are you doing ? - Hey , hey ! Go easy on her . Rachel , I 'm sorry that it 's come to this . - What is going on ? - Back in the car , ma'am . Rachel , you 're being charged with ... - What 's going on here ? - They 're arresting me , Bonnie . You 're being charged with criminal contempt of court . What does that mean ? Well , it means you
zone3	. - Come on . Let 's go . - Has n't she been through enough ? God damn it . Oh , no . God . Dubois ! Dubois ! Rachel , you 're looking at a possible five-year sentence for impeding a federal investigation , but I do n't wan na go to trial . So , I want to give you a chance to plead this sentence down . I want you to look in my eyes and gauge my sincerity . Use your reporter 's instincts . Okay ? You 're good with those . - I 'm gon na offer you two years . - No . No . No , it 's gon na be suspended sentence , probation . You have to respect what she 's been through . Albert , two years is not as good an offer as it could be , but it 's not as bad , either . Because you 're guilty , Miss Armstrong . You 're guilty as charged , and if you want to waltz into a courtroom in a martyr 's cloak , trust
zone3	have not seen yet . Because this polite , country lawyer demeanor is gon na give way to a wave of self-righteous indignation that you ca n't even begin to imagine . That jury is gon na hear fire-breathing oratory about a country whose security has been compromised , a husband widowed , and a little girl who 's got ta visit her mother 's grave because you wanted to chase a Pulitzer Prize . So , if you force me to take you to trial , I 'm gon na make sure that you do n't make it home - for your son 's high school graduation . - Come on , that 's enough . So , what 's it gon na be , Rachel ? If I agree to this , there is one thing I need . Oh , my God . You have gotten so handsome . You 're a real little man . I 'll bet you got all the girls chasing after you , huh ? No . No ? Well , you will . I do n't care . Whatever . Hey
zone3	- Look , I know you 're mad at me . - No , I 'm not . Well , I think you are , and I have n't let you see me in a long time . - I 'd be mad at me , too . - Well , I 'm not . Okay ? Okay . Look , kiddo , it has n't been easy for me , either . If I 'd known it was gon na go on this long , I would have done things differently . I would have let you see me every single day . I am so sorry . Dad says you could have got out of here many times . Well , your dad is wrong . - Look , kiddo ... - I 'm not a kid anymore . Okay , you know what ? You can pretend not to love me all you want , and I can pretend to believe it , but I love you , and I think about you every minute of every day . Okay ? Dad says you 're going to
zone3	where you are now ? No . This is jail . Jail is where you go when they decide your punishment , and then you go to prison . And what 's your punishment ? - Two years . - That 's a long time . Yeah . But if I 'm well-behaved , then I might get out earlier . So ... Is it dangerous there ? You know what ? If you visit me , come check on me , I 'll be okay . Okay . I 'm kind of busy , but I 'll try . I think we should go now , on account of traffic and all . Hey , hey , how about a kiss ? Just one . Bye . You 're a tattletale ! - I am not ! - You just told on Nicky . That 's because he wo n't stop . - You 're a tattletale . - Timmy , that 's enough . Stop it . - That 's enough . - But you 're not supposed to tattle . Well , you 're not supposed to
zone3	on . Come on . Are you a writer or something ? Yeah , I 'm a reporter . I work for the Capital Sun Times . We get that newspaper . Oh , yeah ? Well , tell all your friends to do the same . - The Internet is killing us . - Mom , how long till we get there ? - About 18 hours , Timmy . - No , Mom , really . I do n't know . I do n't know . My daddy is a writer . - He is ? What does he write ? - He writes articles , though my mom does n't really like what he writes about . - What 's he write about ? - He writes about the President . - What 's your last name ? - Van Doren . Why does n't your mommy like what he writes about ? I heard her yelling at Daddy once . ' Cause he used her secret stuff , she found out . - What she found out ? - When she was in Venezula . Why
zone3	? No , she was working . - Working ? - For the government . But do n't tell anybody it 's me who told you . Okay ? You bet . Subtitles by LeapinLar
zone3	4260330 Let me ask you a question , kid . Did you see that movie Night of the Living Dead ? Brains ! Do you ever wonder about all the different ways of dying ? Eating brains , how does that make you feel ? It makes the pain go away . Send more paramedics . I had no idea that it was gon na have such a long life . Twenty years later , having people go , " Oh , my goodness , " you were Tina in Return of the Living Dead . " I never expected that to happen . The idea that I got to be in a zombie movie and I got to battle zombies was about the most exciting thing that had ever happened to me . Shut up . Christ ! Sick ! All of these people , they were just from here and yonder . Somehow it meshed , and it became a work of art . Dan , who had never directed , I do n't think , before , was open to suggestions from old-timers . A lot of the kids were young and inexperienced . I think a
zone3	He talked Tom Fox into doing the best thing in the world . He talked Tom into paying for a week or two of rehearsal . The picture has that improv feeling because dialogue is snapping all over the place . We rehearsed for a couple of weeks , real tight . And we did it in sequence , just as though you were doing a play . And it was marvelous because we all had an emotional map as we went through the picture shooting out of sequence . We knew where we were emotionally , our timbre of the moment . You know , I think it 's time you tell us what the fuck 's going on . I do n't have ton tell you anything , dickbrain . We think you should . Working with Clu and Jimmy Karen and Don Calfa was such a thrill for me because I was well aware of all three of them and their previous work . I was a huge Poltergeistfan , so Jimmy Karen to me was the guy who moved the headstones but left the bodies .
zone3	of stuff . I had watched in Westerns when I was a kid , so that was really exciting g for me to work with them . Get him off , Frank ! When actors are going down , when their career has more or less come to the sunset , that 's when they take these types of films , in those days . One day I asked the director , Dan , I said , " Dan , how come you chose me for this part ? " He said , " Well , what other leading man would you have chosen ? " I mean , who would you have gotten ? " And I thought and I thought , and I knew he was talking about money and availability and all of that . I said , " You 're right , I ca n't think of anyone . " I was really excited about it when I heard that he was gon na do it , ' cause I 'd seen him do so many marvelous things , and he 's terrific in the picture
zone3	Well , who 's Ernie Kaltenbrunner ? Calfa and I worked together a lot . He played one of the greatest characters I 've ever seen . He had a weapon and a holster like a fast drawer he had a pipe , and it was just so inventive . Dan has a very kinky sense of humor . Weaponry , you know , we talked about it , and he said , " They 'd just do it the best , the Germans . " The weaponry is extraordinary . Originally , he wanted to give me a Broomhandled Mauser , which was sold to the Chinese . Long and unwieldy , you know , pulling it out of a holster . We went with the P-38 . Crazy Don Calfa . Crazy Don Calfa , he was so crazy and so wonderful and is . Burt ? Frank . We have a little problem . When he has a military coat on , he 's playing someone where life and death is involved , there 's no on e better than James Karen . But he can also
zone3	Wan na see them ? See them ? The corpses . I remember being upstairs in the dressing room or the lunch room or something and Jimmy Karen was , you know , down in the warehouse shooting scenes with Thom Mathews . What are we gon na do ? We 're gon na kill it ! We 're gon na kill it ! Screaming and carrying on and , you know , just so over the top and so loud . And at the time , I honestly thought , " I do n't know about this , it 's a little silly . " Part of that came out of the rehearsals . Because Tommy was so young and innocent that I was kidding him all the time . And he was so funny . His reactions were always so funny . That 's how that came up . How many bodies are in here usually ? Well , you know , you do n't want to be overstocked . Kind of like the restaurant business , you do n't want your inventory to lose its freshness .
zone3	Karen , I guess , every day . I always watch the movie and go , " He gets this movie . " I do n't think we got it while we were making it . But it works . It ends up working for the movie . This guy screaming in here , you 're sure he 's a dead cadaver ? Why do n't you open the door and find out ? No , it 's all right , Frank . I 'll take your word for that . We had three very , very experienced actors . There was one other actor I want to talk about named Thom Mathews . What the fuck is Freddy up to these days ? He got himself a job . Oh , no shit ? What job ? He 's a stockroom clerk . Well , yeah , that sound s like a shitty job . Here 's something you do n't see very often . You 're a privileged person These are split dogs . Wow . Yep , for veterinarian schools . Oh , we get a lot
zone3	. Tommy Mathews , he was just such a foil , you know , and he believed anything I told him . All skeletons come from India . No kidding . How come ? How the hell do I know ? He had so many roles to play in that movie , and he was dynamic . What 's it doing in there ? I do n't know . It sounds sore What are we going to do ? The three or us said , " Yeah , yeah , " and he started acting . And we kind of reared back and he was keeping up with us . We said , " He ca n't do that . " You have no pulse , your blood pressure is 0/0 . You have no pupillary response , no reflexes , your temperature is 70 degrees . Are you saying we 're dead ? Let 's not jump to conclusions Are you saying we 're dead ? No , obviously I ... I had been working so hard to become an actor and it was just , you know ,
zone3	As quiet and shy , perhaps , as he is , he knows what to do and he goes for it . I can finally see the one thing and one thing only that can relieve this horrible suffering . What , Freddy ? What ? Live brains ! It was , you know , the scenes where it 's , " Oh , Freddy , Freddy , " the whole time , and then we just kind of laugh and someone would make a joke afterwards . She was from the good side , little miss goody two-shoes and stuff . She is one of the sweetest women in showbiz . You know , when you 're an actress and you 're young , you get a lot of scripts to look at , and you go , " That one looks good , that one 's ... " This one , for some reason , I wanted really badly . I saw what Beverly went through and Beverly went through a lot . At the time I was so skinny , ' cause , you know , you
zone3	I was freezing and it was just muddy and yucky . Mister , there 's a hundred of those things out there . That was rough , that was hard . You know , she really toughed it through . It 's amazing . I had done a film a couple of years earlier , The Last American Virgin , which has its own very different cult following . And because of that , I played the nerd in the movie , much closer to my real sel f than Scuz was . And my agent would only send me out for nerd roles . So , a dear friend of mine , actress , was up for Beverly Randolph 's role . So I called my agent , said , " Look , I know they 're casting for this movie right now , " because my friend has gone in on it a couple of times , " and I really want to go in on this role . " And he finally said to me point blank , " You know , Brian , you 're not
zone3	, you know , these are like guys with Mohawks . " And I auditioned and called back and eventually got the role , which was sort of the ultimate revenge on my agent . The rock hounds , I just thought they were marvelous to look at . I mean , that crazy hairdo that Brian had ... Dan O'Bannon was very determined to have blood shoot out of someone in a Shamu the whale-like blow hole , geyser . I do n't know , he just really wanted blood to go everywhere . Kenny Myers took a mould of the side of my head , made this acrylic plate that you can glue directly onto my scalp , and it had this little metal nozzle that was gon na shoot the blood out of it . And they were literally able to hide it in my Mohawk hair . And then that plate had a tube that ran down behind my ear , down my neck , and then went down my shirt and down my pant leg , and then went to , you know , a
zone3	. At the point that we finally filmed it , the crew literally was wearing plastic ponchos , and they said , " Action . " There was nothing that was n't covered in blood by the time that scene was over . I compared it to going into the army , ' cause it was like boot camp to me . ' Cause I was , like , " I 've got ta make it through . I 've got ta make it through . " I think it was tougher for us girls than the guys , they 're a little bit stronger , and maybe a little warmer at night . It was hard to dance naked on a tombstone because I had everybody down there and I was up there . I did have this piece which was called a Barbie Doll piece . It was kind of like a G-string sort of piece and they glued it on . So every time I had to go to the bathroom , I 'd be like , " Hello , somebody unglue me . " Linnea 's
zone3	d her just due . Boy , she 's talented . Who 's there ? Brains ! Well , I auditioned for the role just like all the other actors did . It was n't anything special . I remember going into the audition and being told , " Well , this is a little bit different . It 's not a regular kind of a role . " I remember Dan saying that he really wanted to see the Tarman character thinking . He did n't want it just to be this big lumbering monster . And the other thing he told me , of course , was about the physicality . That he was just sort of being held together by good and hardly anything at all That if he would make the wrong move , he would just completely fall apart That whole movement that he did , that dancer 's body that he has ... In my mind , it 's sort of a feeling like , " Well , if I lean a little bit too far one way or the other , I 'm
zone3	'll be the end of it . " So , it was sort of like this .. I remember thinking of it as sort of a balancing act Like if I went a little too far , I would fall over but if I just sort of kept everything ... It 's like , you know , when you balance a broom in your palm of your hand , it 's that type of thing . And that 's sort of what was going through my mind in terms of the movement , I guess . I did n't see Allan before . I think they had put up drapes because Dan wanted me to be very scared when I saw this ... Brains . ... outfit he was wearing . And so I did n't get to meet him . I did n't get to see anything until we actually shot this . And it was good . It was a great costume . It was wonderful . And his body movements were so unique that you just could n't help but react to it . That poor ,
zone3	time . It was very intense , actually . It got to a point where inside I 'd be crying and I 'd be very upset , and then it came to a point where the waterworks would n't work anymore . There were no tears in my eyes and I 'm thinking , " Oh , no , Dan is gon na kill me . " And so I went to the makeup woman , Robin . I said , " Robin , I ca n't cry anymore . I ca n't get any tears out . " And she started blowing peppermint in my eyes and that did n't work . There just was no more water left . And then , Don Calfa , gave me some music to listen to in the attic scene , and that really helped , and for some reason water found its way to my eyes . I put together a tape , which I used on a number of occasions , of different pieces of music . You know , some of them obvious . Samuel Barber , John Lennon
zone3	and it would break me up . I , you know ... I just gush . I do n't think I probably cried for a couple of years after that , but it was intense and it was good . They left us , those jerks ! They left us ! They had to . Give me brains ! Brains ! People always ask me , " Where do you get the zombies ? " Well , get them out of central casting , right ? Well , yeah . Unless you find them on the street . My favorite zombie was a guy without legs He 's on Hollywood Boulevard , he used to be , making his money They found him , said , " You want to be in a movie ? " He said : " I 'm in a lot of movies . " " Well , this is a horror movie . " " I 'm in a lot of horror movies . " " Well , you 'd be kind of featured in this . " " Ah ! " But he said
zone3	. I wan na walk on my own . " And he started doing this ... And walking on his knees , he had little pads on , and walking . He walked until he fell . And they used that cut . It was really , really weird and terrifying . The zombie without legs , it worked . Linnea , you know .. That was very rough , we were ... The stuff was shot at night mostly in the cold and wet and she was so exposed In L.A . it gets pretty cold at night , and you 're just standing there going , " Okay , they 're counting down , " one , two , three , and the rain 's gon na hit me , " and I 'm gon na be freezing forever now , all night long . " And being buried in mud , and all kinds of things like that . I actually got strep throat from it all . Her scene is a very intense scene , and the extras were very rough on her . Extras fascinate
zone3	overly zealous . They 're all on top of me and I was in the mud , too , you know , being drowned , like , " Hey , I 'm under here and I 'm really a person " , you know ? I was getting tired of being wet , and there was just ... There was nothing more for me in the movie except to run around outside and wait for the nuke in the rain . And I thought , " Gee , I 'm too old for that . I do n't wan na do that . " I 'll get arthritis or something . " So I went to him and said , " You know , " I think he 's revolted He does n't wan na be . " a living corpse , a zombie " " I wonder if I could kill myself " in the crematorium . " And he said , " Well , how could we work it ? " " ' Cause I 'm such a wisenheimer anyway , I could turn to Tommy and say
zone3	goddamn thing . Later , when I escaped from some room , I think the chapel or something , and I escaped and I ran into the crematorium , and Dan wrote that scene , and he said , " Keep the crematorium , do n't destroy the set " . The scenes we shot in the cemetery were really , really cool because it was this olive grove out in Sylmar , and it was a very , very , very impressive set . I mean , as good as it looks in the movie , it was honestly more impressive in person . It was laid out , you know , as this huge interior cemetery . I mean , from the front gat e to the walkway past that kind of Civil War canon , down the road , and there were tombstones everywhere , there was Spanish moss hanging from all the trees , to the mortuary facade . They put in a paved road and a parking lot . That little hill that the front of the mortuary is on , they built and planted
zone3	you went up to the door of that mortuary and opened it , it was just a flat , and what you saw behind it was a pasture full of cows . And I can remember filming there at night , and we 'd be doing our dialogue and we 'd hear ... Just cows back there . And the whole place smelled like cow crap . Christ , I never smelled anything like that before . Dan O'Bannon is a genius . A genius writer , and I must say , he must be a genius filmmaker . After it came out , I realized what a difficult balancing act had been carried out by this film . That , you know , there 's a point where too much is not funny anymore , but just enough is right . It 's like you look at our cast , everybody is so different and so unique . So off-the-wall , even , and I think that 's what keeps this movie going . I got off a boat on a little Island in Greece , and somebody was
zone3	saw me , said , " More brains , more brains . Send more cops ! " These fans , it 's 20 years later ... There 's one fellow , Jason , who had us autograph his arm , and he tattooed our autographs . I 've done over a hundred pictures now and I just have never had an experience like that before . I loved it and , curiously , of all the pictures I 've done ... I 've done some pretty good one's , actually , some respectable one's . This is the one I 'm known for . I have worked and worked and worked as an actor , and how many works of art ? Probably five out of over 500 I 've done . But what do you mean by works of art ? Return of the Living Dead is what I mean , that 's what I 'm talking about . Return of the Living Dead is a work of art by man . How it got here , I do n't know . Should it have gotten here ? Not
zone3	You bet I am .

zone3	what , Darren ? Like , what 's your point ? Darren : You , you 're trying to tell me that you do n't know what crawberg is ? Okay , guys , it 's time for me to fill you in on one of the most notorious moments in pilgrim history . Back in the 1500s , in the settlement of crawberg , an old Indian by the name of feather cloud , who some people thought had black magic powers , was dishonored by a pilgrim . Ali : Oh , my ex-boyfriend was a pilgrim . Darren : The pilgrim 's name was Chuck Langston . Billy : Well , that 's my last name . Darren : I know , Billy . I 've never thought about it before , but he 's probably one of your ancestors . Well , anyways . The old Indian was so outraged , he vowed he would curse all white men . This was no ordinary curse , however . Feather cloud necromanced a ... Turkey that would roam the earth every 505 years , killing the first
zone3	than anything you 've ever seen before ... a Turkey that would stop at nothing to get what he wanted ... To kill . Billy : Are you shitting me ? A killer Turkey ? Johnny : Bullshit , Darren . You 're starting to scare kristen now . Kristen : I 'm not scared . Ali : I 'm scared . Darren : Well , it 's kind of a legend , guys . There are tons of books written about it . It 's a pretty famous story . Turkeyologists all over the world ... Johnny : Oh , brother . Darren : Know it as thankskilling . Johnny : Let me guess , it 's been 505 years later , right ? Darren : No . It will be in 45 minutes . Ali : Come on , I mean , it 's totally impossible for a Turkey to kill a human ... Right ? Johnny : Yeah , yeah it is . Darren : [Chuckles] Oh , there are ways . I guess we 'll just have to wait and find out . Johnny : Damn
zone3	this is not cool for you to scare us like this . I mean there are girls here . Billy : There sure are . Darren : I 'm getting wasted . Because kristen told me that I could have a good time . Billy : No , you 're not . Did you pay for that beer ? I do n't think so . Kristen : Well , uh , since there are only so many tents , do you want to spend the night with me , Johnny ? Johnny : Gee , kristen , I 'd love to . I mean , I could protect you , just in case you got scared or something . Ali : I have a free spot in my tent , too , Johnny . Oscar : Flashy ? [Dog_yelping] Flashy ? Flashy ! Your dog had an accident . Oscar : What the hell ? What kind of accident ? Well , I took this here ax and I ax-identally cut him . Get it ? Ax-ident . [Laughs] Oscar : Die , Turkey , you demon ! So long
zone3	Turkey ! I will get you if it 's the last thing I ever do , you son of a bitch ! Why , why ? ! First my wife , now you , flashy ! Damn you , Turkey , damn you ! Ali : [Yawns] It 's getting late . Kristen : This was fun , guys , but I think it 's time to hit the sack . Billy : Then go to bed after that . Right , guys ? Darren : Yeah ! I got it , Billy . That was a good one . Kristen : Shit ! I forgot to call my dad . Shit , shit , shit . He 's probably worried sick . I 'll be right back , I do n't have service right here . Johnny : Be careful . Billy : Yeah , and do n't wander off too far . There might be an evil Turkey on the loose . Roud : Where have you been , kristen ? I 've been waiting around two hours ! Kristen : Sorry , daddy , our car broke
zone3	. I 'll be back on the road first thing tomorrow though , and I 'm totally fine , so do n't worry . Roud : Promise , punkin ? Punkin ? Kristen : Yes , yes , I promise , daddy . I 'll see you tomorrow . We 'll go to that banquet together . Roud : Be careful . Kristen : Love you , bye . Roud : Love you , bye . Kristen : Okay , girl , get a grip . There is no such thing as an evil Turkey . There is no such thing as an evil Turkey . There 's ... No such thing as an evil Turkey . Oh , wait , I lied . Kristen : [Screaming] Shut the fuck up ! You stupid bitch ! I 'm gon na drink your blood like cranberry sauce , meanie . Johnny : Jesus , kristen , what happened to you ? ! Kristen : You were right , Darren ! Your story was true . There is an evil Turkey on the loose ! Billy : [Laughs] Ali : Wow ,
zone3	as I am . Darren : Yeah , it was just a story , kristen . I doubt it 's even true . Johnny : Shut up , you guys ! I think she might be serious . Billy : [Laughing] Darren : [Laughing] Johnny : Where 's the Turkey ? Kristen : I do n't know . He was right behind me . He was chasing me . I do n't know where he went . Johnny : Well , I do n't see anything . Let 's just go to bed . Everything 's gon na be okay . Kristen : You do n't believe me , do you ? Johnny : I do believe you . Kristen : Look me in the eyes . Do you believe me ? Johnny : I ... Kristen : Out of everybody here , I thought you would believe me ! Screw you , Johnny ! Billy : [Laughing] Ali : You can screw me , Johnny . Eeeee ! Darren : Whoa ! Ali : Oh , look , it 's a baby bunny . Do you think he 's
zone3	, does n't he ? Darren : Yeah ! That 's because his stomach got gnawed open . Look at all of his guts hanging out . This little baby bunny got its stomach gnawed open by a beak . Not just any beak ... A Turkey beak . Billy : Fuckballs ! Maybe kristen was right . Johnny : Look , guys . Just calm the " f " down . Jesus , we 're in the woods . This type of shit happens all the time . Let 's just go to bed . Billy : Yeah , demonic turkeys . Gutted animals . Yeah , let 's sleep on it . Great idea . Darren : Well , I 'm tired . I 'm pretty wasted anyway , so , uh , goodnight , all . Billy : So , looks like it 's just the two of us . Ali : Do n't even think about it , Billy . You can feel up your own boobs tonight . Billy : Well , what about tomorrow ? Ali : I 'll think about it . Good
zone3	Oscar : You can just call me your guardian angel , kid . That damn Turkey come along last night and was ready to peck your heart out . Oscar : You 're crazy ! Oscar : Am I ? Then what 's them Turkey droppings doing on your chest , son ? Billy : Oh , gross . Oh , God . Oscar : See , I told you . That goddamn Turkey was out here last night , killed my precious dog , flashy . I think he 's out to get all of us . Johnny : Who the hell is this creepster ? Buzz off , old man . Oscar : Trust me , kid . Leave this cursed place now . I 'll take care of that goddamn Turkey . [Chuckles] Johnny : You alright ? Billy : Yeah , I 'm fine . Can we just get the girls up and get going ? This place is giving me the heebie-jeebies . Johnny : Yeah , that 's good . Look who 's scared now . Darren : [Laughs] [Engine_turns_over] Johnny : Billy !

Can we just shut up about it ? Johnny : Oh , my . Wait , wait , so you actually believe that there is a real killer Turkey on the loose ? What a loser , God ! Billy : Well , I know it sounds crazy , but , yeah . I woke up with Turkey deuce all over me . I think he was trying to kill me , but that old hermit saved me . Ali : You 're a freak , Billy . A freak ! But I believe your story . Kristen : I 'm not gon na say anything . Darren : Wow . I did n't think that my story would have this much of an effect on you guys . I mean , you 're the cool kids , right ? Johnny : Whatever .

zone3	. Yeah ! Are n't you gon na introduce me to your friends ? Kristen : Of course . This is Johnny . Johnny : Hey , how you doing ? Kristen : And Darren . Darren : happy Thanksgiving , sheriff . Kristen : And Billy . Billy : Hi . How are you guys ? Kristen : Dad , we need to use your collection of books . Would you mind showing us to the garage ? Um , of course , yeah , no problem at all . I mean ... Where is it again , honey ? Kristen : Oh , dad , you and your rapidly fading memory . Darren : Excuse me , sir . Kristen : Well , guys , here it is . I 'm sure we 'll be able to find something in here . What is it that you kids are looking for ? Darren : Well , actually , sheriff , there 's this book that ... Kristen : Oh , nothing , daddy . I got poison Ivy yesterday and I 'm looking for a cure . Oh
zone3	: Thanks , daddy . I 'd die if was n't for you . More like you will die if it was for me . Kristen : What was that , daddy ? Oh , nothing at all . Darren : So , kristen , tell me , why did n't you tell your father about the killer Turkey ? Kristen : Maybe ' cause he 'd never believe us in a million years . I was just trying to avoid a long conversation . Darren : That 's right . That makes sense . Johnny : Alright , guys , let 's get to work . Darren : Guys , I found it . Billy : It 's about time . God , that took forever . Kristen : That was five minutes . Darren : Whoa , guys . Look ... right here , it says the Turkey can be killed if he is removed from his magical talisman . Johnny : I do n't know , guys . I never noticed any magical talisman . Kristen : He probably keeps it hidden under his feathers . Darren
zone3	right . Look ... this is what it says . If the talisman is not in plain view , then it is very probable that the Turkey keeps it in his plumage . Johnny : Great . All we have to do is catch him , remove his stupid thingie , and he 's dead ? Kristen : I think we still have to kill him . Darren , does it say if there 's some special way to that ? Darren : See , that 's the problem . The rest of this book is written in code . It 's a mathematical code , so I think I can crack it . No , I know I can crack it . Billy : God , I hate books . Ca n't it just tell us what to do ? Kristen , do you have any snacks or anything ? I 'm starving . I do n't know , Billy . How can you be thinking about food at a time like this ? Billy : Well , I 'm hungry . Darren : Billy , just go outside
zone3	'll figure this out . Johnny : You got it yet ? Darren : Just ... [Whispering_indistinctly] Johnny : Hurry up . Darren : Johnny . Billy : Where is the fucking kitchen ? I 'm fucking starving . I just want some food . Oh , hey , sheriff . What you got there ? Oh , just tidying up . Nothing to see here . Billy : If that 's the sheriff , then you must be Turkey ! Guys ! Come on , come quick , the Turkey 's here ! [Laughs] You kids are retarded . Darren : Leave us alone ! Why are you bothering us ? ! Kristen : Daddy , no ! Shut up , I do the talking , faggot . A long time ago , one of your ancestors disrespected our people really , really badly . And so as payback , I 'm here to kill any white person that disrespects Indians or our land . Johnny : But we gave your people land , and we let you have casinos . Does n't that make up for what our
zone3	did n't . Prepare to be dead ! You fat bastard ! Billy : Quit just standing there , guys , grab his fucking thingie ! Johnny : Got it ! Kristen : Now what do we do , Darren ? Darren : I do n't know ! I have n't figured out the equation yet ! [Laughs] Kristen : God damn it ! Douche bags ! Billy : All that work for nothing ? You guys suck sometimes . Kristen : It was n't for nothing , Billy . We got the talisman . Now we can kill him . Billy : God , I 'm so tired of this stupid Turkey just playing games with us , like we 're some kind of puppets . Whatever , I 'm out of here . Darren : Be careful , Billy , you know he 's still out there . Johnny : Well ... he 's dead . Kristen : Do n't say stupid shit like that . Now , Darren , do your magic . Darren : Alright . Johnny : I 'm sorry for your loss , kristen
zone3	this mess . Things will never be the same again . It 's all my fault . Kristen : It 's not your fault . There are just some things in life we ca n't control . And unfortunately , this is is n't like a football game where we can just call an audible at any time . Johnny : You 're right . Life is not like a playbook . I just got to roll with it . Life moves on . Kristen : I just wanted to let you know , Johnny , that I really appreciate everything you 've done for us . You can be my quarterback any day . Johnny : Oh , kristen . Darren : Hey , guys ... whoa . Hey , guys , whoa , um , I cracked the code . I know how to kill the Turkey now . Kristen : So , what does it say ? Well , basically it tells me everything we need to know to kill him . And I 'm just figuring that 's why the code was so hard to break
zone3	told us anything yet . Darren : Oh , right . Okay , so , we need to burn him at the stake , just like a witch . And then we need to say a demonic prayer in unison backwards . Just the usual thing . Johnny : Damn ! This shit is not gon na be easy . Darren : No shit , it 's not gon na be easy . He was necromanced by one of the most powerful Indians in history . Kristen : We got to do what we got to do . Johnny : First thing we have to do is find out where this Turkey 's at . Darren : It says here , " if the " Turkey is nowhere to be seen , it 's likely he 's returned to his " teepee . " Johnny : Shit , there ca n't be that many teepees in town , can there ? Let 's go blitz his ass . Darren : " However , if he is " not in the teepee , he 's killing " one of your friends
zone3	: So hungry . God damn . Oh , Billy ! Billy , Billy , Billy , come eat me ! Come eat me , Billy . I taste real good . Billy : That hit the spot . [Belches] Oh ! Gobble , gobble , motherfucker . Now that 's what I call " fowl " play . [Laughs] Johnny : I think we 're too late . Darren : Holy shit ! Guys , pull over ! Pull over , there 's Billy ! There 's Billy , pull over , God damn it ! No ! Billy ! Billy ! My buddy , my best friend ! No , you ca n't go like this ! Billy , you ca n't go like this , man . Billy : It 's okay . You 're one of the cool kids now . Darren : It 's not even that bad , Billy . I am one of the cool kids , because of you . Because of you , I 'm one of the cool kids ! You 're my best friend . We 've been through
zone3	, Billy . It 's not gon na end like this . There 's gon na be many more good times . And we 're not gon na let there be a lot of bad times . You 're my best friend . I 'm going to fucking kill that goddamn Turkey . I swear to fucking God . Billy ! Billy , no , you ca n't go ! It 's not even that bad . It 's not even that bad . Billy , I love you . You 're my friend . I 've never had anybody come into my life like you , Billy . Remember when you gave me my first ice-cream cone under the sunset ? I miss you so much , Billy . This song goes out to you . Oh , yeah . Mmm . Yeah , I love you , Billy . * and now you 've gone and left me * * you were my , you were my friend * * my friend * * you got killed by the Turkey * * who 's not , who 's
zone3	, yeah * * oh Billy , Billy , Billy , you were my , my best friend * * we were meant to be best friends forever * * and now you are a dead best friend * * a dead best friend * * Billy , why did you have to leave me , Billy * * why did you have to leave me * * you were my best friend , Billy * * best friend , Billy * [classical_music_playing] Oh , yeah . Tossing . Perfect . Low in calories , high in fiber . Toss it . Whew , nothing like a long day to have a big juicy salad in my stomach . Kristen : There 's the teepee , guys , on the side of the road . Darren : Okay , guys , so , what are we gon na do now ? Johnny : Fuck , I do n't know . I did n't really think about that . Kristen , what do you got ? Kristen : I do n't know . Do we have any rope ? Johnny :
zone3	I thought it could be useful . Kristen : Okay , well , this is a start . Darren , how about Johnny and I go in through the main entrance and we can distract Turkey . Then all you have to do is go in through the back , sneak up on him , nail him , and tie him up with this rope . Darren : So I 'm doing all the work ? Johnny : Do you want to avenge Billy 's death or not ? That 's what I thought . Now quit being a pussy and let 's make this happen . Darren : Fine , fine , I 'll do it . Kristen : Wait , do we have matches or a lighter ? Johnny : Yeah , I got a lighter right here . I 'm always prepared , baby , and when I 'm not , I just call an audible . Darren : Okay , well , let 's kick this foul-mouthed bastard 's ass . Johnny : Let 's do it . [Music_continues] [Record_scratches] You 're not such a badass
zone3	badass . Johnny : You bastard , I 'm gon na fucking kill you . Kristen : Not now , Johnny . What do you think you 're doing ? You kids ca n't kill me , assholes ... I 'm invincible . Oh , shit ! What the fu ... ? What are you going to do ? Catch a fish , you fucking prick ? Darren : I got him ! What ! What , Turkey ? ! Johnny : Good job , man . Darren : Oh my God , I 'm on fire ! What is this ? Looks like I got something you do n't got , Turkey . What 's that , Darren ? A vagina ? Darren : Fuck , no ! I 've got a book that 's gon na send you straight to hell . You think that 's real ? You kids are even more retarded than Billy ! Johnny : Go back , go back ! Kristen : Calm down , Darren . Johnny : Do n't listen to him , Darren . Let 's just finish this bastard
zone3	've got to find the fucking prayer . I 've got it . You ready ? Johnny : Let 's do this . Darren : Let 's do it . All : Ashlashi begundi ka . Blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , fucking blah . All : Kribash sholash kari mafesto . This is the stupidest thing you kids have done yet . All : Ashlashi begundi ka . Kribash sholash kari mafesto . Oh , what are you ... All : Ashlashi begundi ka . Stop ! Stop it ! All : Kribash sholash kari mafesto . Darren : There , guys ! Johnny : At least it 's working . Darren : Yeah , that should 've worked , because now he 's lost all of his invincibility power . Okay , it says here , he 's now ready to be sacrificed . Fuck , burn him alive , guys . Kristen : Nice , you still got that lighter , Johnny ? Johnny : Yeah , I got it . Kristen : I 'm ready to see this cock burn . Johnny
zone3	, I mean like a dick , not like the animal . Do you have the lighter or not ? Johnny : Yeah , I got it . So long , suckers . [Laughs] Oscar : Not this time , asshole ! Oh , fuck ! Argh ! [Coughing] Johnny : You ! Where did that Turkey go ? Oscar : I killed that son of a bitch . He 's right in that dumpster right over there . Kristen : You do n't understand , he needs to be killed in a certain way . If he is n't , who know what might happen . Johnny : Bastard . Kristen : Oh , yep , he 's dead . That 's pretty nasty . Oh , shit . Kristen : Nice shot , hermit . Oscar : Thank you there , pretty lady , but it was pretty much point-blank range . Johnny : Yeah , it was . Oscar : Well , looks like my work 's done here . Killed that goddamn Turkey , and avenged the death of my dog , ol ' flashy .
zone3	dog . That must be hard to deal with . Oscar : Well , I know he 's in a better place now , but it still hurts a little bit on the inside . One of these days , you kids there , you might feel what I feel when losing somebody you love , like your mother , your father , or your best friend . Well , I 've got to go , kids , here . You guys have a good night . Johnny : Well , I sure learned a lot from this experience . And I made lifelong friends . Kristen : What a nice guy . Johnny : I do n't know . He fucking kind of creeps me out . Kind of weird . I do n't know , though , he did save our lives . I guess that makes him cool , right ? Darren : Well , guys , we just killed the most demonic Turkey to ever roam the face of the earth . What now ? [Laughter] Johnny : We did , did n't we ? Darren
zone3	do n't think we can do anything to top this one . What do you say we go back to kristen 's and watch the movies ? How does that sound ? Darren : Hell , yes . Hell , yes . Kristen : Come on , guys , it 's through here . Johnny : Let 's rock this movie . Darren : I want to watch it . I 'm so excited . Johnny : Got my popcorn , all snuggled up on the couch . So , you know , kristen . In a way , I 'm kind of glad all this happened . If not , I would n't have gotten this close to you . I may have lost my parents , but I gained a girlfriend . Kristen : G-girlfriend ? Darren : Oh , brother . Kristen : You mean ... Johnny : Yes . Will you go out with me ? Kristen : Oh , Johnny , I do n't know what to say . I mean , I do know what to say . Yes , of course . Johnny

[Laughs] Kristen : What 's the matter , Johnny ? Johnny : I do n't know . I thought I heard Turkey . I could n't have . It just ... It just must have been a bad dream . Kristen : There is no way , Johnny , he had a shotgun wound the size of my head . Plus , we said the prayer in reverse . Johnny : Yeah , you 're right . He 's got be dead . Unless he fell into some radioactive waste . What are the odds of that happening
zone3	that kind of stuff only happens in movies . Johnny : You 're right , you 're right . Well , I 'm going to go check on Darren . I 'm still a little freaked about that dream . Kristen : There is nothing to be worried about , Johnny . Remember that . Okay , I 'll be right back . Johnny : Darren ? Darren , this is n't funny . Where you at , man ?

zone3	mean , who is this freak ? - Why would you leave your number ? Are you a complete idiot ? I did n't want anyone going to the police ! Just leave her alone , all right ? She was just being Mel . How do we know this guy 's for real ? How do we know he 's not punking us like some sick joke ? Hello ? Hello ? Is anybody out there ? Hello ? Is anybody there ? Goldilocks ? Yes . Yes , I 'm here . Who are you ? You can call me ... Rusty Nail . Can I speak to Bobby ? Please ? L-I need to know that he 's okay . Oh , my God . Bobby ! Bobby ! Okay . It 's okay . You do what I asked ? Yes . I got the cell phones . Line ' em up in front of the car . No way ! I waited two days in line for this phone . Do it . Nowl - No . - Move ! - How 's he gon
zone3	He 's probably watching us . How do you know he 's watching us ? How do you know that ? Okay . Start the car and drive forward . Do n't do it , Melissal Do n't do it , Melissa . - I have to . - If you do it now , he 'll know he can do anything he wants . This is fucking insane ! Do n't do it ! Fuck ! Okay , it 's done . You follow everything I say to the letter . You do that , I promise you 'll all be reunited soon . Do n't get no ideas of separating ' or goin ' for help . Okay . We 'll do whatever you want . Whatever you want . - Jesus . Make sure you tickle his balls while you 're at it . - Shut up , Nik ! What do you want ? Remember when your girlfriend there threw her drink at my rig ? That was him ? He 's one of them . He 's a fucking trucker ! She gave me something
zone3	do n't understand . She gave me the finger . Now I want it . She gave it to me , I figure it 's mine to keep . What ? My finger ? I 'll let you know the place and the time . You just make sure it 's freshly cut . And if you do n't show up , well ... things will not go well for your boy here . And , Goldilocks ? Yes ? I want you to bring it to me . It 's time we met ... in the flesh . I ca n't believe this is happening . I swear to God , we 're gon na find him . - We can figure this out . How smart can this guy be ? - He said he had eyes everywhere . That 's impossible . I mean , he can use his C.B . to ask his fellow road zombies if they 've seen this car . I mean , it 's pretty unique . It 's probably how they found us in the first place . And he almost
zone3	ca n't go to the cops . - How do you know all this stuff ? - Dad used to be a trucker . Let 's just say , not a fan . - He could be in any one of them . - It does n't make sense for him to follow us ... until we meet him in ... three hours , with Kayla 's severed finger . We are not cutting off my sister 's finger . My point is , is he 's got to have something to do between now and then . Otherwise , he would 've asked us for it right then and there , right ? - Okay . - So , if he 's not following us now ... and we stay away from trucks and police , maybe we can find ourselves some time to maneuver . - He may be right . - Thank you . - What if he 's wrong ? - Hell , it 's not my funeral . Hey , you know what ? Why would you say something like that ? - Sorry .
zone3	we should just get him what he wants . - I 'm not going in there . - Nobody 's asking you to . I 'll go . You know I can handle blood . No . You know what ? This is my fault . I got ta do this . - I need you to come with me . - For what ? Wait . Go wait with Mel . Fuck . What 's with the whole " okay with blood " thing ? Forget about it , all right ? No , seriously , you go to , like , med school , or just a lot of P.M.S . What part of " forget about it " is confusing you ? Shit . Shit . - My God . Kayla . Kayla ! - Oh , shit . Shit . Oh , God . Fuck , I 'm gon na go . I 'm gon na go . Thank God . - Did you get it ? - Yeah . I got a scalpel , too , just in case . - Great . - Let

That 's the guy . - He 's coming for the fucking finger . - I do n't have the keys . - I left them right here ! I do n't know where the keys are . - Let 's go ! Come on , man ! You ca n't park here ! Police escort vehicles only ! How many times do I have tell you ? Sorry . We 're really sorry . We did- It 'll never happen again . - Sir . - Yeah , sorry . Sorry , Mr . Lurch . I 'm not-I 'm not so sure about this . Relax . Everything 's gon na be fine . Oh , great . Yeah , as long as we have the power of positive thinking on our side . I think this is it .

I 'll - I 'll do whatever you say . At my signal , come up to the cab ... and give me what 's mine . And then you 'll let Bobby go ? You do what I say ... and I promise you 'll see him again . Do it now . And , Goldilocks ? Make it slow . I want to enjoy this . Now why do n't you show me that pretty little ring of yours ? - Oh , this is so messed up . - Just keep moving .

No , you didn't . - I saw you down at the funeral parlor . - Mel , what is going on ? There 's a big difference between a freshly cut , live finger ... and one snipped from a corpse . Less blood in that one you got there . Stiffer , paler . The nail 's yellowed ... no nutrients , deteriorating ' . Want to see what a fresh one looks like ? Check the glove compartment . Told you you 'd see him again . I just did n't say which part of_him . Your boy 's losing a lot ofblood here . Maybe I should take care of that for him . No . No , no . No !

Arlen , we have let you out of every responsibility ... every appearance , every book signing for the last 20 years . All we are asking is that you write a couple of pages on the subject . What is so hard about that ? Try it sometime and find out . I 've been thinking it over and I want to give you my phone number . I have a boyfriend . Not for you . In case you guys are too busy and have to cancel an appointment . That 's the reason . Do you really have a boyfriend ? No . If you did , would you want to go on walks with him ? Yes . Good . Hey , you want to walk around ? Another day , another stroll with a famous author . Must be exhausting . Oh , you have no idea . I hope we 're not breaking some doctor-patient rule
zone3	. No , I only have three rules : Do n't take advice from someone you would n't trade places with ; try not to do something you ca n't take back ; and something is what it is and it 's not something else . I forget my rule , but I think it has something to do with square dancing . Well , this is a street I probably wo n't live on . Oh , you never know . Anything can happen . Yeah . In the meantime , looking 's free . Well , you know what he says . No , I sure do n't .

But I need to be straight with you right now . Shoot . I ca n't accept any more books right now . And it seems you really want to get rid of some books . Oh , you noticed , did you ? I 'm willing to make you a deal . I could use a little advice every now and then , even from someone as obviously crazy as yourself . So here 's what I propose : I 'll let you trade me books for questions . I have a question ... can you guess how much I hate this idea

Thanks . You want to know something cool About shaking hands with little people ? Uh , okay . They see us shaking hands , but they do n't know that we squeeze the other person 's hand . So they just hold hands with you for a couple of seconds . - That is cool . - Yeah yeah , it really is . See you soon . Hey . Why is everybody shaking my hand ?

How can I love him even though he 's selfish and he 's scaring me ? Um , that 's hard . I guess what 's getting in the way are your expectations ... If he would do " x " , then you 'd be happy . It does n't work that way . I think you have to let go of that and maybe what you want will happen and maybe it wo n't . Either way , you 're better off . And you should go to A.A .

So how did you come to be the angel of alignment ? Well , I needed to start over . I needed a change . And I liked the immediacy of it .

Oh , well , he has n't seen his father in over three years . What happened ? Alex 's dad was one of those guys who always has a great new idea , and for a while that was us . And then one day he took Alex to the park and told him that he had to go away for a little while , but he would be back in two weeks ... two weeks . And that turned into three years .

No , this is a nice place and I 'm bringing it down . No , I 'm listening . He 's listening . What do you want to hear ? You want to hear about How I 'm so freaked out that I 'm not doing everything I can ; That I 'm so freaked out all the time ; That I 'm afraid that I 'm not doing enough ; And that that fear is turning me into somebody I do n't want to be and I ca n't stop it ? You have no idea what it 's like to be pulled all the time ... I mean , not by Alex but
zone3	That I am not enough . He knows . And he wants you to know that you are enough and so much more . You are here so God can experience the world through your eyes , see what you see , feel what you feel . Every day he ca n't wait to see what you 'll do , what makes you laugh , what moves you ...

And I kept the models from when I was a kid . And over the years , you know , I 'd pick up another one at a garage sale or a science-fiction expo . I really like them . And I think I 've got a pretty good collection , If you like that sort of thing . Maybe not . It 's not for everybody . It 's dumb , I guess . We should go . No , I love ' em . I think they 're wonderful . - You do ? - Yeah . What are they doing all crammed in here , though ? You should put them out . God knows you have the room . Where are you going ? There , that 's better . But I do n't want it there . I want it
zone3	it out . Consider it an experiment . - Arlen . - Hmm ? Thank you for bringing me here . Oh ... You caught me off-guard tonight . Tell me , am I the first girl to see your monsters ? I 'm sorry . Just give me one second , all right ? Do n't go away . I 'm blowing it again , are n't I ? No , I love it when I 'm about to kiss someone and they leave me to protect a plastic toy . But ... a kiss is so much better knowing they 're safe . I got ta just remember to let that shit go , you know what I mean ? It 's just a car , right ? It 's not life-or-death . Was n't that long ago , if somebody cut me off I 'd go on a three-day binge . And now I just pray silently for their death . ( laughs ) Hi , my name is Ross and I 'm an alcoholic .

And you 're fucked too . - I hear that . - I hear that . - I hear that too . - Right on . Listen , I 've got a great plan . I think what I 'll do is walk around at night tripping the locals , throwing their backs out of alignment . It 's tough work , but the war needs soldiers . Well , that sounds great . When can you start ? Good luck on the moon . We always knew you could do it . Thanks . Gee , you think he 's gon na be safe ? Are you making fun of me ? No , I was just making fun of that
zone3	... I think you could get him to confess . Keeps him safe . - Okay , I 'll see you later . - Yeah , mm-hmm . So what 's the deal with heaven and hell anyway ? I 've seen hell , and it 's name is Reno , Nevada . I ca n't believe God would punish people for not believing in him . Ah , the rapture . What 's that ? Well , I like to think of it as a monster movie . The monster destroys some people and spares others . So who is the monster ? God . God is the monster . Have you been to the chiropractor recently ? " Straighten up " healing center ... We 'll heal you as you straighten . No way . " Straighten up " healing center . Have you been to the chiropractor recently ? What are you doing ?

Yeah , Arlen , get him something to drink . Sure . Kris : I 've never been in here . - The place is huge . - It is . Kris : He 's got nice stuff . ( Elizabethchuckles ) Thanks . So I came home and I found him . He was sitting at the table doing a crossword puzzle . He never does crossword puzzles . Kris just got out of rehab . Oh . Are you okay ? Hey , let 's not talk . Let 's just sit here . That 's a good idea . What did you mean about extra books ? I own a little bookstore ... " Book Trader . " Oh , yeah , that 's where I bought your book . Perfect . Arlen tried to sell me back some books and I could
zone3	now I come to his house and exchange books for questions . You make him pay for his questions with books ? - Totally fair . - No , it 's not . It 's awful . You have n't heard the questions . Arlen , I ca n't feel anything ... Nothing . I should be able to feel something , should n't I ? Do you like working at the bookstore ? I love the bookstore ... All those ideas somebody cared enough about To put all that work into . I could never do anything like that . Sometimes I 'll just stand in the middle of the store at night and imagine that all those authors are surrounding me . I close my eyes and pretend that they 're trying to tell me something . They are . They 're saying , " Give me your money . " What else ? What else do you love about the bookstore ? I love that I feel safe there . Safe from what ? - I do n't know . - Yes , you do . No
zone3	Safe from being scared all the time ... all the time . I get so tired of it . I get so tired of being scared . I get ... My dad died today . I know , baby . I know . I 'm sorry .

We 'll see . - Hey , you want to ... ? - I need to go . Oh . Oh . Why is it that when you 're with me you say the most amazing things , but when some broken-down kid who 's lost his dad needs you ... Nothing . Why is that ? It 's complicated . Really ? I would think something like that is easy for Arlen Faber . Hey , would you just ... ? What ? What is it , Arlen ? What are you hiding ? Time
zone3	showed you my monsters . Are you really Arlen Faber ? No . And neither is Arlen Faber . Anne , it 's me . I 'm calling again . I 'm so sorry . I promised I would n't call again . I know , I know . I just wanted to tell you one more time I 'm so sorry . I 'll never make you wear a costume again . - (
zone3	knocks_on_door ) - Just a minute . I promise , not even for Halloween . So please , if there 's ... So when I figured out it was him , he agreed to help me as long as I did n't tell anybody who he is . Why does n't he want anyone to know who he is ? I do n't know . Maybe it 's because he 's supposed to have all the answers , and he 's a disaster . - ( bonescrack ) - ( exclaims ) Are you his girlfriend or something ? - No . - ( exclaims ) Were you before I told you he wore a
zone3	Do you like him ? Does n't matter . All done . Well , I 'll come by the bookstore this week . Better hurry . Might be going-out-of-business sale time for me . Oh . Yeah , the first one 's free , then they own you . (
zone3	phone_ringing ) Hello . Hi , it 's Elizabeth . Calling to apologize ? No , look , I need to ask you a favor . Well , word on the street is I do n't help anyone . Look , Anne is n't here . I have a client . I 'm stuck . I 'm not hearing a favor in here . I ca n't believe I 'm gon na ask you to do this , but could you please go and pick up Alex from school and bring him to your place and I 'll pick him up later ? And do not talk to anyone . No talking . And I told them you 're my brother . - You what ? - I had to . Just please go and get him and bring him
zone3	him up , bring him back , do not talk . Got it . Hey , buddy . Your mom asked me to come and get you . Okay . Are you here for Alexander ? Yes , Alex . - Oh , you must be the brother . - Correct . Oh , I was expecting to see her today . Today is conference day . She had a medical emergency . So I 'm just gon na take Alex home now . See , I 'm afraid that could affect Alexander getting into the advanced program . Oh , well , you could just tell me . After all , I 'm her brother . Fine . Okay . - This will just take a minute . - Okay . Okay , well , come on in . Shit . Where are my ... ? If you would ... That 's nice . I do n't believe we 've met . I 'm Zebulon . Uncle Zebulon . Ta-dah ! Well , Alexander ... First let me say what a joy he is to have in class .
zone3	with everyone . If one of the other students is hurt or upset , Alexander 's always the first one to show them comfort . He 's quite empathetic . And empathetic is good . - Great . - But in some of the other areas ... Empathy , reading , friendship ... what else is there ? Well , math . He 's far behind the other students . He still struggles with arithmetic while the other students have moved on to multiplication . Well , you 're the teacher . Are n't you supposed to be able to find a way to teach it to him ? I have 26 students . I ca n't devote all of my time to one student . And Alexander still needs to learn our very first lesson . And he 's also ... oh , how do I say this ? Well , immature . He 's seven . Yes , but he still jokes with his seatmates during a lesson and sometimes while we 're trying to have peaceful time . The other students still have to learn all the
zone3	I think if Alexander 's really going to thrive ... Let me stop you right there . I 'm gon na tell you a couple of things . All kids develop in different ways at different times and in different directions . Now I am confident that Alex at some point will be able to tell time and make change , which , let 's face it , just about covers it . I do n't think you 're hearing me . What I am hearing is that Alex is not a good candidate to be a robot in your clone army . Zebulon ... We 're gon na work on the math , okay ? In the meantime , why do n't you try not making him feel like being who he is is the problem ? That 's what happened to you and me , remember ? Oh , and by the way , his name is Alex . He fucking hates " Alexander . " Am I in trouble ? I think we got her right where we want her . She says you 're a great
zone3	she 's talking . - Okay . - Oh , and by the way , If she asks ... I 'm your uncle . My name is Zebulon . Zebulon ... A Hebrew name , means " exalted . " What 's up ? My mom says that meat is poisonous And it can make you sick . And I say if that 's not the best hamburger you have ever had in your life , I 'll change my name to Denise and run into the sea . Okay . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . ( pianoplinking ) This is a nice piano . Yes , it is . - Can you play it ? - A little . Will you play me something ? No , I do n't want to . How come ? Well , it was my father 's and he died and playing it reminds me of him . Was he nice ? Yes , he was . Do you miss him ? Very much . Yes , I do . Me too . - Can I ask you a question ? - Mm-hmm .
zone3	I do n't know either . (
zone3	doorbell_ringing ) Hi . Hi , buddy . Oh , a big hug . Thanks for watching him . It wo n't happen again . No problem , really . - Bye , Arlen . - Bye . Sorry for the imposition . We had a good time . - Elizabeth . - Yeah ? Nothing . Come on , you . Did you have fun ? Hamburgers ? Who thought that was a good idea ? ( playingdidgeridoo ) Kris . - Kris , are you there ? - Go away . What 's up with the bottle ? My dad 's funeral was today . I was the only person that knew . Oh , well , I 'm sure there were some people who could n't make it , you know . No . You said everyone 's life is either moving toward or away from a purpose . Maybe my purpose is to drink . That 's not what I meant . When I came to you , I really thought you could help me . And you know
zone3	all my worst fears are true . I mean , you had the man on the phone , and this is what it did for you . So I may as well go ahead and drink . That 's not what I meant . Congratulations , Arlen . You can have your life back now . Is n't that what you want ? Get out . - Hello . - Hello , Arlen , or should I say Zebulon ? It means " exalted . " do you want ... ? I ca n't believe I forgot about the conference . Lucky for you , I was there . What did you say to her ? Nothing . " Kids develop , " you know , " friendship , reading , " maybe something about robots . Arlen , Mrs . Gold called me and said that she wants to recommend Alex for the advanced program . Oh , well , that 's totally amazing . Thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you . Just when I give up on you ... Yeah , a program
zone3	what ? - I do n't know what you mean . I mean , Mrs . Gold is kind of an uptight little control weasel , And I think that school you love so much is bullshit . I would keep my kid far away from people like that . What that kid needs is confidence . I 'm sorry , when did this go from me thanking you to you attacking me ? I 'm sorry . You 're welcome . I 'm glad you got what you wanted . Are you saying Alex does n't have any confidence ? I 'm saying he 's just a little guy . And all that pressure is gon na fuck him up or turn him into a salesman of some kind . I 'm sorry , when did you become an expert in child raising ? I 'm not the one who straps him into some death harness and then buys pretend food that 's supposed to be better than the real thing . You 're trying to turn him into your idea of who he should be instead of looking
zone3	are you to judge me ? Alex is everything to me and I want to give him the very best . While you 're giving him your best , you might want to tell him his dad 's not coming back . What did you say to him ? What did you say to him ? Nothing . He asked me how long two weeks was . I did n't say anything . Look , he knows the truth , but he needs to hear it from you . Let me guess , God told you that . He said , " They 're having a rough time , Arlen . You should go and help them . " No ? Of course not . Because you do n't want to help anybody . You do n't want to know anybody . You just want to sit in here and hide and watch while the rest of us try to work it out . It must be hilarious . It 's not like that . You know , I feel more alone now than I did before we met .
zone3	Excuse me . Hi . You must be Kris . I 'm Terry ... Terry Fraser , Arlen 's agent . How did you do it ? Wait , I do n't want to know . I do n't care . ( laughs ) - What 's going on ? - You do n't know ? Arlen is coming here to speak for the 20th-anniversary of " Me and God . " It 's a miracle . He phoned me and told me to get the books over here , said he 's already sent word to all of the websites ... all of them . Get over here . What 's going on ? ThatTerry lady came in this morningg with all these boxes of books And said that your pal Arlen is speaking here today and we 'd better get busy . We do n't have any money to buy books . Kris , it was a gift . - Where is he ? - He 's coming . No , Kris . Who 's gon na help me ... ? Hi , you guys . Anne :
zone3	you go . Just fill that out . We 'll get to all of you , I promise . - What are you doing right now ? - We 're kind of busy . Arlen 's going to speak at the bookstore . - Woman : Arlen who ? - Arlen Faber . There he is . - Man : I love your book , Arlen . - Woman : You rock , Arlen . Terry : ladies and gentlemen , this is a very special occasion for all of us , something that we have waited for for 20 years . The author of " Me and God , " the man who showed us a glimpse of heaven ... Arlen Faber . Thank you , Terry . You were right . I should have done this a long time ago . Thank you for coming . I would also like to thank Kris Lucas and " Book Trader " for allowing me to use their store today . This is the best bookstore in Philadelphia . Whoo ! Now those of you who liked the book , one
zone3	be useful to people ... one ... Terry Fraser . Terry is the one person who saw the value there . All right , now I came here to tell you something , so just hold your applause until the end , all right ? Now I know many of you have questions . ( allclamoring ) I ca n't talk to God . Here 's the deal ... A little over 20 years ago I found out that my father had an illness . Everything he had and everything that we did together would be taken from him one memory at a time . Now I got this news and I begged for help from , you know , whomever . I pleaded ... Nothing . I had questions . I wanted answers , needed them . You know what it 's like . Well , guess what happened . I did n't get them . And it really pissed me off . So one day I started to write the questions down . And then some answers to those questions came to me and I wrote them down
zone3	these pages . One thing led to another And that 's how " Me and God " came to be . That 's it . I did n't even really think that much of it at the time . I wish it were more amazing than that , I really do . Are you saying you made it all up ? I do n't know . Maybe . Maybe whoever 's up there just used my anger and pain to make me part of some divine plan . And if he did , he sure as hell did n't let me in on it . I 'm not a guy with answers . I 'm just a guy who recently crawled back to civilization on all fours . Hang on , so all those questions ... (
zone3	door_opens_and_closes ) The best advice I had at the time , and I meant every word . I 'm sorry , I have to go now . So you 're just like the rest of us . Not yet , but I 'm trying . Oh , God . Stop following me .
zone3	This is dumb . You 're right . This is dumb . Look , you 're complicated and confusing . Alex and I do n't need that - in our lives right now . - Yes , you do . - No . - Listen , you can leave ... No , you 'll just make something up . And I know ... Shut up , Elizabeth . Look , everything I said was true , okay ? It just did n't come from some invisible super being . It came from me ... me . What do you want me to say , " It 's okay that you lied " ? You want me to fall in your arms and say , " All is forgiven " ? I understand , all right ? You were protecting yourself and you freaked out . Happens to the best of us . Let 's just leave it at that . That 's not good enough . Yes , I lied . Yes , I 'm sorry . Yes , I led you on . Yes to all of it .
zone3	questions I ever had is a kid like Alex who 's got a mom like you . If we could maybe just start again , I think this might end better . Maybe it would . Elizabeth . I 'm Arlen .

We are looking for a friend . - Shanti . - Shanti ? What kind of name is that ? Hindu ? This is the address he gave us . I do not know who he is , but ... " Mi casa es tu casa " .

Mark was always my whore ... Really ? This means that it was he who was underneath you at school . I do not know what you mean ... I 've heard that you climbed . What exactly mean each bitch was one another . This is according to the terminology used by prostitutes because if I 'm a bitch Mark , this implies a position , so I 'm sure What happened otherwise with you . Well , I do not know what you heard , but this makes no sense ... He 's my bitch ! What do you say now ? Fuck this Shanti . Go to the street , why not has cell phone signal here .

I saw that we were on the side wrong park . We took the wrong bus . All were furious . 3:00 : Golden Gate Park Said that we should across the park ? Are you afraid ? The monsters make me dizzy . Come on ! Mom said not to go the park at night . Jasper is weird . Yes , and I 'm thinking is
zone3	with me . What is it ? - Promise ? No , I promise . I forgot ... - Speaks ! I always forget when a subject is delicate . What ? We were talking and playing on what it means to be someone 's bitch , and in a way I said that if it was not your bitch , you must have been in his college and not otherwise . - Jeez ! - Sorry .

zone3	3737502 RODRICK : ( WHISPERING ) Greg ? GREG : ( GROGGILY ) Mmm . ( INSINGSONG ) Greg ? What ? Greg ! Huh ? What ? What are you doing ? Get up ! Mom and Dad have been calling you for an hour . You 're about to be late for your first day of middle school . What ? Oh , geez ! How did that happen ? Go , go , go ! Mom 's about to flip out ! She sent me to get you while she waits in the car ! ( exclaims ) What are you doing ? What 's going on ? Getting ready for ... ( HOOTlNG ) ... school . Are you insane ? School does n't start till next week . And , fyi , school does n't start at 4:00 in the morning ! You woke up Manny . And if he does n't go back down ... Good morning ! There is no way he is going back down . I just wanted to sleep till 6:00 . Bubby ! FRANK : Go to bed . I got him . Greg , what are you doing
zone3	He woke me up ! He changed my clock ! ( SNORlNG ) But I swear , he was just ... Go to bed . What is that smell ? I ca n't even identify it . Bubby ! ( GRUNTS ) ( giggling ) kids : Happy Birthday ! Here , Bubby . GREG : Wow ! Look at the size of that flamethrower ! Okay , first of all , let me get something straight . This is a journal , not a diary . Yeah , I know what it says on the cover . But when my mom went out to buy this thing , I specifically told her not to buy one that said " diary " on it . This just proves Mom does n't understand anything about kids my age . Huh ? Sissy ! The only reason I agreed to write in this thing is because when I 'm rich and famous I 'll have better things to do than answer people 's stupid questions all day long . Gregory , tell us about your childhood ! Were you always so smart
zone3	shoo , shoo . SUSAN : That 's our boy up there . Why did I ever say no to him ? Mom got me this thing so I could write down my feelings about starting middle school . But I 'm gon na be fine . It 's my best friend , Rowley Jefferson , I 'm worried about . He 's definitely not middle school ready . Geronimo ! ( WHOOPS ) He 's not quite clear on the concept of growing up . I want a puppy , a kitty , a gumball machine ... But anyway , this is about me , not Rowley . I always figured they 'd make a movie about my life . But I did n't think they 'd start the story here . Because , seriously , who wants to see a movie about a kid who 's stuck in middle school with a bunch of morons ? ( ALARMbuzzing ) ( GROANS ) ( RODRlCKEXCLAlMlNG ) Three days , no shower . Smell the love ! Let me go , Rodrick ! ( GROANS ) Come on . We
zone3	okay . So , look . Mom asked me to give you some advice about middle school . It 's real simple . Do n't talk to anyone . Do n't look at anyone . Do n't go anywhere . Do n't sit down . Do n't raise your hand . Do n't go to the bathroom . Do n't get noticed . Do n't choose the wrong locker . Do n't ... Who am I kidding ? You 'll be dead or homeschooled by the end of the year , anyway . And do n't be seen with Rowley . ( EXCLAlMlNG ) Manny , stop it ! Mom ! RODRlCK : Thanks for the eggs , Mom . Frank ? Greg ? I think it 's gross and undignified that I have to eat breakfast next to him on the potty . Okay , well , it 's your fault he 's still potty training . Do n't look down , Manny . The potty monster does n't like it when you look at him . ( SCREAMS ) I was just joking with him . Okay .
zone3	a move on . Ca n't be late for your first day of school . (
zone3	school_bell_ringing ) GREG : Let me just say for the record that I think middle school may be the dumbest idea ever invented . You got kids like me who have n't hit their growth spurt yet mixed in with gorillas who have to shave twice a day . There 's juvenile delinquents and weirdos . I 'm smaller than about 95% of the kids at my school ... CHlRAG : Give it back ! Stop ! ... so thank God for Chirag Gupta . It 's mine ! Stop ! Can I have the backpack ? You got to jump higher . It 's not yours ! He 's an excellent buffer between me and these morons . Hey , Greg . Hey , fella ! seriously , I do n't know what happened to these kids over the summer . Was there a nuclear accident ? Science experiment gone bad ? Thank God there are a few normal people or this place would be a total freak show . If you 're
zone3	to figure out where to sit on your first day of middle school . One bad move and you 're stuck next to some idiot for the rest of the year . ( SNlFFLlNG ) ROWLEY : Greg ! Remember how I said Rowley was n't middle school ready ? Well , there you go . (
zone3	speaking_spanish ) What are you wearing ? My family just got back from Guatemala ! It 's my serape ! Nice , huh ? All right , class , I 'm Mrs . Flint . Everybody take your seats ! ( GROANS ) Welcome to your first day of middle school . Remember your seats . You 'll be sitting here every day . Rowley , if you had to say where you were ranked in terms of popularity from one to 200 , where would you put yourself ? is 200 good or bad ? I 'd say you 're somewhere around the 1 54 mark . I 'd put myself around number 1 9 or 20 . I might even have a shot at the top spot by the end of
zone3	they will . Well , who 's at the bottom ? Hey , guys , wan na see my secret freckle ? ( BOTHGROAN ) GREG : Fregley . Sent home for hygiene issues at Ieast once a month . Check it out . It 's got a hair in it ! What color is that ? You wan na help me name it ? All right , ladies ! Gather around ! Come on , put the knitting down ! Let 's go ! All right , everybody . I 'm Coach Malone and I am your gym teacher . P . E . is as much a part of my life as waking up in the morning and going to the bathroom . I live and breathe Physical Education . Now , who 's with me ? Are you ready to have some fun out there ? Yeah ! MALONE : All right , outstanding ! So we 're gon na divide you up into two teams . So you two , over here . You , you , you , this way . Yeah , you three
zone3	to be Shirts ! And you will be Skins . Why are we Skins ? I hate this . He 's just trying to make kids like us feel bad . What do you mean , kids like us ? I just do n't want to get a sunburn , right , Rowley ? ( lNroboticvoice ) My name is Bell E . Button . What 's yours ? Okay , let 's start off with a little game I like to call Gladiator . ( BOYSEXCLAlMlNG ) BOY 1 : I got this one ! BOY 2 : No ! BOY 3 : Take that ! ( GRUNTS ) ( NEVERmissABEATPLAYING ) Cover me ! Oh , God . Not good ! We 're never going to be able to outrun these guys ! We do n't have to outrun them ! We just have to outrun Chirag ! Take a look , take a look , take a look At the kids on the street No , they never miss a beat Never miss a beat Think they saw us ? No way . They were focused on
zone3	here for the rest of the class because I 'm not playing that game . It 's not fair . He 's got all the Neanderthals on the same team . It 's barbaric ! angle : It 's completely barbaric . This place is an intellectual wasteland . But , you know , it 's nice to meet someone more interested in his mind than in his body . You girls get to jump rope . What are you doing hiding ? Avoiding the pain . It all starts in middle school , you know ? You 're not a kid anymore . The coddling has stopped . Kids are now separated by intelligence . The weak are picked on . And girls you 've known since kindergarten wo n't even talk to you anymore . Okay , well , sounds like you got it all figured out , so go back to your book . This place is a glorified holding pen . MALONE : All the way ! All the way ! You 're like a machine ! angle : It 's where adults put you as
zone3	they do n't even have to look at you . Hi . I 'm Angie . Great story . We 're gon na go now . Why ? This is a good spot . It 's a perfect spot . I survived all of the sixth grade here . And I would enjoy some like-minded company to get me through the seventh . is that the whistle ? I think I hear the whistle . We need to go . MALONE : No showboating , all right ? Why are we leaving ? We could get killed out here in the open ! Put your shirt on . They 'll think we 're on their team . Besides , getting crushed is better than being seen with that freak job . Trust me , you ca n't recover from social suicide . I never talked to a girl that long before . Whoa ! Check that out . is that cheese ? Stop ! Good God , man ! You almost got the Cheese Touch . The what ? The Cheese Touch . Nobody knows when or how , but
zone3	Nobody knew who it belonged to . Nobody touched it . Nobody threw it away . And so there it sat , growing more foul and powerful by the day . Then one day , a kid named Darren WaIsh made the biggest mistake of his life . Darren touched the cheese ! No , I did n't ! I just looked at it ! Really ! CHlRAG : Darren had the Cheese Touch ! It was worse than nuclear cooties . He became an outcast . ( crying ) The only way to get rid of the Cheese Touch was by passing it on to someone else . ( SCREAMS ) And so began the Cheese Touch Frenzy . Friend turning on friend . Brother turning on sister . It was madness . Until a German exchange student named Dieter Muller took it away . Dieter has the Cheese Touch ! Ze Cheese Touch ? Vat is it ? Vat does it mean , ze Cheese Touch ? Sadly for Dieter , that fact was lost in translation . Nooooooooo ... ... ! Thankfully , he moved back to
zone3	. And so the cheese sits , patiently waiting for its next victim . Wow . Wow . This is a terrible place . No doors ? None . I 'm not pooping until I 'm in high school . GREG : The cafeteria , possibly the cruelest place on Earth . But I was about to make some kid 's day by sitting next to him . That seat 's saved . For who ? It 's saved . That one 's saved , too . So not happening . Uh-uh-uh . Taken . Where are we supposed to eat ? I guess this is where all the cool guys hang out . ( SNEEZES ) Fregley must have bumped his head when he was little , like , really hard . ( BURPS ) Okay , okay , so my first day could have gone better , but at Ieast I was n't humiliated . Hey , Greg ! You want to come over and play ? ( kidslaughing ) What did he just say to you ? Oh . I think my ride 's here . Hey
zone3	, " You wan na come over and play ? " Yeah ! Do you guys wan na play with us ? ( BOYSlaughing ) See ? This is the problem . Right now I have to take abuse from these morons . But in 20 years , Quentin here will be working for me . Greg , please do n't fire me . I really need my measly , pathetic job scooping your dog 's poop . Whatever . I 'll think about it . No , no , no . Vanilla on the bottom and chocolate on the top ! I ca n't eat this ! " Play , " Rowley ? " Play " ? I 've told you , like , a billion times that guys our age say " hang out , " not " play . " Oops . Seriously , if you 're not gon na listen to me , just tell me , ' cause if you pull another stunt like that , we 'll be stuck on the cafeteria floor for the rest of middle school . I found half a
zone3	guy who eats off his lap in the cafeteria . I should be at the top of the food chain by now . Something 's got to change , fast . My mom told me to just be myself and people would like me . That would be good advice if you were somebody else . ( LOUDROCKmusicplaying ) Hey , little brother . Was your first day as crappy as I said it would be ? No . Not at all . You were wrong . It was actually better than I ... Worse . ( CHUCKLES ) You did n't listen to me , did you ? I told you not to talk , look or go anywhere , and what happened ? He had to eat his lunch on the floor . Rowley . ( laughing ) Perfect . And if nobody wants you sitting at their table , you think they want Chummy Buttons over here ? I was right . You 're not even gon na make it out of there alive . The only chance you have of making the yearbook is when they
zone3	play Twisted Wizard ? No . I have a better idea . If he catches you in here , he will kill you . Literally , kill you . Do n't worry . As long as we hear the music , we 're okay . ( LOUDmusicplaying ) Whoa . Yeah . Wow . I did n't know Rodrick was into motorcycles . I found it . Found what ? Rodrick 's middle school yearbook . This thing holds all the answers . Rowley , this thing is like a bible . See this ? This is where a person like me needs to be . The class favorites . They 're the best in their class . These people are n't nobodies . They 're famous . They do n't have to worry about getting a seat in the cafeteria , either . Check this out . There 's tons of things I qualify for . " Most Likely To Succeed , " " Best Looking , " " Class Clown . " They should just give that to me right now . Do n't you have to be
zone3	cutest friends ! What did I tell you would happen if you ever went in my room again ? But your band is still playing . It 's the bass solo , Turd Burglar ! Do n't you know anything about music ? Now , I came up here to get a new drumstick , and now , Greg , since Mom and Dad are gone , I 'm going to kill you . Literally , kill you ! I told you . Beat it . Okay , but I just want to say one thing ! Run , Greg , run ! What ? Let go , Baby Hippo ! ( laughing ) You 're gon na have to come out sometime , loser ! I 'll wait here as long as it takes . And then , you 're dead . Time out , Rodrick . I have to pee . ( CHUCKLES ) No time outs . Only death ! But I really have to go . Do n't care . ( WATERgurgling ) ( GURGLlNG ) ( exclaims ) ( sighs ) ( humming ) Move
zone3	you ! ( screaming ) Greg , did you throw Manny off his ... What is going on ? Greg started it . I just came in here to take a shower . He 's lying ! He was gon na kill me ' cause I was in his room ! And so you peed on him ? Yes . I mean , no . I mean ... Yes . ( whistling ) ( ALLchattering ) (
zone3	school_bell_rings ) Wow , there 's a lot to sign up for . You could be class favorite in a bunch of things . Jazz dancing ! We could do that one together ! I ca n't believe all these activities . They 're all so much work . Staying after school , meeting before school , on weekends . What kind of extracurricular activities are these ? Out of my way . Who let you into this school , Greg Heffley ? I was thinking the same thing about you , Patty Farrell . You listen to me , Greg Heffley . I 'm running for student council president and I 'm
zone3	I will beat you up , just like I did in kindergarten and fourth grade . Fourth grade ? That one was ugly . What 's her problem ? What did I ever do to her ? Patty , Patty is a fatty , has a face just like a ratty ! ( crying ) (
zone3	all_laughing ) Come on , that was pretty funny . She needs to get a sense of humor . And I need something to make me a class favorite . angle : What about class favorites ? Do n't you ever say hi or hello before you start talking ? Hi . Hello . Oh , Greg 's only here because he really wants to be something ... Rowley ! I was just saying that I would really like to nail these people because it 's so obvious that they 're only doing these activities to get in the yearbook . You know , I like your point of view . You should sign up for the school paper . We 're the voice of the people . Well , the people are mostly
zone3	're the voice of the people making fun of the people . Thanks , but I ca n't be on the paper because I 'm gon na be in the paper a lot . So that would be a conflict of interest . You 're the people . Got it . Do you believe me now ? That girl is crazy town . Look ! They have wrestling ! That 's it ! I 'm great at wrestling . I 've watched it for years , I know all the moves . Tombstone piledriver . Chair shot . Vader Bomb . audience : Heffley ! Heffley ! Heffley ! Heffley ! Heffley ! Heffley ! Heffley ! Okay . Something is very wrong here . These do n't look like wrestling costumes to me . Welcome to wrestling , you future Olympians ! So , just to make sure we all get off on the right foot and nobody gets seriously injured , we 're gon na teach you a few basic moves . Remember , this is about learning the sport and having fun ! All right . lt
zone3	superstar to me . Coach Brewer , can you step over here for a moment , please , give me a hand ? Thanks . ( GRUNTS ) ( ALLexclaim ) That 's known as a speed takedown . Nice job , Coach Brewer . Can you get up and come behind me ? Put one arm over my shoulder ? Let 's go , yeah . You got it , walk it off , come on . That was known as the arm drag . Let 's give Coach Brewer a hand , everybody ! He 's fine . Yeah , Heffley . What about piledrivers and Vader bombs ? That is fake wrestling . This is real wrestling ! Let 's go ! If I have to wrestle Benny Wells , he 'll kill me ! MALONE : Let 's move ! Come on ! Okay , to keep things fair , I 've divided you into weight categories by your size , so Rottweilers over here . Bulldogs , you stay right there . And we got two Chihuahuas . Yeah . Nice head gear . Thanks
zone3	, let 's see what you got . (
zone3	whistle_blows ) Do n't worry , Fregley , I 'll take it easy on you . ( EXCLAlMlNG ) Hey , I was n't ready ! Nobody 's keeping score , but that was a sweet speed takedown , Fregley ! This is fun , Greg Heffley ! Get off me ! ALL : ( chanting ) Fregley ! Fregley ! Fregley ! Blow the whistle , blow the whistle ! All right ! Fregley ! Outstanding ! And let 's ... Let 's hear it for our other winner . Yay , Greg ! I ca n't lose to Fregley again . If I get beat by the weirdest kid in school , nobody 's ever gon na let me sit at their table . How are you going to beat him ? It 's like he had superhuman strength ! I 'm not gon na beat him . I 'm gon na gain 1 0 pounds this week so I can move up to the Bulldog weight class . And then you and I can wrestle each other .
zone3	. You 're better at riding than I am , and I 'm a better thrower . ( sighs ) Greg , save some for everybody else , honey . GREG : Ca n't . I need to bulk up . Why ? I think your body looks beautiful just the way it is . I heard he got his butt kicked at wrestling . Now what is wrong with you ? Why would you sign up for something you do n't have to do ? You signed up for wrestling ? Kind of . You never sign up for anything at school . You fly below the radar . That way you never raise anyone 's expectations . Thank you , Rodrick , for those words of motivational wisdom , but perhaps a better way to look at it is that it 's a chance to learn to excel at something . Well , what could I learn at school that I ca n't teach myself ? Well , Greg , I think it 's great that you took the initiative to learn something new . This is like
zone3	Will was smaller than you , but he built himself up with the weights ! Yeah . We could get you the same equipment . You could train , get the right nutrition , cardio . You 'd be in tip-top shape just like Will . And it would only take , like , three months . Three months ? Yeah . I 'll just stick to eating . Well , I do n't know where you put it , Heffley , but you gained 1 0 pounds and joined the Bulldog class . Yes . I thought you did n't gain any weight this week . My mom 's ankle weights . All right , bulldog Heffley . Meet your new opponent . What ? But this is boys ' wrestling . Ever hear of Title lX ? Her parents threatened to sue , so you show her what it 's like to wrestle a real live boy . ( GRUNTS ) Come on ! What you waiting for , huh ? Do n't be such a wuss , Heffley . Make your move ! She 's a girl
zone3	Patty , over here ! Get off of me ! Can I wrestle somebody good now ? (
zone3	all_laughing ) Well , look who 's in the paper . Greg ! You 're famous ! Right on the front page ! And if I would have pinned her , which I could have done easily , you know I would have gotten in trouble for hurting a girl . Why does she even want to wrestle ? Who knows ? Girls are very confusing . Like today , I heard someone in the hallway say that Bryce Anderson has a cute butt . What does that even mean ? A butt ca n't be cute . It 's a butt . I know , but that 's what they were saying . I do n't see why girls our age ca n't talk just like regular people . So how are you gon na become a class favorite now ? Two words . Best Dressed . How are you going to do that ? Fashion is easy . You wear a shirt and a tie , and kids are impressed
zone3	work . ( singing ) I light ' em up before the motor starts I go so fast that I could never stop Look under the hood but you do n't know what I got I 'm a moving violation , baby Hot , hot , hot , hot Ta-da ! I told you I was wearing this . I know ! I wanted to be matchers ! BOY : Check them out ! ALL : ( singing ) Greg and RowIey sitting in a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G First comes love ... GREG : You know , maybe Rodrick was right about Rowley . Maybe I do need a new best friend . But I ca n't just ditch him . I mean , if anybody has a better idea , I 'd love to hear it . NARRATOR : In this school , much like your own , one boy is about to learn an important lesson about seIf-worth and esteem . Gag me with a spoon . That guy is so unpopular , I 'd hate to be him . ( sighs ) Why does n't anybody like me
zone3	awesome you really are . Brock Branigan P.l . ! What are you doing here ? I 'm here to solve the case of the boy who just needed to be himself . So go for it ! Show them how awesome you really are ! Hey , guys . Do you like break dancing ? ( UPBEATmusicplaying ) That is totally rad ! Wicked . You should sit with us at lunch , friend . Sweet ! It really is awesome to be me ! Thanks , Brock . Okay . Let 's talk about what we 've learned . GREG : I do n't know about anyone else , but I know what I Iearned . It is awesome to be me . The problem with Rowley is that he 's not enough like me . I ca n't ditch him ' cause he 'd be lost without me . But maybe I can fix him . Because that 's the kind of friend I am . What are you doing ? Making your clothes more middle-school friendly . Look at this stuff . Too babyish and weird
zone3	now ? " What are you , a foreign exchange student ? Oh , man . This one we burn . That was a present from my mom . Well , then your mom is trying to get you killed . Ready ? Steady . Go . No , no , no . You look like one of the Seven Dwarfs . You only need one strap . One strap is cool . But there 's two straps . Why would they put on two straps if you 're only supposed to use one ? Because the guys who make backpacks are n't cool . If they were cool , they 'd give it one strap , like the cool one-strap guys do . You know what has one strap ? Machine guns . You know what else ? Electric guitars . You know what else ? Purses ? But Joshie is cool . Rowley , Joshie is not cool . He 's a lip-synching pop star whose fans are eight-year-old girls . You 're just jealous that I was the one who discovered him . Who are you gon
zone3	Joshie says to respect your parents and follow your dreams . Then Joshie must get beaten up a lot . You actually almost look as good as me . Am I great at this or what ? There 's Bryce Anderson . Just be cool . Hey , Bryce . Yeah , hey , Bryce ! Cute butt ! You 're killing me , you know that ? Look , Rowley , tonight 's Halloween , our favorite night of the year , so , just promise me you wo n't wear , do or say anything weird . (
zone3	doorbell_rings ) You 're kidding me , right ? ( sighs ) My mom wanted me to be visible at night . From space ? So , we 'll hit a few houses on the way to the North Side , which is where we 'll do most of our trick-or-treating . Why are we going all the way over there ? It 's where the rich people live . They hand out , like , two , three pieces of big candy to each kid . Not that candy
zone3	and Nutter Butters . Plus , if we time it right , rich people get tired of answering their doors and just leave the bowl out . We can clean up . ROWLEY : Wow , you 're lucky . My mom does n't let me play with makeup anymore . Shut up , tool . L ? ded Diper 's got a gig tonight . Mmm . Going to the North Side , huh ? Takes you right past the Devil Worshiper Woods . The Devil Worshiper Woods ? You know about that story , right ? Well , there used to be this house right here where these woods are . They had to tear it down because what happened there was so terrible . What happened there ? Well , a long time ago , two kids who were , I do n't know , maybe in middle school , they trick-or-treated at that house on Halloween night . But the house was full of devil worshipers who put the kids in these giant pizza ovens . And they cooked them and they ate them . But
zone3	house burned down with everyone in it . How 'd the trees get there ? And then they planted trees . Oh . And to this day , on Halloween night , you can still hear the demonic laughter of the devil worshiper ghosts as they roam the woods , looking for more kids to sacrifice ! Hey , Rodrick . I need you to help me out . Like ... (
zone3	doorbell_rings ) Are you wearing eyeliner ? kids : Trick or treat . Susan ! I 'm on door duty ! girl : Thank you . Bubby ! Mom , can you tell him to stop calling me that ? What if somebody hears ? Then they 'll know how much he loves you . Frank , Frank , honey , honey , can you go with them ? No , I ca n't . I got to guard the house in case someone tries to T . P . us . They 're gon na get drenched from the roof . ( LAUGHS ) Honey , for goodness sakes , do n't do that again . Remember
zone3	crying ) Hi . I thought they were teenagers . And I could n't see through the bushes . My legs , they hurt from the squatting . So , that 's why I 'm doing it from the roof this year . So I can see when they 're coming . Can we go now ? (
zone3	doorbell_rings ) Yes , go . But stay in the neighborhood . kids : Trick or treat . And no North Side ! We promise ! GREG : We got to stay in this neighborhood the rest of the night . That guy gave me two full-size Snickers ! Did I tell you or did I tell you ? These people have money to burn ! ( **30;1302;TOOLONG ) ROWLEY : I ca n't believe we got this much candy . This is , like , the best day ever . CARTER : Hey , reflector dude , nice costume ! Thanks ! My mom made it ... ( EXCLAlMlNG ) ( BOYSlaughing ) CARTER : Oh , that was awesome ! I saw your plates ! We 're calling the cops
zone3	: Hey , they 're going through the yard ! Go , go , go , go , go , go , go ! Where are we going ? We 're totally exposed ! My grandma 's house ! Quickly ! They 're coming ! ( ringingDOORBELL ) Hello ? That 's not helping ! She 's not home ! Bingo night . CARTER : Okay , you guys are dead . ROWLEY : Open the door ! Get the key ! GREG : Okay . Okay . ROWLEY : Open the door ! Get it ! Come on , let 's get them , boys . ROWLEY : They 're coming ! ROWLEY : Now ! CARTER : Oh , I got you now ! PETE : Hey , hey ! Come on , you babies ! I 'm gon na kick your butts ! Yeah ? You and what army ? Whatever . ( BOTHbabbling ) You guys are so lucky you can hide in there behind your mommy ! No , we are n't ! It 's not our house ! It 's his grandma 's and
zone3	? Why would you tell them that ? CARTER : ( SOFTLY ) Did he just say that ? Oops . Now they 're never gon na leave . You need to call your mom to come get us . Mine 'll kill me if she knows we 're here . Mine will , too . She thinks you 're a bad influence . She 's right . Then we 're gon na have to bust out of here . PETE : You have any threes ? Go fish . ( CREAKlNG ) Hey , what 's that ? ( DANGER ! high VOLTAGE PLAYING ) Danger , danger High Voltage ( laughing ) Danger , danger High Voltage Just back off ! I do n't want to hurt anybody , we just want to walk away and forget this ever happened . Nobody needs to be a hero ! Whoa ! Are you kidding me ? I 'm gon na rip off your arms and punch you in the face with your own fists ! They 're gaining ! This way ! The Devil Worshiper Woods ! No way
zone3	're gon na get you ! ( panting ) They 're going into the woods . ( panting ) No , no way I go into Devil Worshiper Woods . Uh-uh . This is n't over ! ROWLEY : I 'm really scared ! Just keep running ! ( ROWLEYpanting ) ( LOUDLAUGHTER ) ROWLEY : Did you hear that ? It 's the devil worshipers . ( LOUDLAUGHTER ) ( LAUGHTERcontinues ) (
zone3	both_screaming ) Guys ? Are we safe ? Yeah . And we made it with still a ton of candy . Sorry . I was ... I thought you were teenagers . BOY : Maybe next year , Pops ! Hey ! ( sniffing ) ( GROANS ) So anyone else exhibiting symptoms of pink eye should contact the nurse immediately . In field trip news , consent forms are going out today for our annual History of Plumbing excursion . In sports news ... I think Shelly is looking hot today . BOY : Yeah . Are they talking about me ? I do n't know . I do n't speak Russian . ( TEACHERSHUSHlNG
zone3	the Safety patrol . If anyone is interested , see Mr . Winsky after homeroom . GREG : Now that 's what I 'm talking about . Safety patrol . The cops of middle school . You boss people around , report the jerks , and miss class three times a week . MR . WlNSKY : Safety Patrol is a sacred trust . When you put on this vest and that badge you become a protector of the weak . You become an enforcer of the laws of this school , because today 's litterer and jaywalker is tomorrow 's window breaker and graffiti vandal , and it 's our job to stop it . So I ask you , are you up for the job ? Yes ! Yes ! Then welcome to Safety Patrol . Just remember , with great power ... Whoa . Now , you get your first assignment just after lunch , so you 'll be excused from the first 20 minutes of sixth period . But that means we 'll miss Algebra ... Ouch ! Do we get free stuff ? Free hot
zone3	, is that cocoa ? Sorry , Safety Patrol only . Sorry . You rejected the school paper , but you joined the Safety Patrol ? Look , are you working your way down the evolutionary ladder ? What ? Look , Safety Patrol is the lowest of the low , the geekiest of the geeky , the island of Misfit Toys . You 're just jealous they do n't trust you to keep our school safe . Now if you 'll excuse me , I need to secure the perimeter . girl : I 'm hungry . GREG : Keep it straight , people . Single-file line , one by one . ( **26;1334;TOOLONG ) Greg ! It 's those guys from Halloween ! What do we do ? Come on , man , just pull my finger . I swear to God , I 'm not gon na do anything . Everybody , shoulder to shoulder . Shoulder to shoulder . GREG : Go . Go ! Whoa , whoa . That was close . Too close . (
zone3	both_laughing ) GREG : It 's times like these
zone3	me as a friend . ROWLEY : And I got Twisted Wizard Two , and a new bike ! And we 're going to take a family trip to New York City for New Year 's Eve ! What did you get ? My dad got me a weight-lifting set . Do you know how many video games l could 've gotten instead ? I had to get out of there before he expected me to , like , use it . Anyway , let 's play some Twisted Wizard Two at your house . Probably not a good idea . My dad 's still annoyed at you . For what ? Remember that secret language we made up last week ? Your-pa dad-pa smells-pa like-pa a woman-pa . (
zone3	both_laughing ) I think he cracked our code . We should probably do something outside . Why ca n't you ride and I throw at you first ? My legs kind of hurt from walking over here . ( sighs ) ( screaming ) ( GRUNTS ) Okay , Rowley . Come on . Get up . ( ROWLEYgroaning )
zone3	right ? It really did n't look that broken to me . Yeah , it 's broken . The X-ray never lies . Oh , my gosh . What happened ? I broke it . SHELLY : How ? Big Wheel accident . You 're funny . Can I sign your cast ? Me , too . I wan na sign it , too . Why , sure . Hey , I 'm the one who broke his hand . Then you 're a jerk . ( whispers ) Sorry . girl : Does it hurt ? ( exclaims ) SHELLY : Rowley , you 're so funny . After I stood ... GREG : I could n't believe it ! Rowley was eating at an actual table because of something I did ! Where 's my credit ? And he 's right handed ! He can feed himself just fine . So , how 's that class favorite thing working out for you ? Great . ( whooping ) I realized Rowley 's injury thing was a pretty good racket . (
zone3	school_bell_ringing ) MARLEY : It 's gon
zone3	Check it out . Oh , my gosh , what happened ? It 's a raging infection caused by a splinter that was left untreated . Want to be the first to sign my sympathy sheet ? No . I 'll sign it , Greg Heffley , if you 'd let me look at your infection . ROWLEY : And on the X-ray , you could see where the bone just snapped right in half . I had the exact same break last year , and it got all purple ! ROWLEY : Cool ! Mine , too ! Hey , Gregory , want to sign the card ? You got Rowley a card ? What ? No , it 's for Bryan Little . You know , the guy who writes the Wacky Dawg cartoons for the school paper ? He has mono and he 's going to be out for three months . That really stinks . So , just out of curiosity , who 's gon na do the cartoon ? They 're having tryouts , but the important thing is Bryan gets better . Absolutely .
zone3	draw cartoons all the time . I 'm gon na win this . I decided to go ahead and forgive Rowley for milking the broken hand so hard and I told him he could work on the cartoon with me . So , I was thinking we could do something like this ! Oops , I stepped in a puddle ! At least it 's not an acid puddle . Oy , oy , oy ! It is an acid puddle ! Zoo-wee Mama ! It 's the same joke every time . Yeah ! Zoo-wee Mama ! We ca n't just do the same thing over and over . We can if it 's Zoo-wee Mama . It has to be a little more sophisticated . GREG : ( lMlTATESCRElGHTON ) I wonder what is in this cute little box . GREG : ( **25;1362;TOOLONG ) It 's not a box , it 's a brick , you dumb moron . GREG : ( lMlTATESCRElGHTON ) Oops ! I 've been trying to open it all day ! Can he say , " Zoo-wee Mama " ? No ,
zone3	is . I like Zoo-wee Mama . You know what ? If you like it so much , then why do n't you go do it yourself ? Okay . I will . See you . (
zone3	school_bell_ringing ) Hey , I forgot my raincoat , so I 'm gon na need you to walk the kids home today . I ca n't . I ca n't get my cast wet . You can borrow my coat . girl : Where 's Rowley ? He could n't get his cast wet ! He walks us better ! Oh , no . Oh , my gosh ! Space monsters ! They 're going to eat us , unless we can get into that hole ! Come on , people , move it ! Now , people ! We 're gon na get eaten ! Come on ! Do n't worry ! I 'm right behind you ! Whoa ! Go ! Hey ! Rowley Jefferson , is that you ? Yes , Mrs . Irvine ! Sorry , kids ! Are you going to eat us ? And though doctors assure
zone3	the cafeteria nachos bar will be closed for the remainder of the week . And now , what you 've all been waiting for . The faculty , Student council and editors have all met and selected the new cartoonist for the school paper . And the winner is " Zoo-wee Mama " by Rowley Jefferson ! (
zone3	all_cheering ) What ? That is funny ! BOY : Great job . Zoo-wee Mama . GREG : I could n't believe it . Am I the only one who gets comedy ? Rowley , will you put me in your cartoon ? Sure . And me , too . I want to be the one who says , " Zoo-wee Mama . " You got it ! Hey , Rowley , congratulations . Thanks . No problem . You know , I read all the submissions and yours was by far the best . I read yours , too . BRYCE : Hey , Rowley . Hey , Bryce . Yeah , hey , Bryce . Hey , fella . Wow . Everyone knows me now . It 's like I
zone3	Rowley Jefferson ? I need to see you in my office , now . (
zone3	school_bell_ringing ) MR . WlNSKY : I just took a call from a Mrs . Irvine about what happened to the kindergarteners last week . She was very upset . And so am I . What ? You violated the sacred trust . This ... This badge is supposed to mean something , and you just spat on it . I can barely even look at you . I really do n't ... Just save it . You are officially suspended from Safety Patrol . And I expect a full apology to the kindergarteners . Yes , sir . Hey . What did he have to say ? I 'm kicked off . I do n't even know what he 's talking about . Rowley ? What ? Nothing . You 've been home for an hour and have n't badgered me for any snacks . Are you feeling okay ? Well , I 'm kind of in a tough situation . I know something and if I tell the truth about it , it
zone3	it could hurt somebody else . Well , you have to trust your gut and try to do the right thing , because it 's our choices that make us who we are . Okay . GREG : I was up all night , tossing and turning , thinking about my mom 's advice . And I finally decided to do the right thing . I 'm sorry I terrorized you , children . What ? I decided to let Rowley take one for the team . But I 'm not entirely sure that was the right call . Hey , how 's it going ? Well , I was pretty upset about being suspended from Safety Patrol , but then I just started drawing a bunch of Zoo-wee Mamas and I felt better . Look . I put you in this week 's cartoon . And you even get to say , " Zoo-wee Mama . " Wow . That 's really nice . So , listen . It 's kind of funny , you know , the whole Safety Patrol thing . Yeah ? Ready for the funny
zone3	those kids ! What ? Yeah , and I think we can both learn some valuable lessons from this . Like , I should be more careful what I do in front of Mrs . Irvine 's house . And you , well , you should be more careful who you lend your coat to . You know what , Greg ? You 're not a good friend . Whoa . How could you even say that ? I 'm a great friend . If you were a great friend , you would have told Mr . Winsky the truth . Okay , one thing . You ca n't get mad about just ... You only care about yourself . You hated my cartoon . You made fun of my clothes . You disrespected Joshie . You broke my hand and you did n't even seem sorry . That broken hand was the best thing that ever happened to you ! Do n't call me . Do n't come by my house . We 're done . I thought the whole thing would blow over . But Rowley was still
zone3	to make the first move . Yeah . So , anyway , I was so angry at him , I did n't know what to say . MR . WlNSKY : One of the kindergarteners finally told their parents the whole story . Greg ? You 're relieved of your Safety Patrol duties , effective immediately . Rowley , for showing dignity under false suspicion , I am promoting you to team captain . Now , that 's a position that I held for two years . I know you 'll honor it . ( **33;1389;TOOLONG ) Okay You 're supposed to be my friend We 're supposed to get along Hey , you 're supposed to be my friend Hey , Rowley , my mom says it 's okay for me to sleep over tonight . Awesome ! GREG : The whole thing with Rowley is , I was willing to let bygones be bygones . But then he made friends with coilin just to mess with me . As if I even care if he ... Well , you know what ? Two can play at that game
zone3	need to board the helicopter . Do you have my back ? I will always have your back , Captain . Yeah , maybe I 'll meet up with some friends Yeah , maybe I 'll meet up with some dogs ' Cause you 're supposed to be You 're supposed to be Supposed to be my friend You 're supposed to be my friend now Hey . Hey , Greg Heffley . So , I was thinking maybe you might want to have a sleepover ? Yeah . With who ? Me . Yeah , when ? Now . Greg Heffley , I love you ! We are going to be best friends forever ! Wan na have a tickle fight ? Okay . Let 's get inside . FREGLEY : I ca n't believe it ! Greg Heffley 's in my room ! Greg Heffley 's in my room , Rebecca . What do you want to do , Greg Heffley ? How about Twister ? GREG : I 'm not really that much of a Twister guy . Candy ! Wait ! No , no , no
zone3	think we should save those for later ! Maybe we should go outside and ... My mom does n't let me have sugar . She says high glucose in my diet induces hyperactivity . But it 's so good ! Greg Heffley , you want to jumpety-jump ? Yeah , you know what , Fregley ? I just remembered , I have an appointment , a really important appointment . It 's a homework appointment . Yeah , and I really should be going . Get away from me ! ( EXCLAlMlNG ) I can fly ! Whoa . How fun , Greg Heffley ! Greg ? Greg , Greg , Greg , Greg , Greg ? Greg ? Greg ? (
zone3	banging_on_door ) I hear you breathing , Greg Heffley . FREGLEY : Dear Gregory I 'm very sorry I chased you with a booger on my finger . Here , I put it on this paper so you can get me back . What ? All right . GREG : Okay , enough . I 'll show Rowley I do n't need him . When he sees me

Please refer to the lyrics on this handout . I will pick out the best voices and place you accordingly .

Prove me wrong . Tell me the first thing my wife ever said to me . Real psychics know that kind of shit , Sam . I look forward to your next call , Detective .

To do that , you 'd actually have to leave your apartment . Sorry . That was just a joke . Anyway , I leave my apartment . In fact , I went out just this morning to see my psychoanalyst . Great . No , seriously , Jenna . That 's ... That 's great . What did she have to say ? She agreed with me that it 's really unhealthy that we never talk about what happened in the fire . Please ! Let me out ! She said that the more I know about what happened , the more I 'll be free of it . Seriously . Can we talk about it ? What is there to talk about ? Jenna , were you gon na pay this , or ... The police said that it was a gas leak , but you came in from outside .
zone3	was coming from . I thought it was the neighbor 's house , - so I went outside to look . - And you got a ladder ? - Yeah ! - It just does n't make any sense .

I 'll come by tomorrow . Promise ? What are we , in the third grade ? Promise ? Pinky swear . All right . Get some sleep tonight , okay ? Can I help you ? You do n't recognize me . Elizabeth Brown ? Rebecca 's sister ? Nice to see you , too . I 'm sorry
zone3	. Yes . It 's all right . Here , let me clean off this seat for you ... No . Do n't . Sam , do n't worry about it . Get this crap out of the way . So what brings you to my part of town ? I came ... I came back for the execution . They 're executing Lonnie on Friday . Lethal injection . Lonnie ... Lonnie Flennons . The guy that ki ... The guy they say killed Rebecca . Sam ... You act like you do n't know what I 'm talking about . No , I ... I ... Yeah . Of course . I just had n't thought about Rebecca in a long time , that 's all . You want a drink ? It 's clean . So ... What are you doing here ? Lonnie did n't kill my sister . - And how do you know that ? - Well ... Because I found this diary when I was helping my parents move . Rebecca wrote about you a lot , Sam . About how much she
zone3	convince the jury during the trial that , you know , they were ... having a relationship ? - Do you remember ? - Yeah , I remember . It was true , Sam . Rebecca was cheating on you . I know this hurts . Look . May 18th , 1998 . " Someone has been following me . " It 's definitely not Sam . " He does n't know about Lonnie , but I have to tell him . " I feel so guilty . I do n't know what to do . " I took this diary to the cops . They say it 's ... it 's not sufficient evidence to reopen the case . - Well , if that 's what they say ... - And then , I talked to your friend . Detective Glenn ? Sam ... he told me that you have a way of knowing things that nobody else knows ? That ... That you can ... see into crime . Sam , I want to hire you . I have $5,000 in cash . Okay ? Here . -
zone3	It 's complicated . I 'm sorry . - Complicated . But ... the guy that killed Rebecca got away . And Lonnie Flennons , an innocent man , a man she loved , is going to die . I wish I could help . I do . I ... I 'm sorry . Sam ... Okay . Elizabeth . You forgot this . Keep it . She would have wanted you to have it . So , um ... Tell me about this dead girl . Did you love her ? Rebecca Brown , first girl I ever fell for . You never thought about jumping back before ? Thought about it a hundred times . I just ... But you 'd know better . Sam , this is serious shit . There 's two big rules . You never jump back to alter your own past . And you never jump unsupervised . What if I just go back and nobody sees me ? If I ... If I do exactly as you taught me and just observe ? Come on , man . Let 's be honest
zone3	go back and watch your girlfriend get murdered , - and not intervene ? - I 've seen dozens of people killed right before my eyes , and I have n't lifted a finger . Well , this is different , Sam . You 've seen for yourself what happens if you ... if you break these rules . Your sister dies in a fire . You jump back , thinking you can save her . And you do . But what you did n't expect was that your parents were gon na die instead . You try to save one life . You kill two . How many times you got ta jump back before you know the rules ? 15 ? 20 ? Enough to know I do n't want to do it any more . Exactly . You know , you nearly fried your brain . You ca n't handle that many overlaps . It 'll drive you crazy . Can we get another round here , sweetheart ? Save it , Goldburg . You gave me an " F " in freshman physics , remember ?
zone3	. You start tipping , I might . Keep the change . Everybody 's happy . I know it 's hard , man . But for whatever reason , your girl Rebecca had to die . And I 've had to live with it . Not saving someone 's life is n't the same thing as killing them , Sam . No . But it 's close . You do a good thing , Sam . You bring a lot of closure to people . Everybody but myself . You got ta stop living in the past . You got ta get this girl out of your mind . She 's dead . You 're never gon na see her again . And if you want to help this poor death-row bastard , then you better find a way to do it in the here and now . It 's like my ex-wife used to say before she ran off to Ecuador with the fucking gardener . You got ta live in the moment , man . This one 's on the house . Thanks . What is it ?
zone3	! What 's wrong ? I 'm sorry . I ca n't . I just ca n't . Come on . Please . Vicky , I need to be alone right now . Do you want to talk about it ? No . Oh , okay . That 's fine . I really know how to pick ' em , huh ? It 's nothing personal . What ? Are you ... Are you gay ? I could introduce you to my friend Brendan . He 's gay , too . Maybe you guys could hang out ! Well , I 'll be sure to give you his number , and you can go , you know , do man things . Sound good ? Rebecca ... Lonnie ... Hey , Liz . It 's Sam . I changed my mind . I 'll help you out . You got five minutes . Hello . Hey , Lonnie . Sam Reide . Remember me ? South Pontiac High . South Pontiac Grizzly Bears . I 'm here to help you . Look , Lonnie . I know you did n't
zone3	. Why are you here ? I just told you . You here to laugh at me ? No , look , Lonnie . I know you loved Rebecca . I know she loved you . I know what was going on . She wrote all about it , right here . What are you trying to do ? We can get a new trial . Look , Lonnie . I do n't think you heard me . This is new evidence . The police do n't want to reopen the case , but we can request a stay of execution . New evidence . New trial . - You 'll be exonerated . - No . Do you understand ? - I 'm sending this to your lawyer . - No . Lonnie , would you just look at the diary ! It was you . You killed her . And I 've been locked in here for 10 years ! And you 've been free ! You ca n't come in here and do this to me ! You ca n't pretend to be the good guy now
zone3	! You did it , Sam ! You should be in here ! Let 's go . You did it , Sam ! It 's not fair ! It 's not fair . I 'll never get used to this cold . So what 's on the menu tonight ? Homicide ? Rape ? Vehicular manslaughter ? Rebecca Brown . Sam , what are you doing ? It 's okay , Jenna . Just give me the numbers . You 're breaking the rules . They 're my rules to break . You ca n't save her , Sam . I can do this here , the safe way , or I can do it at home by myself and risk everything . - Sam ... - Either way , I 'm gon na do it . This is a bad idea . The numbers . June 6th , 1998 . Murder happened approximately 12:40 a.m . on a Saturday . Who 's in there ? I have a fucking gun . Liz . Liz . It 's me . Sam ? What are you doing ? No , no

If he 's the killer , we 'll know . Paper 's calling our guy the " Pontiac Killer . " You like that name ? What 's his pattern ? He tracks young women , and cuts them apart . Eight victims so far , that we know of . It 's about one a year . Any leads ? You got a lot of questions , buddy . Yeah , well ... You do n't seem to have any answers . Hello ? Jenna . Hey . Sam . Where have you been ? You okay ? I 've been trying to reach you . Uh , no . I 'm fine . I 'm fine . I just ... I need some help . What 's wrong ? You need money ? No . No ... Listen . Jenna , do you remember Lonnie Flennons
zone3	his stupid commercials . Flennons and Monohan , Attorneys at Law . - He 's a lawyer ? - Sam . You need to leave Lonnie alone . What are you talking about ? Did you jump again ? You did , did n't you ? I thought we talked about this . Sam , I 'm worried about you ... Uh , Jenna ... Do n't worry about it , okay ? I 'll be by later , and I 'll explain everything . Okay ... Which office is Lonnie Flennons ' ? Do you have an appointment ? - Is it this one ? - Sir , you ca n't go in there . Sir ! Sir ! You ca n't go in there ! You ca n't go in there ! Sir ! I need to talk to you . I 'm sorry . I told him he could n't come in ... It 's okay . We 're old friends . Where were you the night of the murders ? What is this ? Huh ? Is this our anniversary ? You come in here ,
zone3	? I want to know where you were . You still think I was involved ? Aw , come on . Huh ? Look , everybody knows Becky and Elizabeth were victims of the Pontiac Killer . Jesus . Where you been , living under a rock ? Tell me where you were ! The night they were killed , I thought of stopping by the house . Rebecca called me and told me her parents were out of town . I saw you and Elizabeth talking outside . I thought I should steer clear . She had n't told you about us . I went home , and that was that . I was cleared of all charges . Yeah . Let 's just say your name 's been added back to the suspect pool . I 'm all for antidiscrimination . Hell , I made my living at it . Come on , Sam . Lonnie , what happened ? Stop it . When did this happen ? You do n't remember ? I forget things sometimes . I get confused . I get mixed up . "

I 'm sorry . You know , for the longest time , I was convinced you killed the Brown sisters . - Me ? - Yeah . Rebecca was always afraid you 'd find out about us . She always thought you were watching her . You know , waiting around the corner , spying . Did you kill them , Sam ? No . I did n't . I spent years teaching you to use your gift , and now you 've created the Pontiac Killer . Shit , man . - I can fix it , though . - Good . If I just jump back to the night Rebecca and Elizabeth were killed , except an hour earlier this time . Well , that 's not going to work . I 'll tell you , you go back to

You 'll be altering ... the course of events significantly . So when you get back ... That is , if it worked . When you come back ... No , thank you . Shit , I lost my train of thought .

It 's like all the pieces of the puzzle just shifted around . The only person who could explain it to me is Goldburg , and now he 's disappeared . Yeah , conveniently . - What does that mean ? - Sam , he was going to turn in evidence linking you to the murders . If you had n't fast forwarded through your past , you 'd know that . What are you talking about ? Sam , you trust me , do n't you ? I mean , if you 're doing this for any reason , I 'd never turn you in . This is ridiculous .

Sometimes things are just fucked , Jenna ! And ... And
zone3	, I ... I 'm try ... I 'm try ... - I 'm trying to fix it , but it ... - Sam . I just do n't know why . I 'm too stupid or I 'm too ... I 'm too weak ! - It 's ... I ... It 's just ... - Sam . Sam . It 's going to be okay . It 's the jumping . Just let the police do their job for once . Sam . Promise me you 're not going to jump anymore . Promise . I can fix it , Jenna . No .

I 'm in enough trouble as it is , Sam ! Okay , okay . Listen . I 'm not a psychic . - I knew it . - I time travel . I can go back to wherever I was , and I can watch . And depending upon what happens , I change things . Usually on accident but sometimes on purpose . Do n't ever call me again . No , it 's true ! Glenn ! Glenn !

I told you it would be bad . You followed me back ? Jenna , what about the ... What about the other girls ? What about the ... You did n't know them . They were strangers .

You know we didn " t mean for that to happen . I " m asking you as a friend , give it to us , please . I " m telling you as a friend , I can " t give you the tape . - We " ll take it ourselves . - If the asshole will let me finish . I can " t give you the tape , cos we don " t have one . What " s that ? Look , we got that camera , we got that TV , but that " s it
zone3	never got it fixed . We just keep it there for looks . - So there " s no record of what happened ? - No . except that big-ass mess in there . - Did you hear that ? - I " m working on the mess .

We " re trying to keep our asses out of trouble . Say some thuggish dudes came in and shot up the place . Thuggish dudes ? You mean some black guys , right ? You guys are all the same . If you say it was black dudes they " ll never look for a white fraternity , so say it was two fucking black guys . Your ass better step up to the plate . - I " ll step up . Whatever . - What are you gon na say ? You can " t intimidate me , the cops are on their way . - relax . - Do I intimidate you now ? Stop .
zone3	I need to know . - You hear those sirens ? - What are you gon na say ? - Mike , are you gon na protect us ? Why don " t you stick around and find out ? - So you got the tape ? - Their cameras don " t work , no tape . - You " re sure ? Positive ? - Yeah . He said yes . So , that-that " s great . We " re in the clear ? What ? What " s the matter ? - Whoa ! What the fuck ? - Shit ! What the fuck is this ? - That " s Mike . - I know who the fuck it is . Why did you bring him here ? I told you to get the tape . - He is the tape , he was gon na tell the cops . - So you took him hostage ? We didn " t have a choice , he wouldn " t cover for us . This is the only way to protect us . What happens when

First of all , shut the fuck up ! OK , Bean called a doctor , a real doctor . He " s gon na be here soon . We didn " t take him to the hospital because we got the bleeding to stop . Why can " t we go get him
zone3	is on the way . He " s gon na take care of Kevin . Why would we take Kevin to a doctor , when a doctor " s coming to us ? It " s the same thing . This is a good move . Taking a hostage didn " t make things easier . Talk to your friend about that . You let him decide ? You " re a leader , Adam . OK , y-you ... You " re supposed to lead the guys coming up under me , all right ? I need you and Kevin needs you . These other ... These other guys are fucking crazy . Graham ? Yeah , right ! And Scott ?

We can " t just hope that he " s gon na say what we want him to . - Graham ! - Yeah . - This is your job , you took the guy . - What ? Adam told me the clerk will say it was two black guys . We need to make sure they don " t turn into two white fraternity members , when he talks to the police . - How are we gon na do that ? - We were gon na use Adam " s story . Adam " s story ? What story ? - You didn " t tell him . - Tell me what ? - The story doesn " t fucking help us . - Will someone tell me what " s going on ? Adam knows some shit on the clerk
zone3	supposed to help us ? - He knows some serious shit . We let him know - if he tells the cops about us , we " ll tell the cops about him . You don " t get it . If I tell the cops what I know about him it " s just the same shit they " ve heard a million times already . It " s just a rumour . I have no proof that " s gon na force him to keep his mouth shut . We need a way to prove this thing . - If we find proof , that " s our leverage ? - exactly . I guess . So what " s this story of yours ? How the hell are we gon na prove this fucking thing ? Jesus . It was two black guys , OK ? I " ll say whatever you want . Can I go ? - Why couldn " t you have said that earlier ? - That " s what I was gon na say . If I " d known I was

OK , but ... keep in mind that there " s some shit that I know about you . Yeah , right , man . I " m sure you do . Some shit from high school . It " s not pretty . Don " t play dumb . You know what I " m talking about , don " t you ? Basketball party , junior year , that girl ... - You

Listen , I don " t care whether you say you did or you didn " t , as far as I " m concerned , you talk about us , I have to talk about you , then everything that night gets brought back up again . They dropped the charges , why ? Cos no one would talk . Until now . Listen , maybe you didn " t do anything wrong . Maybe they " ll take pity on you because you were the only one who had enough respect to put a condom on that broomstick that you poked ... I said I " m not gon na tell anybody , OK ? What do you want from me ? - So you admit it ? You admit it ? - You know that " s not what happened . Tell me what happened , Mike . All right ,

How long " s it been ? - An hour or two , at most . - That sounds about right . If there " s no tissue damage , I " m not saying definitely , - but he " ll probably be OK for a little while . - What do you mean " if " ?

Where are you getting that from ? - Stop . Bottom line , he " s OK

If I take care of Mike will you take Kevin to a hospital ? What ? I can get the leverage on Mike if you take Kevin to a hospital . How ? What did you get all of a sudden ? What just happened ? - Say you " ll take Kevin , or there " s no deal . - What did you just fucking hear ? Say you " ll take Kevin , or you " re never gon na find out . We don
zone3	s time , I can get us out of this . We can wait all night and you can wait for something to happen , or you can end it right now by saying he goes . If you have something on Mike that gets him out this house and ensures we weren " t at that store , then Kevin goes . - Is that tape recorder working yet ? - Yeah . It works . Let " s go . Hurry . We " re gon na get you out of here , all right ? Listen to him ! - Listen to what he " s telling you . - You better talk to us . What the fuck is this ? Looks like something out of a horror movie .

I need to know where the money is , Mike . Listen to me ,
zone3	pay you , if that " s what it takes . But I know that that money is missing . I need to know where it is , and Kevin goes to the hospital . If you let me know where the money is , you walk away from this , we all walk away . Tell me where the money is . I took it , OK ? I saw my chance and I took it . So what ? All you had to do was say something and we would have let you go . How am I supposed to know that , huh ? How am I supposed to know that ? You just keep fucking with me . I don " t know what you want . OK ? Trying to tape-record some bullshit that happened , what , a year ... two years ago , huh ? I didn " t do that shit . I didn " t do it . There were three other cats there messing with that girl . I tried to stop that shit from happening . I tried to
zone3	get her to leave ... - I don " t need to know . You " re gon na listen to me ! I tried to get her to walk away , and the dumbass kept walking back , and those dudes kept fucking with her . So fuck you , man . OK ? You can call me a bad person for taking that money , but ... I didn " t touch her . I didn " t touch that girl . Fuck you , man . I " m sorry , but my friend is bleeding upstairs and I need to get him some help . I " m sorry . You have your money , we have our leverage . - I don " t want the money , man . I don " t want it . - Then we " ll get you a ride home . - I want nothing to do with you cats . - Scott , we need to go get Kevin now , OK ? Tell me one more time why you wouldn " t say two black guys
zone3	would have trouble believing the money was stolen by a nigger . Leave him alone . Tell me your story for the police , so we can make sure everything " s cool . The only way everything is cool ... is if we put that money back . What ? Yeah . Yeah , you heard me . The only way I " m cool ... is if you take that money back to the store . Are you out of your fucking mind ? No , no ! You have something on us , we have something on you . This is over . Get Kevin to the hospital . Get Kevin to the hospital right now ! What the fuck good is it gon na do to take the money back ? If a white boy takes the money back , the black clerk won " t get blamed for stealing . No one is gon na think you took the money . Everyone think I touched that girl ? You did . You did . Why ? Cos I " m black and I was there
zone3	stole that money - cos I " m black and I was there . I " m gon na make sure no one thinks I stole that money , cos a white boy " s taking it back . - You are not gon na tell us what to do . - Yes , I am . Listen to me . I " d rather take my chances with the cops than walk out of here knowing you got shit on me . When I walk outta here , I " m walking out crystal clean . Let " s calm down and think this through , OK ? That " s a crime scene . We " re not taking stolen money back to a crime scene . The owner has another store . Take the money there . No ! You " re gon na take your fucking money and leave . We are not taking the money back to your store , a different store or any other store . Listen to me . You " re walking away with three grand . We could give you
zone3	take it back . But we can " t take it back . You can have the tape , we can " t take it back . No , no , we " re not giving you the tape , we " ll destroy it but it " s not leaving this room . Remember , back at the store , you asked what I was gon na say to the cops ? Yeah . There " s only one way to guarantee I " ll say what you want me to say . That " s by taking that money back . That is not gon na happen . The last thing we " re gon na do is take stolen money - your stolen money - back to a convenience store , period . Well , that " s the deal . I " ve been screwed over all night . Now it " s your turn to get fucked . - What are we gon na do ? - We got ta think of something . - What ? - I don " t know . -
zone3	fucking know ! Did you not hear me ? - I " ll do it . - What ? I " ll do it . We don " t have a fucking plan . If this means Kevin " s gon na go to a hospital , I " ll do it . - You " re gon na do this for this guy ? - I " m gon na do it for Kevin , too . Don " t let him out of your sight , he " ll go to the cops . Fuck you . If you don " t trust me , you can do it yourself . That " s what I thought , so before we waste any more time , let " s do this ! You don " t have any alternatives . You have to use me . Let " s go . All right , shut the fuck up ! We " ll fucking do it ! Make sure you put that money in the safe and bring me some proof . I don " t trust you motherfuckers
zone3	s get it on . Where we going ? Get him up . Come on , one , two , three . Watch it . Get the door . Easy . Slide him in . As soon as the money " s back , we " re good . The owner was missing a few grand , and now it " s back . Nobody " s bringing in the fbi and the cops have bigger stuff to be concerned with . All right ? Here . I don " t want that . It " s better to have it and not need it . No . What are we doing ? Waiting to make sure Adam does what he " s supposed to . What ? Oh my God ! Oh my God ! Just chill the fuck out . Just chill out . I " m not gon na hurt you . I need you to get this to the guy who owns the store . I robbed the store earlier on Roslyn , OK ? O - OK . - Here it is . - I
zone3	! You don " t have to explain , I don " t want trouble . No , stop ! That " s not what I want . That is not what I want . OK . OK . Holy shit ! Has he done that before ? Coughed up blood ? No . We have to go . - Just hang on . Any minute . - He " s gon na fucking die on us ! Chill the fuck out ! We are waiting on the call ! This is not a robbery . I just want to give this back . So , open up the safe . This isn " t a robbery , but you want the safe open ? What is this exactly ? I just wan na give the money back ! Please just open up the safe ! Get outta here ! Go ! Please just open up the safe . Oh , shit . Pardon me if I " m confused . We don " t normally get guys wearing masks ... give us money . Let me remember the combination
zone3	! - Put it down and get outta here ! - Put it down ! Put it down ! Stop ! Look ! We don " t want this . None of us want this . I just need to give this to you . - Wan na get shot ? Take the fucking money ! - Shut the fuck up ! Shut up ! I " m not robbing you . Look at me . I " m not robbing you . Listen , just take this money , I " ll give you more money too , OK ? No one will get hurt . Take this , put it in the safe . Take some for yourself . - Put it in the fucking safe ! - Chill the fuck out and wait outside ! Get out , both of you ! Please take the money and put it in the safe ! No . No ! No ! No ! Stop ! If he goes away ... If he goes the fuck away , will you put your gun down ? Put your fucking gun down
zone3	Not before he does . - The gun isn " t pointed at you ! Put your fucking gun down and go ! OK .

zone3	3698161 Thank you . My brother was on the negotiating committee , and I was counselor forthe Sinaltrainal union . Outside the plant there was a stand where they sold food . These guys arrived and asked , " Who 's Isidro ? " Isidro was checking a truck leaving the plant . That was his job . He opened the gate forthe truck . The truck drove out , and those guys went in after it and shot him . Nine times they shot him , according to the autopsy . They shot him and left . As soon as the union was formed , the problems started . Their goal was always the same : do away with the union . They said business was very bad . On December 5 we reached the deadline for negotiating the collective agreement , which had been submitted November 30 . Their answer was to murder one of the negotiators . That negotiator was my brother . I had to flee . I fled because I was also on their hit list . They started with my brother , and Adolfo Cardona , but he managed to escape , like all
zone3	do you expect from the trial in the US ? What am I expecting ? That there will be proof of the links between Coca-Cola and the paramilitaries , and that there was a connection and support by some multinationals forthe paramilitary groups . How would you preferto die ? We must realize that the wave of threats and other pressure tactics mean a lot of people are afraid . We will keep repeating : they will not succeed in destroying the union by any means . We will recruit new members , wherever ... even under rocks , if need be . What the company managers and the government are trying to do with all their dirty campaigns to discredit the Sinaltrainal union is to put an end to the political project of workers in the union . Twice they tried to kill me . They tried abducting my three children and my wife too . I 've been taken to court more than ten times by the Coca-Cola Company on all kinds of false pretences . We started the campaign after we had alerted the US and Colombian
zone3	proceedings were classified . An absolute injustice , a total impunity ! When we heard of the American law allowing us as Colombians affected by Coca-Cola to sue the company in the US , that 's when we contacted the Steelworkers and Terry and filed the cases against Coca-Cola . Workers who hear us ... - Come join the struggle ! - The Coca-Cola union ... - Is present in the struggle ! Long live the first of May ! Let us remember our comrades , and respect their memory . They fought and sacrificed their lives to achieve their great ideal . Comrades , today we raise ourfists and march , united in our resolve , Our victories and our union , we defend with faith and resolve ! What about the Coke investigation ? We have n't heard about Coke . Not from the office in Geneva , the union sector , orthe employer 's sector . Until now , our office has not received any request . Why did Coke 's CEO say that you are doing an investigation about the killing of Coke workers here in
zone3	ILO representation here is not . Ok , man . That 's fine . Ok , brother . That 's great . Good luck . Thanks , man . That 's our man . Incredible ! Which journalist ? Ajournalist from El Tiempo . - El Tiempo ? - Yeah . - He 's going to write ... - Yeah . The case is closed . Good thing I read El Tiempo every day . It 's my favorite newspaper . I 've been a union leader for 16 years , and in those 16 years they 've assassinated ten of my fellow union and federation members . It 's common practice for national and multinational companies and forthe Colombian government to murder unionists to increase their profits . Drummond Co . is accused of paying paramilitaries directly . We have proof showing that it is directly responsible forthe murder of three unionists and forthe massacre of innocent people by the paramilitary groups it pays . As Dan Kovalik already said , Chiquita uses the same tactics and is accused of arms trafficking . Coca-Cola is accused of using paramilitaries
zone3	to work at Coca-Cola ? First of all , to get a route you need a guarantor . Secondly , on the route you are responsible for whatever happens . If we are attacked , it 's our problem . If we 're robbed of $100 or $200 , it comes out of our pocket . We have to pay forthe insurance , our uniforms . We have to cover all the expenses . Coca-Cola rents us the truck . We have to pay for it everyday . And also for any lost or broken bottles and crates . Or crates that the client forgets . Let me put it differently : What does the company provide ? - Zip . - Zilch . Nothing at all . Theirtrucks . It 's the workers who are responsible for everything . Coca-Cola does n't provide anything at all . Are you unionized ? Those who are unionized work inside the plant . Whoevertries to join the union ... In general , I think union members are the old guys . You ca n't join the union . Oryou 'll be fired
zone3	grow . - What 's going on ? - It 's forthe news . For where ? Canada . - Where ? - Canada . I 'm with security at Coca-Cola . " What would I do without my Coke ? " Why should we go on negotiating on the basis of Coca-Cola 's demands without considering our own ? It makes no sense . Our position is : either Coca-Cola substantially changes its position orthere 'll be no deal . We have to force the company to produce a text in Spanish . They have the money and people for it . If they have the money to keep fucking us , they must have the time and money to solve a little problem like a translation . Ok , see you . Thanks . We do n't intend to give up ourfight with the company . And as I 've said before , nor will we accept that people make money on us as victims . Coca-Cola must pay forthe past , in memory of the victims . We say , " You were involved in those crimes
zone3	. " The whole truth must come out . Coca-Cola has to explain how it benefited from and participated in the crimes . Or all the money they 'd give us would mean nothing . We are negotiating against U.S . politics . We are fighting the neoliberal model of flextime , job uncertainty , cost cuts , no unions , no collective agreements . That 's why it 's so important that we win . These negotiations are political , not economic . If the issue was money , we 'd have come with our attach ? - case . We 'd have said , Hand overthe dough , you shits . We 'd have gone home happy to do whatever we wanted with the money . We came back to Colombia convinced that we had an agreement . Then they sent us the text of the agreement . In it , Coca-Cola muzzled the union . We had to stop all world campaigns . We could n't contact anyone with links to multinationals and were specifically forbidden to campaign against Nestle , Occidental , BP , and so
zone3	to abandon the Permanent People 's Tribunal and say we 'd dropped all charges against Coke , such a good , respectable company : We had n't agreed to any of this . While we were negotiating with the company in good faith ... looking for a political solution , they went on fanning the fire . The threats kept coming , workers kept being fired . They kept trampling on workers ' rights , threatening theirfamilies . A child was abducted by paramilitaries , who are still in the Coca-Cola plants . They kept sending letters like the one you saw . What 's the point of settling with them , if things keep getting worse ? If , in spite of a world campaign and ourtalks with Atlanta , things are so bad now , just imagine ... The day we settle , they 'll kill us ! Do n't feel guilty for what is n't yourfault . Because of you , many people are still alive and the union still exists in its current state . That in itself is very positive . How much did you

zone3	4195898 " He would not take no for an answer . Our young hero traveled a great many leagues , beneath the ocean 's surface to find his shackled mermaid , and he had no intention of leaving without her . However , the evil sea king had other plans . Like a madman driven by love and revenge , the diver unsheathed his speargun and fired . His harpoon struck the merman 's heart , and blood shot out like a miniature geyser . The bubble surrounding the princess burst , as two tiger sharks ravaged the king 's lifeless body , scattering his guts across the sea like a quilted feather pillow . Yet , amid the melee , the diver bent down on one knee , and his hand held out a small pearl . The princess smiled . ' Do n't bother , ' she said . ' I 've already packed . ' And so they rode off on the back of a white whale , and with a bouquet of plankton , they were betrothed . The End . " Very good , very good . Thank you . Okay , I thought that
zone3	you kidding me ? That was amazing . It was so great to see you in action back there . Yeah , it felt good . Tell me your thoughts on the ending . What did you think of the diver ending up with the mermaid ? You thought that was too easy ? Easy ? No , not at all . I mean , I felt that , like , it was the only way that it could have ended . Yeah , I agree , and I 'm the writer . Here we go . Are ... are we in a rush or something ? I 'm not in a rush . We just got a full weekend ahead of us . We got so many things to do . What is that ? Oh , just some books ... And this . You ... you recommended this to me a long time ago . You said you felt like it was written about you , so ... Yeah , well ... Those were my younger and more vulnerable years . Do you mind , sir ? This
zone3	Fuck you , asshole ! This is a lot of goddamn luggage for three days , buddy . We 're not going on safari . We 're going on a vacation . Well , I-I was n't exactly sure what to be prepared for . I mean , you were n't very specific over the phone . I guess I was n't . And ... and , you know , I wanted to look nice if there was gon na be girls at the hotel . Yeah , there might be girls at the hotel . You need to relax , buddy . That 's not the point of the trip . You do n't have to worry yourself about girls . This trip is about us going on boat rides in the sun . We got to read some books . I got to read things to you out loud . You 've been hiding from me in your parents ' apartment , you little prince . It 's time to get you out of there . Okay . I mean , I do n't really feel like I
zone3	feel like you 've been hiding from me , maybe . I feel like we had lunch not that long ago . No . No , I do n't ... I 'm not ... I do n't think I 've seen you in like a year , Sam . - A year ? - Yeah , at least . A year ? I got a little present for you . - What is this ? - Open it . What ? It just reminds me of the buck knife you used to carry around in your belt loop when we were campers . Remember ? The one that I lost ? - Yeah . - That 's why I got it . Whose , uh ... whose initials are these ? Those are yours , buddy . No , it says N.B . No , I know , that 's my friend Noah Bressman . He does n't use it , though . I took it from him . Thank you . It 's ... perfect , Sam . Happy birthday , kid . Thanks . It 's not my
zone3	birthday , you silly goose . Consider it early for next year . Oh , my God . I 've just been so busy lately with this book , Marshall . That 's what it is . That 's why I 'm so lousy at keeping in touch . I know , I know , I know , it 's ... it 's fine , man . It has nothing to do with you personally , though . - Yeah , and ... - You know that . Yeah , no , I know . I know I do n't have to tell you that , but I should . And I do have to say that I think it 's really admirable that you 're able to , like , come up with these amazing characters and everything and still keep a real job during the day , you know ? That is my real job , actually . Waitress , can we get the check ? Thank you . You know , I was about ready to take on the job market myself . I sent out some
zone3	my dad set up , and then , you know , the whole disaster happened , and I had to move back in with my parents , and , you know , at first it was hard for me to even leave my own room , and before I knew it , eight months had just flown on by . Jesus Christ , Marshall , that 's what I 'm saying . The guy I know used to be a crazed wild man . You 're nothing like that anymore . What happened ? When did you start smoking ? Recently . You probably should n't be doing it at a gas station . That 's an old wives ' tale , Marshall . You 're gon na love this hotel , by the way , pal . Really ? I 'll tell you , it might as well have a goddamn Michelin star . What 's it like ? It 's very elegant , very warm , got a real old-world kind of flavor to it . It 's like they put the plaza at the countryside . Oh
zone3	this is the place we 're staying at ? Uh , no . I think we made a wrong turn , actually . We 're staying down the road , I think . Oh . Huh . Ah , she 's got a lot of baggage . Out of my way . It 's a wedding , everybody . Let 's get ' em . Do you know these people or something ? No , I do n't know these people . How the hell would I know these people ? Can I help you , gentlemen ? Are you here for the weekend ? Uh , no , I think we 're all right , thanks , actually . Yeah , we 're ... we 're not here for the weekend . We ... we were staying down the road a piece . We just made a wrong turn . Then you should leave immediately . This car is smoking profusely . Unbelievable , that guy . Honestly , can you believe that ? Yeah . It was very condescending , his tone , was n't it ? I
zone3	bad . I think he was just doing his job . The place seemed really exclusive , you know . I mean , he just thought we were middle class or something , just by looking at us . I mean , we are middle class . Well , that 's not the point . Hey , pull over really fast . I need to make a quick call . Okay . All righty , you should get us some booze and snackies for the room . I got to make a call . Who are you gon na call ? Get whatever you 'd like . Anything . You just gave me $2 . It should work . Hi . It 's Sam . Hi . It 's Sam . Yeah , hi . It 's Sam . Hi . It 's Sam . Hoo ... Chief , can you just run the card one more time ? Just run the card one more time , sir . Run the goddamn card one more time , please ? He 's giving me the silent treatment . You 're gon
zone3	This guy 's treating me like I 'm a frickin ' criminal . Let me explain something to you , sir . I put money on this card last week . There 's no reason why this card should n't be working right now . That 's the card , by the way . That should go through . Sorry , Marshall . I 'm gon na pay you back . I put money on the card last week . It 's okay . Just calm down . I ca n't calm down , Marshall . You should be angry , too . How could it be unlisted ? I was just there . It 's a big white house with blue shutters . Or maybe they 're black . Does that make any difference whatsoever ? I 'm not authorized to give you ... No , you 're the phone company . You 're supposed to know everything . - There 's no hot water . - I 'm sorry . I ca n't help you . Oh , and I was just made aware there 's no hot
zone3	run a hotel with no hot water ? Anything else , Marshall ? There was a bit of hair in the drain . And there was a full head of hair in the drain . So if you can get a maid up or an electrician , I would really appreciate that , thank you . I 'm sorry , Marshall . I 'm just not gon na let some two-bit Indian treat me like a maniac , you know ? It 's fine . I did n't even think he really did anything . Went completely numb . Marshall , I apologize . I know this was supposed to be a very relaxing weekend , your first weekend being out of the house in a year . I mean , your actions were a little overwhelming , but I 'm just glad that I 'm unpacked and settled in . If I could just take a chance to relax for a little while . Let 's go to the pool . You know , I 've got to tell you , I 'm only on page 37 , but
zone3	about this guy . I feel like it 's written about me or something . It 's kind of haunting . You know what I think ? I think we need to get out of here and have ourselves a drinky . True or false ... you want to meet some women on this trip , right ? I mean , true , but it 's not the most important thing in the world to me . I mean , just sitting here by the pool with you is probably the most exciting thing I 've done all year . Right . That 's all the more reason why we should keep pushing forward . Look , see for yourself . There 's a very interesting thing going on down the beach over there . They 're all old people . Exactly , Marshall . They 're gon na love you . It looks like a blast , man . It 's just ... I do n't know if I 'm ready to dive into a stressful social situation like that right now , you know ? That 's the
zone3	to do this for ourselves , for you . This is your coming-out party . Well , I guess we could stop by for a minute , but I ca n't exactly go over there in my swim trunks , now , can I ? No . But you brought a suit , right ? Well , yeah , you told me to bring one just in case , but I 'd have to sticky-roll it . Well , sticky-roll that thing and blow this joint . Why are we sneaking around like this ? We 're not sneaking around . We 're being mysterious . Look , Marshall , it 's sunny out . I still do n't get what I 'm supposed to say to these people . You just pretend like you fit in , and you 'll be fine . It 'll be like the time we went to the Harmony Club and took steam showers with all those old guys . They did n't question us , did they ? We just need to find somebody who can help us get acclimated to the party
zone3	. Then when the time is right , we 'll peacock ourselves around and show ourselves off to some of these older women , you know what I mean ? By the way , feel free to make shit up about yourself , like a job or something . This guy 's perfect . Hey , excuse me . Ahoy , amigo ! He seems kind of strange . Let 's go . Wait , do n't go anywhere . Is there a problem , Officers ? I have n't done anything . Let me ask you a question . What 's a guy like you doing by yourself when the party 's over there ? Just hanging out by the ocean , Officer . Well , we 're , you know , down on the beach , and your party 's rattling our walls a little bit . What kind of dragon do I have to slay to get a drink around these parts ? Pow ! Pow ! I 'm really glad you guys are here . I was getting a little bit bored , to be honest
zone3	No , none of these people are my friends . They do n't even like each other . Huh , you can say that again , right ? That 's why everybody drinks and there are so many pills . Hey , speaking of drinking , let 's drink . Hey , oh ! - Save some for me . - Hey , there she is . Hey , believe it or not , but this one 's been in a ladies ' prison , boys . Really ? That 's funny . So has Marshall . May I ? Oh , I love the flavor of this brand . Very smooth . Yeah , you 'd like it a lot more if you inhaled it . No . I-I did . Sweetie , look , dolphins ! It 's terrible . All right . This is the smartest thing we 've ever done , by the way . So , what do we do now ? What do you mean , what do we do now ? Who do you like ? What girl ? I mean , she
zone3	. Everybody here is sad , Marshall . That 's why we could really clean up in a place like this . However , I do n't think you should be focused on the maid . I would focus on that redhead over there , though . She seems elegant . She 'd be lucky to have sex with you . She 's laughing at us . Laugh back at her . No , that 's what these people do here , Marshall . They laugh at you . That 's why we could really clean up . Because we 're the young bloods . You know what I mean ? Apparently , he arranged a screening at some theater ... Uh , uh , I think I got something . Let 's go fishing . Right . Right . I heard it was her favorite movie . " Brief " something or other . - " Brief Encounter . " - What ? " Brief Encounter " ... the film you were talking about . It 's based on Noel Coward 's play called " Still Life , "
zone3	have been around for that , actually . - Who are you ? - Oh , I 'm Sam Davis . Nice to meet you . I 'm a published author of several children 's stories and such . Oh . This is my friend Marshall , by the way . - Marshall , say hi to the captain . - Hi . Tell them what you do , Marshall . Oh , I-I do n't actually do anything right now . I have n't really been in a healthy enough state to even fathom holding down a real job , you know . Marshall 's a comedian , actually . No . The truth is , that I 've just been going through kind of a rough patch right now , and so I have n't really been putting myself out there . Just been too exhausted , but , uh ... uh , when I do , I think I might want to be an actor . Or a sea captain . How do you get into that ? Excuse me . - Look at you . -
zone3	, you look amazing right now . Honestly , you are such a sight . - Look at you in this light . - Answer the question , Sam . Have you grown ? I think you 've grown . Maybe it 's just your posture , but you seem a little taller . I do n't know ... Seriously , Sam , what the fuck are you doing here ? What are you talking about ? Your brother invited me . - Why are you acting like this ? - You 've never even met my brother . That 's not true , actually . We just met down on the other side of the beach , and he invited me to come and have a few drinks and say hi , so I 'm just saying hi . You ca n't be here , Sam . You have to leave . Did n't you get my postcard ? Which postcard ? You send me a lot of postcards . Why are you acting like this ? I have n't seen your face ... Hey , look at this
zone3	. - Yes , it is . Is n't she pretty ? Coincidentally , your sister and I have already met , and I agree ... she 's completely beautiful . - No . - All right . - So , Teddy , you met Sam , then , yeah ? - Thank you , Teddy . - Yeah . - Sam Davis . Oh , Sammy Davis . You sly fox , man . No ... All right . Well , I 'm gon na go find your friend , man . It 's on me . - You brought a friend ? - Yeah , he drives . Listen , do you want to go somewhere and get a drink ? Oh , my God . No , I ... no , I ca n't , okay ? - I would like to talk to you . - No . No , no , no , no . You have got to leave now . I 'm not going anywhere . Oh , there she is ... my beautiful , elusive woman . Can I steal you away
zone3	Of course . - Who are you ? Are you ... ? This is Whit . I 'm ... Whit , I 'm Sam Davis . Pleasure to finally meet you . Sam . I 've heard many , many things about you . Zoe 's told me many things . - Oh . Big Sam . - Mm-hmm . Of course you are ! Come here ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God . Finally , a chance to meet the famous Sam Davis ! Yeah . Darling , you did n't tell me you invited Big Sam for the weekend . I did n't , but Sam 's not gon na stay very long . Yeah , no . I wo n't be staying long at all . It 's really just a funny coincidence , because our hotel shares a beach with your miniature castle over here , and , uh , we ran into Teddy , and he invited me to say hi , so , just saying hi . You 'll have to forgive me , but the way Zoe speaks of
zone3	strapping fellow , what with all the " Sam sent me this " and " Sam wrote me that . " Right . You 're far slighter than I imagined . Well , it looks like Zoe 's telling you some tall tales , then , I guess . He is funny . You were right . Hey , you Mick , you 've got a lot of fucking nerve showing up here . Oh , come on . Thanks for inviting me . I will take out your fucking front two teeth if you keep this up . - Is n't he something ? - What 's with the little mustache ? What ? I forgot I even had it , actually . Do you like it ? Hmm . I like you better without it . Fuck off , but do me a favor and stay close by ' cause I want to talk to you about the idea I just had . I 'm so sorry about that . Bruce and I spearhead the Little Foot Foundation together . We made 10,000 pairs of open-toed adjustable sandals
zone3	feel good , you know ? Yeah , it should . Huh . - You need a drink . - Yeah . So , tell me , Sam , where was it you said you were staying ? My friend Marshall and I are staying at this neat little native American place called " The Little Mohican Inn . " It 's a fantastic place . You guys should go if you ever have an opportunity . Now , listen , Sam , we 've got to take this photograph , but it seems a bloody waste for you and Marvin to stay in that Indian shit hole when we 've got this big , lovely house all to ourselves . No . No , no , no , no , no ! Every room is ... - Are n't you gorgeous ? ... full in the house . I 'm sure we can find a place for these two to bunk up in . It 's your rule ... the more the merrier . You know , it 's so rare that we have the whole gang out to
zone3	what is the occasion , by the way ? You have n't told him , have you ? Of course I have . No , no , no , no , you have n't told me . I do n't know what 's going on . Somebody , please , tell me the good news finally . Zoe and I are getting married on Sunday . Yes ! Married ? ! Really ? And it 's my birthday ! That where I got ... And here , too . You ca n't really see a scar , though , because I have an amazing plastic surgeon . Excuse us for a moment . Hey , pal . - What am I , a fucking waitress ? - Oh , my goodness . I thought we made an agreement to lie about ourselves . Yeah , but I hate lying . I 'm terrible at it . Oh , you 'll get better , trust me . Who are those people you were talking to ? I think I recognize that guy from someplace . Funny enough , those are some
zone3	. And I 've told you about my friend Zoe , have I not ? - No . - No ? Does n't matter . Anyway ... Uh , listen , I think we should check out of the Mohican and stay here for the weekend . What do you mean ? Well , I mean , I was just extended the invitation for both of us , and I think we ought to take it . But I love the Mohican . It 's got a lot of character . Marshall , people only say that about terrible things when they 're trying to be nice . I mean , look around , pal . Every single person here wants to know who we are , especially that spunky-looking redhead over there . What 's her name ? - Esme . - Esme . Exactly . And I 'm sure that sad maid is around here somewhere lurking around . Those are two very realistic options for you . You 're not gon na get a deal like that at the Mohican . I just ... I do n't
zone3	quality time together if we stayed here . Buddy , listen , this is a golden opportunity here . Okay ? I 'm just saying . I mean ... It 's your call . I told you what I feel . You tell me what you feel . I feel like ... I want to stay at the Mohican . Okay . Third floor , menswear . That old boy put you on the third floor . Marshall , I do n't want to beat the dead horse , but remember , you do n't have to explain everything to everyone all the time , you know what I mean ? Just pepper in a little subtlety here and there . Trust me . What , you 're saying I 'm too obvious ? - I would never say that . Ever . Keep up ! This place is like a playground . You have a canoe , you have golf clubs . You have every sort of ball known to mankind . It is what it is , man . - This place is incredible . I love it
zone3	subtle , Marshall . - What 's that smell ? - Cat shit . Zoe loves cats , right ? She 's got strays running all over , and they all take shits under your bed , man . - Are they rescues ? - Yeah , they 're rescues . She rescues cats , dogs , gerbils ... anything , man . God , that sister of yours . She 's always taking care of everybody . She 's got a lot of love to give , does n't she ? She 's the best . She took care of me from day one on , so ... Look how good you turned out , big guy . Uh-huh . Look , I want to be the guy who takes care of you guys this weekend , okay ? It 's my sister 's wedding . She wants everybody to have fun . So if you guys need anything ... you know , coke , pills ... Oh , actually , I could really use a ginger ale and , like , an aspirin . I kind of got
zone3	do n't smoke . Good boy . I like that . Good answer . Move your shit , man . Move it right now . Get out of my way , man . Hey , it 's a wedding , everybody . See you , Big Ted . I 'm gon na call him Uncle Teddy . It 's hot in here . It 's really hot in here . It 's not that hot . That 's what the fan is for . One of the cats shit in the bathtub . They 're a bunch of strays , Marshall . I 'm just glad they have a home . What is that ? Just , like , a little gift basket . It was left outside the door . Really ? Presents ? Were you reading my journal ? Yeah . Marshall ... When did you start keeping a journal ? Like , about a year ago . You 're a pretty goddamn good writer . Yeah . My therapist thought it would be a good idea . And I know you used to have one , and
zone3	. - Why ? Got a lot of problems . How many problems can you have , Marshall ? You 're 25 years old . Quite a few . Jesus Christ , Marshall . You should prepare me before you tell me something like that . That 's shocking . What kind of stuff they got here ? Oh , a note . How long have you known Zoe , exactly ? Not long . Um , we 're just , you know ... friends of a friend ... that sort of thing . I 'm gon na take a shower , buddy . You should spruce up and , uh , get ready for supper . Let 's not be late , all right ? - Oh , there 's no hot water in there . - That 's fine . That is very funny , and you are , yes , a very sad man . Who wants to hear the story of how we met ? ' Cause I only want to tell this story once . There may be three people at the table that have
zone3	I first asked Zoe to dinner , she laughed in my face . No , I did n't laugh . I did n't laugh . No , it was ... It was an innocent guffaw . Oh , what happened to your mustache ? I look better without it . Can you not be so observant all the time ? Thank you . I hounded this girl for a month to get one dinner with her . I sent flowers to the store where she worked . You did send flowers , and they were beautiful . So I practically stalked you , did n't I ? Oh , that 's charming . God , here we go . Very funny , everybody , laugh it up . It 's a wedding ! For all you guys who do n't know me , my name 's Teddy . That 's my sister . And our parents are dead . Everybody dies . It was a long time ago , and we 're doing okay now , so do n't worry about it . So congratulations from the family . I
zone3	Teddy . - I really , really do . You 're one of the good one's . And you stuck with me when I was all the way down , you know ? And you always have . There 's all these snakes in this world , but not you . And it 's time , you know , you 're moving on , and I 'm happy for you , but I 'm just going through a shit period for me , and so I 'm just sad ... I 'm ... I 'm just sad that you 're leaving , that 's all . I 'm not going anywhere , Teddy . Me , neither , Teddy . Cheers , everyone . It 's a wedding . Have fun . What are you gon na do about it ? Thank you , cheers . Cheers , Teddy . Eat it up , boy . Your candor and brevity are always so much appreciated . I fucked that up . Um , so , um , let me keep this brief ' cause you all know how much I
zone3	just film this ? I 'm baring my soul here . You know , catch the moment . Here we go . Uh , do you know , when you spend a year in a tent in the African bush , you learn to appreciate the little things in life , like running water and the taste of a decent cheeseburger . You learn to appreciate being home around your friends , around your family , around the people who mean most to you in this unforgiving world . Zoe ... What ? I would be lying if I did n't say that loving you has been the great adventure of my life . And I make films in Africa . And coercing you into finally marrying me has been by far my greatest achievement . Other than that Oscar . I 'm joking ! I 'm joking ! - I am joking . - You 're not joking . - You 're dead serious . - I love you . I love you . Cheers , cheers , cheers . I toast to you , to old friends and
zone3	everyone at this ta ... - Uh-oh . - Cheers . Hi , everyone . Cheers . Cheers , Whit , Zoe . Cheers , everyone here . Um , well , I think I speak for Marshall and myself when I say that it 's a pleasure ... Who 's Marshall ? ... to ... to witness the pairing of two beautiful people . Two ... two dreamers , really , who are about to , uh ... embark on a journey of love and friendship . Um , it 's a rare thing to see two people who are so good-looking involved with each other . Um ... Anyway , uh , thank you , Whit , for letting us stay here . Uh , to new friends and to old friends . And , uh ... Whit ... You 're a lucky man . And , Zoe Whit 's a lucky man . If you 'll excuse me a moment . Sam , where are you going ? Oh , no , Sam , you 're gon na miss the birthday cake . Damn , just missed
zone3	you have a marvelous evening . Really . Does everyone have enough to drink ? Are you feeling all right ? You found me ! Oh . I 'm fine . I just think I got a bad case of food poisoning . So sweet of you to come out here and check up on me like this . Unbelievable , right ? You 'd think with all the money this guy has , he 'd serve some decent food in this joint . Are you drunk ? You know what ? That 's it . I drank on an empty stomach . You should never do that , Marshall . Come on . Let 's take a breath . How 'd you like my speech ? It 's a tough crowd out there . You and Zoe ... You never had , like , a-a thing , did you ? What does that mean ? What 's a thing ? I do n't know , it 's just , she kind of looks at you oddly , and you always breathe really funny whenever she 's around . And
zone3	just seems like there 's a lot of parallels . Right . Have you ever written anything , Marshall ? Just in my journal . Well , let me explain something to you , pal . Let me explain to you what us writers like to do . We make things up ... amalgams , okay ? And what are amalgams ? They 're things or characters based on other things or characters sort of all mixed together into one . Now , while Zoe up there and I are friends , and I do find her kind of interesting , she 's just a small part of a bigger whole . Tiny , insignificant part of that mermaid from my story . She 's a mixture of a lot of different girls that I know . Kind of like scrambled eggs . Does that make any sense ? No . I think I 'm having a hard time articulating what I 'm feeling right now . I think it 's fear . It 's not because I do n't trust you , because I do . I just ...
zone3	of my best-received stories was loosely based on the time that you and I tried to steal Cleopatra 's obelisk from Central Park . Remember that ? But I could n't use you and I in the story because we 're not interesting , so I had to replace us with bandits . Because bandits are far more interesting than normal people . That make sense ? I did n't know you wrote one about us . Did n't you get a signed copy in the mail ? Well , God damn it . Remind me , and I 'll resend you one . Come on . Let 's get back out there and loosen up a little bit . How 's my breath ? You should probably brush your teeth . Thank you for always being so honest with me . Okay . It looks like our lion friend has found a gazelle . I do n't know who I identify with most ... am I the predator , or am I the prey ? Being here , I see a pure way of living . America seems to
zone3	place that I never want to see again . All right , now , guys , this is just a rough cut , but I just thought that , since I had you all together in one place , I could get your notes and help raise a bit of awareness in the process . You know , and that 's why I 've got some questionnaires for everyone to fill out afterwards . Completely optional , of course . I just want to stay here and hold you forever . Who is that woman ? That 's my wife . So she is . Right . - Be right back . - Right , right . My friend the chief has just offered me 30 head of cattle . Lean , darling . You 're blocking the most brilliant ... ? hat 's a lot of cows . What the ... ? ! What the hell 's the matter with you ? ! Have you gone out of your mind ? ! Maybe . That stays on . I 've never been slapped before . That hurt , kind
zone3	n't mean to do it quite so hard . Well , you did . What happened to your mustache ? - I shaved it off . - Why ? ' Cause you told me to . What are you still doing here ? The whole reason I wrote you the postcard was to avoid this from happening . You know , well , maybe you should n't send postcards to people to notify them of heartbreaking news . What exactly is your objective ? It seems like I 'm in the process of winning you back . No ! I am getting married in two days . I am engaged . I 've always been engaged . I never thought you were actually gon na go through with it . What happened to our weekend in the city ? We were supposed to be alone together . What happened ? Whit thought it would be nice to just schedule our wedding while he already had everyone here for his birthday weekend . Hold on . Nothing about that statement seems odd to you ? Did n't you read anything I
zone3	you 're actually considering this guy as a serious option for you . He 's screening his movie at his wedding reception ? What kind of man are we dealing with here ? Shh ! You are being childish . So are you . Sam , please , save yourself the heartache and go home . No . No . If you refuse not to complicate my life , the least you can do is introduce yourself to one of my bridesmaids . I 'm sure they 're just as desperate as you to get their rocks off . I meant that in the least offensive way possible . And , Sam , stop standing on your toes . I like you the way you were . - Sammy ! - Hey , guys . Hey , how you feeling , pal ? I feel fine . Feel invigorated , actually . Let 's put a tiara on Sam . Thank you . You want some pills to go with that tiara , Princess ? - I 'd love some . - Yes , you do . We convinced this
zone3	marathon boy . My heart feels like it 's metal . It 's nice to see you loosening up a little bit there , pal . Do it , do it , do it ! - All right , I 'll show you , okay . But I want to see every one of you out there dancing later . Ready ? Come on . Ready ? Two , three , four . I 'll take one less than he 's had . Help yourself , man . On the house . Drink lots of water . It really helps . Does it make you forget about things or what ? They 'll bring you up , and they 'll take you down . Pow . See you next week , boy . ? ? Sept cent millions de chinois ? I feel amazing . I feel like my body 's being born again . Marshall , what the hell happened to your shoes ? I do n't know . I do n't know . Teddy took my shoes . I do n't know . I do n't know why
zone3	. Marshall , you 're breathing all over me . I know . ? ? C'est la vie , c'est la vie ? I actually ... I 've actually had a tapeworm . I have . Ask me how I got rid of it . How did you get rid of it ? I fasted for three days , and then I stuck a ham sandwich between my legs . So I did it for a week , I did this , and I still had the tapeworm , and it was causing a lot ... I wonder what the quickest way possible is to get another cigarette in my mouth . That 's the ticket . Ahoy , marshmallow ! - Oh . Hi . - Come here . - Your body is terrific . - I like your suit . You 're so sweaty . ? ? J'y pense et puis j'oublie ? ? C'est la vie , c'est la vie ? ? Trois cent millions de sovitiques ? Naughty . You 've been a naughty boy . - You 're bad . - I know . Ow
zone3	you hitting me ? Just touch me . Ow ! Stop it . ? ? C'est la vie , c'est la vie ? ? Cinquante millions de gens imparfaits ? ? Et moi , et moi , et moi ? ? Qui regardent Catherine Langeais ? ? ? la tlvision chez moi ? ? J'y pense et puis j'oublie ? ? C'est la vie , c'est la vie ? ? Neuf cent millions de crve la faim ? ? Et moi , et moi , et moi ? ? Avec mon rgime vgtarien ? ? Et tout le whisky que je m'envoi ? ? J'y pense et puis j'oublie ? - Hi . - Hi . You seem like trouble . I 'd like to get into some trouble . How old are you ? How old do I look ? I think I 'm a little old for you . Well , I may be young , but I was n't born yesterday . I do n't ... I do n't ... I do n't understand what you 're trying to say . Honestly , I took a pill
zone3	Quick , make-believe I said something really funny . Mmm . Funny . Why ? I do n't know . I-I like you . ? ? C'est la vie , c'est la vie ... ? ? ? Ah ... ? Come on . Try it . Oh ! You , uh ... you remind me of someone , and I really like it . It 's crazy out there , you know . It 's like , one minute you 're just walking down the street minding your own business , and then , all of a sudden , there 's a psychopath in a jumpsuit asking you for the time . And then I 'm waking up in a hospital bed in Lenox Hill with blood all over my sport coat . Mmm . What ? No , I mean it . You want to put your glasses on me ? Mm-hmm . - You find me attractive like that ? - Mm-hmm . Want to make out ? Okay . Really ? ? ? Oh , darling ? ? Make it go ? ? Make it go away
zone3	it 'd be time for us to kiss now . Hello , darling . Bedtime . Oh , no , we were in the middle of a conversation . Hey . Uh ... oh , hi . Have you guys seen my shoes ? I have ... I have these loafers . They 're ... Uh ... Okay , uh ... Hi . Hey . Um , do you have ... ? Uh , do you know where I can find my shoes ? Teddy , Teddy , I need my shoes . Pow , pow , pow . Your shoes are mine , boy ! Okay . Uh ... my room is this way . Oh , hello . Is this where you dwell ? Okay , it 's hot . Oh , that 's better . - Am I gon na die ? - No , pal . Here , have some cheese plate . It 'll slow your heart down . Come on . Get some food in your little tummy . So , how 'd it go with your lady ? Who , Margaret ? Went
zone3	back-to-back . - In a row ? - Mm-hmm . What 's it like ... to screw on pills ? What do you say you and I forget about the pills from now on , huh ? We do n't need them . How 'd it go with your girl ? Not that good . I walked in on the blond maid in the closet crying . And Esme ... she 's got , like , some sort of husband or something , apparently . Do n't you worry , pal . You reacted perfectly . You 're so much better than her , it kills me . You kill me . Why do you think she 's with him ? Esme ? I do n't really know that much about her . No , I mean Zoe and Whit . Why do you think she 's with him ? Oh . I bet it has something to do with her father . My therapist says that a lot of things have to do with your father . Marshall , you 're so goddamn intuitive . I 'm sure it
zone3	I mean , it 's probably damaged her judgment in some way . And also , she just seems like the type of girl who , you know , likes to be taken care of , and Whit clearly does that . He 's a really good-looking guy , successful , tall . - Really ? - Yeah . What , you think he 's handsome ? Yeah . Marshall , your penis looks tremendous right now . What ? You have a tremendous penis , Marshall ! Hello ? Hi . Um ... I could n't sleep . I need you to take a bath . There 's no hot water . Hey . Pretend like it 's a swimming pool . Take the cheese plate . - Hey . - Hi . Was n't really expecting company . The place is a bit of a pigsty . Marshall is a bit of a slob . Is he gon na be okay in there ? Yeah , he 's fine . Marshall loves baths . He 's my little son . He 's my sidekick . He was having
zone3	telling her something about how he got pistol-whipped . Yeah . I am staying in my sleeping bag , so do n't get any ideas . You and Margaret seemed to really hit it off . Hmm ? How 'd it work out for the two of you ? She was very responsive . Oh . Well , she better be . She 's had a lot of practice . Yeah , she knew what she was doing . You sound awfully jealous for a woman who 's about to get married . What 's the deal , man ? What 's that ? Is this a new one ? Why did n't you send it to me ? Because I 'm still workshopping it . " Chloe the Mermaid , " huh ? I can give you a brief synopsis if you 'd like . Would you like that ? - I would . - Okay . Well , it 's about a young deep-sea diver who 's , uh , searching for pearls on the bottom of the ocean floor . Anyway , our hero falls in love
zone3	vapid relationship with a megalomaniacal , arguably gay merman ... you know , complete sociopath . The diver has to battle the merman for the mermaid 's heart . And , uh , there 's a big fight scene at the end . Not really sure how it all works out . It 's better than the one about the flying koala bear . Yeah . That 's one of my worst one's . What do you got there ? What 's with the legal pad and pencil ? Well , they 're supposed to be my vows , but they 're all blank . I have to write them , but I 'm having some trouble . Uh-huh . I kind of need a writer 's opinion . Did you come all the way in here for me to work on your vows ? Can you ? Where do we start ? That 's where you come in . Wow . You 're making a real dent , I see . Okay . Well , um ... I do n't know . What ... what do you like about
zone3	be himself . That 's for sure . Uh-huh . Yeah , I can see that . For sure . Okay . Let 's write that down . He makes me feel safe and secure . Mm-hmm . Takes care of me . - He 's handsome ... - Okay . - Successful . - Okay . This is all great , by the way . What else ? He 's very strong-willed . Strong-willed ... good word . These are really good . I mean , not afraid to be himself ... clearly . I mean , anybody who dances like that ca n't possibly be self-conscious . Just completely uninhibited . I 've never seen a man dance like that before ... without him being a woman . This is not gon na help . All right , maybe not right for the vows . I 'm just trying to be objective here . And , I mean , honestly , as far as being safe and secure , look . How can you not feel safe and secure with a guy like that ? I mean ,
zone3	a turtleneck in Africa . I like it . Oh , it 's too hot in here for this . And as far as being strong-willed goes , that 's great for you , because you could just turn off for the next 50 years , like a little robot ... be taken care of . Is n't that what you want ? Now you 're just being an ass , Sam . Yes , I am . I 'm winning you back , goddamn it . I missed you . I know . That 's why I came . I could feel it . Just shut up . Yeah , you know , if you could just be gone in the morning before I wake up , that would make things so much easier for me . Well , who said I was trying to make things easy for you ? You never stop talking , do you ? No , I do n't . Okay . ? ? If I 'm so lost without a friend ? ? Tell me , who 's this by my side ?
zone3	? What are you doing ? You looked so peaceful , I was gon na let you sleep more . Boy . We had a crazy night , did n't we , old sport ? Well , what happened with Zoe last night ? What about it ? I mean , why was she in your room instead of with her soon-to-be husband ? You want to know the truth , Marshall ? Yeah . I want to know the truth . To make a long story short , she 's not sure she wants to marry this asshole after all . Seriously ? Seriously . She 's saying she 's thinking about calling off the whole frickin ' wedding . God , she 's a very complicated woman , Marshall . Yeah , it seems that way . Buddy , I know this is the last thing you need . I would not have ever come down here in the first place if I knew she was gon na go nuts on me like this . That 's okay . At least we can leave now , right ?
zone3	to stay here until she figures this whole thing out . I 'm all she has . She 's all alone in the world . You know , who 's she gon na talk to ... Uncle Teddy ? In the meantime , why do n't you go take a power nap ? I 'll go downstairs and have them whip you up some eggs . Still like your yolks cut out ? You look like a little prince right now , by the way . I love you . ? ? La , la , la , la , la , la , lies ? ? You ca n't repeat what you put ' round ? ? All the things that made me cry ? Hey there . Um , good morning . Who would I speak to about getting some ... getting maybe getting some eggs ? Um ... one minute . Oh ! ? ? I 've got my girl and together we 're strong ? ? Strong ? ? To laugh at you and prove you wrong ? ? ? I do n't insist that you
zone3	smile ? ? Do n't ever think you ... ? Morning , gang ! Is this the cool section ? Hi . Is it morning already ? Wow . It just sneaks up on you . You sleep at all , pal ? Perfect amount . How about you ? No , not one bit . I 've been working on this all night . Check it out . It 's a cock . I know , Teddy . How exactly do you know this Sam character , anyway ? It all seems a bit mysterious . I-I was in New York . I bumped into him . He 's a writer . He sends me his stories , and ... I give him notes . Gives me something to do . You totally fucked him , did n't you ? He 's a bit young , dear . No . No , we 're friends . We 're pen pals . If you want to know how the sex is , I think you got to ask Margaret . Hmm ? - Shut up . - What ? You
zone3	, tell us . Was he any good ? Well , if ... if holding him while he wept because some girl broke his heart is good , then , um ... yeah , it was great . Best I 've ever had . Wow . Yeah , he 's , um ... he 's an intense young man . Very emotional . - Hi , girls . Good morning . - Good morning . - Morning . - Still here , are we ? Good morning . I made you a little present . Here . If I would 've known you were getting married , I would 've gotten you something like a blender or a set of knives , but that 'll do . Look , Zo , it 's got your name on it . Yeah , it does . Thank you . - Hey , there . - Hmm ? We had a fun night last night , did n't we ? We did . How are you feeling ? Better , thanks . Seriously , who are you , and why are you here
zone3	breakfast , you snakes in the grass ? If you 're gon na film me waking up in the morning , you should wake up before me . It 's not brain science . Discuss it with Spider . I 'm done . God , look at this table of gorgeous ladies . - Morning , darling . - Lady of the house . Big Sam . Hey , morning , Teddy . You look rested . I made this for your wedding . It 's your portrait . It 's a big skinny penis with balls . I spent a lot of time on it . Nice shorts , pal . - Oh , that 's funny . - Oh ... I think he likes me . Finally . Where were you last night ? Oh , I could n't sleep . I worked on my vows . Come here . What is that hideous thing around your neck ? It 's a wedding present from Sam . Look . Is n't that pretty ? Yours is in the mail , slick . Sam . Why do n't you
zone3	? Looks like Teddy blew off all the fireworks last night , and we need some more for the reception . Come on . It 'll be fun . Okay . - Do n't go . - Yep . Have fun . Give it to me . Right here , right here . Hi . You okay ? Hey ! You know , Zoe left one of your stories lying around the house , and I finally had a chance to read it ... the one about the koala bear in the Central Park Zoo . Really ? Why would you do that ? You know , Sam , you 're not half bad . Your writing has a lot of character . I will say , though , that that adorable koala bear got kind of annoying , with the whingeing and the moaning , and I 'm not sure it 's a good story for children . Well , you 're not exactly my target demo , but I take that as a compliment . Are you as much a romantic in your real life as you are
zone3	myself a realist , more concerned with the human condition . I 'm sure you can tell that from my body of work . It 's ... It 's a bit lbsenesque , I suppose . Anyway , I admire that quality in your writing . Although I 've never really been much of a reader . All Zoe does is read . All day , all night , she 'll read anything you put in front of her . It 's quite sweet , really . It 's why ... it 's why she likes someone like you . Because I 'm working so much of the time , it 's difficult for me to cater to all of Zoe 's interests . That 's our Zoe , is n't it ? She 's mad ! She decides she wants to learn tennis , she learns tennis ! She goes to all the matches , practices every day , she develops a nice backhand . Her goddamn instructor moved in with us one summer . And then one day , she decides tennis is a dull sport , a
zone3	to do with it . Last summer , it was dragonflies . She was obsessed with the things . Studied them , painted them , took courses on them , and then one day , poof . No more dragonflies . Yeah , I did n't even know she liked dragonflies . Well , she does n't , Sam . Not anymore . It 's okay , just hold still . All done . Sam tell you a lot about me ? Well , I mean , Sam and I are pretty much brothers , so ... he tells me practically everything . I hope not . You know , I 'm not sure that Sam ever told me the whole story of how you two met . Uh , I was , um ... I was in New York with Whit , the premiere of his film . I think it was " A Tale of Two Villages . " And we got into a terrible fight at the Ziegfeld , and I stormed out of the theater into the pouring rain . I was a mess . And
zone3	and it was Sam , without an umbrella holding a copy of The New York Observer over my head . Guess it must have been a Wednesday . I guess so . We spent the entire night together . When it came time to say our good-byes ... he asked me to be his pen pal . Sure enough , two weeks later , I receive this epic 10-page letter from Sam . And I made the mistake of writing him back . Sorry . What am I talking about ? So , what was the plan ? He was gon na ... come all the way out here and propose to me in front of everyone ? I-I do n't know . That is so stupid . I guess that 's why he brought the ring , right ? He brought a ring ? Zoe left me once . Did you know that ? No . I had no idea . Of course you did n't . No one does . She 's very good at keeping secrets , is n't she ? Yeah , apparently . Who was
zone3	tambourine or something . What did you do ? I let her leave . Now , what would you have done , Sam , if you were me ? If I were you I 'd have gone after her . I guess I just do n't feel the need to chase girls around the schoolyard anymore . She came back , did n't she ? Of course she did . She always does . Well , do you want to get back and get those fireworks , or ... ? Huh ? Oh , do n't worry about that . I 'll send an intern or something . Tell me , Sam , have you ever had a lime Rickey ? All right , all right , line up , you gorgeous people . Every year for my birthday , we throw a paper chase . You all know the rules . First team to gather up as many little pieces of paper as you can wins the race , and you get to kiss a pretty girl . And you all stand a chance this year , ' cause
zone3	back in the bush . All right , may the best team win . You promised me we were leaving . I already packed up the car . We are gon na leave , just as soon as we win this race , or whatever the hell it is . Sam , I ca n't participate in a three-legged race when my foot is like this . What happened to your foot ? I stepped on a martini glass . Well , why would you do that ? Conditions are rough this year , but thanks for playing . It keeps it fun . All right , someone take this . All right , Zoe , let 's get this going . We need to hit a rhythm , Marshall . I ca n't hit a rhythm when my foot is bleeding , Sam . Come on , as many as you can . Here , put them all in the basket . Everything you get , put in the basket . Come on , Marshall , keep up with me . We got to beat Whit and his African
zone3	Ca n't run with the big dogs and piss with the puppies . It looks like we 're doing all right . Come on , hurry up ! I do n't understand the point of this game . No , I do n't either , dear . Never mind , eh ? Come on , Whit ! Here we go , just get all the little papers you can get . Thank you . If you could please leave our area , Whit ! Babe , I think I 'm winning ! This is the stupidest game I 've ever seen . Quit trying to be quick when my foot is bleeding . This is our area right here . - Ow ! - Marshall ! I do n't even get what the point of this game is ! Marshall , I have no idea what the point of the game is , but I think we 're in the lead by half a basket . - You 're a liar . - Oh , Marshall , pick up your skirt . - Wait , what ? - You 're
zone3	? The only reason we went on this vacation is ' cause you 're completely in love with that lady . - Admit it ! - Marshall , shh ! - Zoe told me everything herself . - Shh , shh ! - You lied to her about the postcard . - Okay , okay . And you lied to me about wanting to be a good friend . Marshall , okay , I understand how this may seem , and you 're right , I have n't been completely honest with you , but you got to understand , it 's very complicated right now . Whit ... Whit just told me that Zoe left him once . She left him once , and she 'll leave him again , okay ? The man is threatened by me , I can tell . Look at him , he 's practically running scared . I love this game ! I 'm a machine ! Marshall , this man is playing mind games with me . I am at war with this man right now , okay ? You can not
zone3	same team , pal . No , we 're not . We were never on the same team . You just gaslighted me because you knew that no one else would ever be a part of this . - Shh ! - And because I have a car . And now I have a martini glass in my foot , and you have yet to apologize ! Marshall , Jesus Christ , what are you doing with your knife ? Marshall , do n't quit . Marshall , that 's your birthday present . What are you doing ? No , it 's not . It 's Noah Bressman 's . Okay , pal . Do n't worry , I 'm gon na win this goddamn race for you , okay ? Take care of that foot . I 'll meet you back later . I 'm getting my shoes back , okay ? Oh , God , yeah , look at all this . ? ? It do n't come easy ? Come on , Sam , you ca n't play alone ! You 're up for disqualification !
zone3	Here we go . ? ? You know it do n't come easy ? Game 's not over yet , Marshall ! Come on , mate ! ? ? Got to pay your dues if you want to sing the blues ? ? And you know it do n't come easy ? ? You do n't have to shout or leap about ? ? You can even play them easy ? ? Forget about ... ? Hi , Marshmallow . Your foot is bleeding . Yeah . Um , do you know where Teddy is ? I need to find him so I can get my shoes . Oh , well , you can sit here with us . We 're just ... we 're putting shells in the colander . No , that 's okay , I think I 'd like to find Teddy so I can get my shoes and get out of here . Okay , well , he was right over there . He went to go find dolphins . Okay , uh ... I do n't see him anywhere . You sure you do n't
zone3	set of paws . No . ? ? Open up your heart ? ? Come together ? Hey ! Hey ! Get some help ! Teddy ! Teddy ! I got you ! I got you ! I got him ! Help ! Help ! Teddy ! Teddy , wake up ! Teddy ! Help ! Teddy ! All right , Marshall , stand aside ! We 've got it ! Teddy ! Help him ! Help him ! - Get him up ! Get him up ! - He 's not breathing ! Give him some space ! Back off ! I saved him . I saved his life . - What are you staring at ? ! - Breathe for me , Teddy . Call an ambulance ! Teddy ! - Come on , Teddy , please ! - One , two , three , four . Teddy ! Come on , Teddy ! Teddy , please ! Please , Teddy ! Not today . - Come on , Teddy , come on . - Teddy ! Yeah , mate , get it all out . Spit it
zone3	that 's it . Turn him over . Teddy ! All right , everyone , he 's all right , he 's all right . Did I go under ? That 's our man . He 's all right . Yes ! Yes ! You ca n't do that ! - Let 's go , eh ? - I 'm okay . Come on , love , let me take care of him . - All right , let 's go . - God damn you , Teddy ! Up , up , up , up , up . I did it , everybody ! I did it ! I 'm alive ! Thank you all for your help . You 've all been real stars . Drama 's over . Are you okay ? Stop it , Sam ! Are you mad at me ? It 's not about you , Sam . It 's all right . It 's all right . It 's gon na be all right . Come on , love . Come on , my love . I 'm sorry . It 's all
zone3	I 'm sorry . It 's all right . No , no , no , Marshall , you ca n't leave ! I need you here ! I am going home . These people ... these are bad people , Sam . They 're irresponsible . They 're like ... they 're like babies with money . Marshall , I apologize that I made you do the paper chase with your bad foot , but I honestly thought we had a shot at winning the thing . We never had a shot , Sam , and I-I ca n't just stand by and watch you do this to yourself anymore . I 'm not gon na be a supporting character in your pathetic little story . It 's unoriginal . You are not Holden Crawford . All right , first of all , it 's Holden ... Marshall , please , do n't use metaphors with me right now . Please , okay ? You ... you are a bad man . You are . You 're a bad person . You came here to ruin a poor woman 's
zone3	your former best friend in the process . Oh , my God , Marshall ! And you had no right to do that ! You had no right ! Marshall , shut up ! Shut up ! I am sick and tired of hearing about your misfortune . And the way you decide to divulge this information to anybody who 's willing to listen ... it 's depressing . What is that supposed to mean ? Marshall , you got pistol-whipped ... once . I 'm sorry it happened , and it 's a shame , but it happens to somebody new every day , and they move on with their lives . You complain ! I was assaulted ! A man came at me from behind with a gun and beat me , and then stole all of my money ! That 's what I mean ... it 's always a new excuse to not move out of your parents ' house , to not get a new job . Marshall , do n't you realize you should be thanking me right now ? I took you on an
zone3	you ? I do n't care . You have nothing to offer them , Sam ! You 're just a mistress ! And if you had just come to me and told me your feelings , I would 've listened to you , and I would 've told you you were a fool . But , instead , you decided to use and to lie to me . And that 's just sick and disgusting ! I 'm your best friend ! Oh . And this , Sam . You think this is really gon na impress her ? Give that back . You 're young , you 're poor , and , honestly , you 're a shitty writer . Yeah ? I used to look up to you . Marshall , you 're a year and a half older than me . Shut up . My God , Sam , what happened to your face ? I fell down the stairs . We should have the paramedics take a look at you if they 're still here . Your nose looks crooked . No , it 's fine
zone3	, come on . - All right . - Thanks . So the gents are off to the woods for the night . It 's a 200-year-old tradition for the men in my family to sleep under the stars before a wedding . - Oh . - You should come . Oh , no . That ... that sounds great , Whit . I think I 'm just gon na stay here and hold down the fort . Come on . I 'll let you shoot my gun . Yeah , I 'd love to shoot your gun , trust me , but I 'm just gon na keep it close , battle the elements here . So Big Sam has bravely offered to stay back and look after our women . Let 's go , men . ? ? Up spoke the captain of our gallant ship ? ? And a fine old man was he ? I 'm pretty sure he does n't even think you 're that funny , which I happen to find to be one of your best qualities . The man also admitted to
zone3	know you think I 'm young and irrational , and I am in some ways , but at least I appreciate you for your best qualities . You know , I-I made some terrible mistakes , and I probably alienated the majority of people who were close to me , but I did that because I love you . And that 's what love is , is n't it ? You could just give me a chance . At least where we could live together for an extended period of time , where I could make some money and buy you things , and we could develop hobbies together . I could very easily spend the rest of my life with you . And I know you feel the same way . I could be the father of your children . I should be the father of your children . There should be half of me in your children . Who are you talking to , Sam ? It 's 6:00 in the morning . Oh . I was talking to you . How long were you , uh ...
zone3	want to marry me ? I never had a chance to thank Marshall for saving Teddy 's life . Will you tell him for me when you see him ? I do n't think we 'll be seeing each other for quite a while . Did I cause all this ? No . I mean , yes . Technically , it is your fault . But I think I 'm mostly to blame , you know . I 'm sorry I snapped at you earlier on the beach . I was just a little emotional . I 'm sorry for being so insensitive about your brother almost dying . Did you and Whit have a nice buggy ride ? Whit told me you used to like dragonflies . I never knew that about you . I loved them . That was just a phase . Everyone has phases . I do n't . When I love something , I stick with it . - I 'm a very convicted person . - Hmm . I do n't just throw things away whenever I lose interest . That 's a very
zone3	n't have to marry this guy , Zoe . I 'm too tall for you , Sam . I 'm serious . Do n't put yourself through this . You do n't understand . I do n't ... I want to . I do n't believe you . If you wanted to , you would 've done it already . - There 's a very good ... - I 'm asking you ... You have n't even written your vows yet . Please , do n't make this harder than it already is ! Wh-why do you want to marry Whit ? Give me one good reason ... I 'll leave . It 's not that easy . Well , it should be ! You used to tell me you did n't even believe in marriage . Things change . People grow up . - I 've grown up . - Oh , you 've grown up ? Sneaking into my room in the middle of the night barefoot ? You ... go ahead . I 'm gon na ruin your wedding in front of everyone , that 's it
zone3	will tell Whit every single thing about us from the night in the rain until the ... Whit knows . What does that mean ? Whit knows . He 's always known . H-how ? Because he 's not an idiot . I do n't ... I do n't ... I do n't understand . Why ... why would he let me stay here ? Because he loves me . He trusts me . Because you 're not a real threat , Sam . I am in love with you , and you love me ! And that 's it ! This is love ! That 's not love ! That is bullshit ! Right ? Answer me . Are you in love with me , or am I just dragonflies ? So that 's it , then ? I 'm just a phase ? I know all about your tambourine player . So you just love everyone , huh ? You just flit around and love everything without consequence ? Wow , that 's a big problem , Zoe ! And Whit lets you get away with it ?
zone3	this ending ? Quick , Sam . Tell me your amazing plan . What 's our move ? Should I go upstairs and pack a suitcase , jump into your friend 's station wagon and run away with you to a one-bedroom apartment ? I 'm sure you can provide for the little one's and me with all the money you 've made from your wildly successful children 's stories .

Look at me , buddy . I 'm really sorry that I have n't called you back in a year . I 've been a bit of an absentee best friend . You 're an asshole , Sam . I know . You 've been a terrible and a cruel friend to me . And you said things over these past few days that I do n't think you can ever take back . I know that . And you 've taken a lot of my money . Marshall ... I know . And I 'm sorry

In a completely unrelated story twenty-two percent of Americans indicate a preference for getting ****** in the *** with a red-hot poker . Tough times require a tough man . And the tougher times get the more the voters will realize they need me
zone3	the problems we face is that of aliens and so-called superheroes who act on their own as judge , jury , and often , executioner . No one is above the law . I learned that for myself many years ago . And now this principle will be the driving force of my presidency . I have already taken steps to bring some of these superhumans into the service of our government where their unique powers will be utilized for the benefit of all Americans . They are Captain Atom Black Lightning Power Girl Katana , and Major Force . I hope that in the months to come many more will voluntarily make the choice they 've made . And if they do n't , they will find that they are not as far above the law as they think . This started with a routine traffic stop an hour ago . The driver brandished a gun at police , and ... Whoa ! That was close . This man 's car has close to 600 horsepower and can go almost 200 miles an hour . That 's faster than
zone3	a hard time keeping up w ... Wait a minute . So this is what you 've been up to these last few months . Chasing cars . I help wherever I 'm needed . But you have n't been needed much lately , have you ? - What do you want ? - We want you to admit something . I 'll shoot myself , I swear ! Just a minute . I 'm gon na ... Ah ! - Come on , you . - Out of the car . Now , what am I supposed to admit ? That Luthor has n't done a bad job . Told you this would be a waste of time . Luthor did the one thing nobody was expecting . He made things boring again . And boring is good , is n't it ? The economy is back to normal . Crime is down . There are no wars or anything . He 's up to something . Ca n't anybody see that ? That 's what I thought at first . Eventually , I realized all he 's trying
zone3	such a good job no one will have a choice but to respect him . It 's all about ego now . I 'll never respect him . He 's a sick man . He 's not the first to sit in the Oval Office . He 's right . There have been womanizers , drunks , crooks but Nixon helped turn our worst enemy into our best trading partner . And Johnson gave us the Voting Rights Act . Thanks for the history lesson , but I 'm not buying it . Come on , work with us . Please ? We need you . Sorry . I guess Luthor 's not the only one with an ego . Is the spectrographic analysis complete yet ? Yes , sir . And the new data confirms our original analysis . The meteor is pure kryptonite . A chunk of Krypton the size of a small country . That planet 's been an endless source of grief for me . The new numbers also indicate our original estimate of time of impact was right . Seven days . Correction . There
zone3	the plan ? Missiles . We 've never shot down anything that big before . The missiles will work . When I first heard about this , I started doing the calculations myself . You 're brooding , Amanda . I 'm just thinking we have all sorts of other firepower . You mean those so-called superheroes ? They do work for you now . Most of them , anyway . That 's to keep them from working against me . I 'm not going to put the fate of this planet in the hands of ... Of freaks and monsters . - That 's not why you wo n't use them . No ? You want all the credit for yourself . Careful . Try thinking of it this way : If you do n't reach out to some of those freaks and monsters there might not be a planet left to feed that massive ego of yours . Now , if you have nothing else for me ... Ms . Waller . Thank you for your honesty . And I want to assure all Americans and all the
zone3	meteor with the efficiency that characterized my previous endeavors . But , as a precaution , I 'd like to meet with Superman as soon as possible . It 's time to bury our rivalry once and for all and work together for the good of mankind . This is one time he 's not lying . About burying the rivalry ? - I do n't think so . No . About the meteor . I 've been following it the last few days with my own instruments . I could go up there in a lead suit and smash the thing . There 's no amount of lead that could keep out so much radiation . And it would n't stand up to all that smashing either . Got anything better ? I 'm working on something with one of my contacts . You 're going to go and meet with him , are n't you ? You know me too well . I ca n't just stand back and do nothing . Well , when it all goes south , do n't count on me to save you
zone3	too . Well ? Somehow , I knew that would be the first word out of your mouth . When the meteor gets close enough , I 'm sending up a dozen missiles . Each one is going to have a 50-megaton warhead . What do you want from me ? Some of my people do n't have as much confidence in this plan as I do . They think I need a backup . With the whole world at stake , that 's not a bad idea . Does that mean you 're willing to work for me ? - For you ? - Yes . You 'll be working for me . But only insofar as I represent the country that adopted you . And that you love . What 's wrong ? Was I getting too sentimental ? Luthor . You think I 'd be crazy enough to meet you without some kind of protection ? - Metallo . - Who else could stand up to you ? Should n't have done that . He 's the president . - That 's not gon na hold him
zone3	you have to get out of here . Superman . From me to you . What was that explosion ? Plastique ? - Something like that . - It wo n't stop him . - He 's going to reconfigure . - Do n't worry about that now . The kryptonite is near your heart . I do n't know if I 'll get it before the wound closes . Where 's The Flash when you need him ? Do me a favor and lose the sense of humor . Do us both a favor and buy one . We ca n't go back up . He might still be there . Neither of us is in any shape to take him on . Then what are we supposed to do ? The cemetery was built over the old sewer system . But how can we ... ? - Are you up to it ? - We 'll find out , wo n't we ? Oh , it 's you . Bruce . It 's not ending here . I wo n't let it . I thought I was supposed
zone3	that . Can we get to your cave from here ? Eventually . Time for you to see my side of the world . Some company you keep . Come on , Bruce . Stay with me . You know who I was thinking about the other day ? Who ? - Magpie . The criminal ? - Do we know another Magpie ? Whatever happened to her ? - She died . - No . Are you sure ? Reasonably . Why is it that good villains never die ? Clark , what the hell are good villains ? - Can you do it ? - Sure . Bend steel and all that . Clark . It tickles . Halt . Identify yourselves . Alfred , it 's me . - Master Bruce . You can rest easy , sir . I 'm already feeling better . Thanks . I took the liberty of washing and repairing your shirt and cape . The souvenirs of the Gotham City sewers are best left under the streets . I 'm sure Lois will appreciate that . - Honor and distinction .
zone3	he was still human . A human being who certainly did n't deserve this . He came to me months ago , seeking a pardon and a fresh start and , mindful of my own history as well as his enormous potential for good I granted him both . In the short time Mr . Corben had left , he worked hard for this country helping to keep her secure from terrorist threats . Then , last night , John Corben was murdered . Murdered , our prosecutors believe by a man who used his own freakish power to settle a personal score in violation of the laws that bind us all . A man who calls himself Superman . Does he think anybody 's gon na believe that ? I met with Superman to try to enlist him in the government 's effort to stop the meteor . He , of all people , should have been eager to help . But instead , he lost his temper . Metallo stepped in to protect me . And this is what Superman did to him . I know many of
zone3	do this . I shared that skepticism until some of our top scientists reminded me that Superman 's vulnerability to kryptonite can have a psychological component . In other words , the radiation from the approaching meteor is affecting Superman 's mind . He 's a danger to us all now . And himself as well . In accordance with that I am announcing a bounty on him in the amount of one billion dollars . It pains me to do this but as our planet faces its gravest peril we can not afford to be distracted by one man 's growing irrationality . Thank you and good night . And we 're out . Thank you , Mr . President . Let 's go , people . Come in . Mr . President , can I talk to you ? It 's really important . " Growing irrationality " ? - Who does he think ... ? - Can it affect your mind ? No . I mean , it never has . Look , this whole thing is just plain ridiculous . - I can prove I did
zone3	me the whole time , and ... - Oh . - I 'll figure out a way to clear this up later . Right now , you and I have a meteor to stop . He did n't do it . I 'm sure of it . Oh , really ? It 's just not in him . Do me a favor . Think back to three years ago . Could you have even dreamed back then that I would be president today ? Did you think it was in me ? Then if I could change that much , could n't he ? You 're late . What took you ? I honestly do n't think you 'd understand . - Lois ? - Mm-hm . You 're right . You know , you did n't need to use the wire . - I could have carried you . - Between you and me , I hate that . This wo n't take long . - See something ? - Smell something . Now even I can smell it . They must think I did this with my heat
zone3	heat vision is radioactive . It 's not , is it ? No . This way . - Now I really do look like a criminal . - It 's done wonders for me . But how do we get the data now ? There 's one other possibility . Okay , where 's your friend ? Yeah . The one who 's worth a billion bucks . You wan na play it that way ? Okay . Superman . - Little busy at the moment . When you can , bring the heat . Now ! - You all right ? - Better than them , anyway . Banshee 's out . Can you keep her that way ? Hypersonics . Effective even on metahumans . If she tries anything this will drive her scream right back at her . - More ? - Everyone wants that reward . All you are is a rat with wings . And what better way to get rid of a rat than by drowning it ? There . That was n't too difficult . I 'll have to ask the Joker why

Grundy not feel good . Grundy gon na feel a lot worse . Shiva . You wan na be Luthor 's boy now ? I 'm sick of Lex Luthor . Mongul was n't his usual talkative self . And Grundy sounded like William F . Buckley . You think there 's some kind of mind control going on ? A telepath , or maybe a ... ? - Nightshade . Interesting . Even the lesser one's have some value when their powers are put to the proper use . I know that speech pattern . Top of that building . Grodd . Of course . Had to be a telepath . Heard a gorilla 's heartbeat . Pull . Hey . What ... ? We 're surrounded . I can hear them coming . I suppose it 's useless to tell you to leave . I would n't

Are you all right , Mr . President ? Fine . But thank you for asking . At ease , at ease . Let 's see those missiles , general . You sold out to Luthor . I 'm doing my duty . Look , this is n't my decision to make . It 's the court 's . " Court 's " ? This is Luthor 's vendetta . Power Girl , what do you think about all this ? It does n't matter what any of us thinks . Luthor is the president and what he says goes . Now , are you coming or not ? Not . You piece of ... Look out ! Enough . Some of our scientists were going over the scenario in their computers . They do n't think the missiles will be enough to ... General , I do n't care what
zone3	meteor . - I did all the calculations myself . - Yes , sir . Captain Atom . This is n't the best time . I 'm sorry , sir , but you wanted to be kept apprised . Yes . Fine . Do you have them in custody ? - No , sir . - What happened ? - We lost Power Girl . - She 's dead ? - We 're not sure . She ... - Captain Atom I have three words for you : Finish your job . Superheroes . It 's not gon na be any easier without Power Girl . We should have killed them . We do not kill people . Understand ? Is that right ? - You all right ? - Uh-huh . - What made you do that ? - Warn you ? It just sort of came out . - You do n't think I killed Metallo , do you ? - Do n't know . Luthor says you did . Tell me something , Power Girl . Now that you 've been up close and personal with Luthor
zone3	the president . But how do you feel when you 're around him ? He ... He makes my skin crawl . Sometimes you have to trust your instincts . But how do you know when ? Now . - See ? She 's a traitor . - Is that true ? - It 's complicated . - No , it isn't . - Tell me something . - What do you want , dirtbag ? Did Metallo say anything before he died ? Was he surprised to see you ? I do n't know what you 're talking about . What did Luthor promise you ? - Money ? What do I need with money ? I 'm living energy . You 're not going to tell me you killed him for your country , are you ? Some of us still believe in putting our country first . Sorry , but I do n't see any patriotism here . All I see is a psycho who 's latched onto an excuse to kill people and who 's so stupid he does n't realize he 's being used by

I can absorb it . - Captain , I ca n't let you ... - I was watching . And listening . This is the least I can do . Let 's do this . Five , four , three , two , one . Liftoff . And they 're on their way . Wormhole generator engaged . Closing on target . Do n't worry . I 'm not going to say " I told you so . " Good thing . General , what the hell happened ? You ... We did n't take into account all that radiation . It detonated the warheads before they hit . So the meteor is ... Still on course . Well , this is it . Luthor 's got his own office in there . This has to be where he 's keeping the information . And by now ,
zone3	's radiation level . - So how do we get in ? - Do n't worry . We 've got it worked out . But you need to be somewhere else right now . - Yeah , but ... - Go . They 're bound to have all kinds of radar . We should go the rest of the way on foot . We do have something worked out , do n't we ? No . But I 'm sure it 'll come to me . It does n't take the wisdom of Solomon to know you should stay down . Tell me something , Captain Marvel . Would Solomon have gone to work for Lex Luthor ? Batman , do n't make this any more difficult than it has to be . You wan na play it that way ? Fine . You know , you 've never been any good against magic . And magic 's what I 'm all about . - Superman . Castling . - Good call . Captain Marvel ? Hawkman , before you black out I want you to know I wish it
zone3	black out ? Are you all right ? Say something . Shazam . This initial attempt was planned from the start only as a research mission . Now that I have the data I need about the meteor I 'll be able to put the second phase of my plan into operation . I want to assure you that I will deal with this promptly and effectively . You have nothing to fear , so , please , continue your work your play , your travel , your shopping and everything else you normally do . Thank you , and may God ... I 'm sorry , no one 's allowed ... Mr . President , the whole country 's in a state of panic and they 're ready to take you out behind a barn and ... What are you ... ? Just taking my supplements , that 's all . Supplements ? A little steroidal cocktail for strength , and some liquid kryptonite for ... Well , just in case . How long ... ? Since the last week of the campaign . It 's given me boundless
zone3	What about the meteor ? - The meteor 's going to hit . It does n't have to . There are other ways . - That boy in Japan . - I know all about him . - I wo n't be needing him . - But ... Do n't worry , Amanda , everything 's going to be fine . - " Fine " ? - I 've come to realize that this meteor is a gift from the heavens . It 's going to scourge the earth of millions , maybe billions of people the planet could n't sustain anyway . The world that will spring from the ashes will be a better one . Rational , orderly . And you know how I know that ? Because I 'm going to build that world . And , of course , I intend for you to play a role in all this . A very important role . Mr . President , Hawkman and Captain Marvel are here . We 'll talk more later . Captain Marvel . Hawkman . This is a surprise . You would n't

Feeling a little green at the gills ? Well , well , a bat by any other name ... He said hurry , Luthor . All right , all right . I 'll tell you where it is . - Computer . Yes , Mr . President ? Delete all files immediately . Deleting . Deleting . Deleting . - No ! All files deleted . Aw . You two are n't going to be able to save the world now . Well , I 'll tell you something . Everyone who lives see the new world will have learned never to trust your kind again . Shut up . Here . It 's got all the information you need on it . Now go save us . Bitch . General , arrest him .

Uh , Toyman , can we please see the rocket now ? Sure , sure . I did n't have a lot of time so I based it on a design I whipped up when I was 7 . That 's why it has manual controls even though it 's not going to need a pilot . Oh , one other thing . Back when I designed it , I was way into hero worship . You are absolutely sure this is going to work ? Does Power Girl have big ... ? - Just feed it the numbers , kid . You got it . Wow . Who 's there ? Is n't there any way to speed this up , Toyman ? Sure , go find some other kid with a 210 IQ . And good luck with that . Hello , sunshine . Keep going .

How am I gon na guide my rocket ? You 're not going to . It 's never going to take off . Wait . What are you doing ? I 'm going to fly this thing myself . Are you crazy ? Goodbye . You come to this planet declare yourself the savior of mankind . Well , I think it 's time you died for your sins . That was my best friend . And you just killed him . When does it end , Luthor ? I 'll answer for you . It ends tonight . You ca n't touch me . We 're on American soil now . And I am the president . Consider yourself impeached . - Yeah ! Superman . Looks like

No , do n't know nothing . Big Man 's gone two days and his house burns down , you blow a real sweet score we had all set up . Does n't sound very good , does it ? McGRATH : Everybody 's got to operate like the Big Man 's still here . Like nothing 's changed . You get that , right ? Hey , I 'm not holding back on you . I just could n't get in . That 's not like you . You always figure a way . You get in wherever you want , right ? Well , two of my guys did n't show . Really ? Who ? Frankie and Tommie . Who else ?

You better have a good excuse , or I 'm gon na come over there and kick your asses . What do you want ? Let me see your arm . Whoa , look at that . So , why 'd you guys burn down the Big Man 's house ? Yo , we did n't have nothing to do with that . You do n't believe all that crap about the Big Man 's money being stashed there , do you ? We did n't mean nothing by it . No disrespect . We just wanted the money , that 's all . It was all his fault . It was his idea . - You want him ! - Shut up , Frankie

zone3	cell_phone_ringing ) Yeah , hello ? MADSO : Hey , Cheryl . It 's me . I 've been trying to call you for the last two hours . Can you talk ? What do you want ? I just want to say it was great seeing you this morning . Yeah ? Look , I 'm on my break , it 's pissing rain , and I got some shopping to do . So , what do you really want ? ( SIGHS ) Look , if anyone asks , we were at the bar last night . I came back with you to your place and I stayed there all night . Okay ? I do n't know what 's more pathetic , the fact that I 'm willing to lie for you , or that you already know I will . Look , Cheryl , if you do n't feel comfortable doing it ... Oh , please . You always
zone3	be honest about that . What are you talking about ? You say if I do n't feel comfortable I should n't do it . But you 'll keep me on the phone till I get comfortable , right ? Is n't this how it works ? Look , I got ta go . (
zone3	cell_phone_ringing ) What ? - I 'm getting ready to beat some ass here ! - BILLY : Have you heard the news ? Somebody burned the Big Man 's house down . The cops are saying it 's arson . ( CHUCKLES ) Who the hell would be stupid enough to do that ? Billy , listen . Grab Lep , get to the place by the pier . Why ? I just put a Hot Pocket in . Now . Now ! - BILLY : I ca n't believe they 're dead . - I know . It 's crazy . We got ta do something . Where do you get off ? You shot Tommie six months ago . - I shot at him , but I did n't shoot him .
zone3	well , I was pissed ! That 's not the point . The point is , these were our guys , and we got ta go after somebody . Well , that 's the thing . Who did it ? Who killed them ? They owe money to someone ? I know Tommie had that deal with the Jamaicans down in Roxbury . No , they had no beef . He moved some stuff for them , what he did n't use for himself . - Are you sure ? - Yeah , we ran into him a week ago , down at Carson Beach . They had some product coming in , they wanted to move some more stuff . That was it . It was cool . What ? Couple of weeks ago , I was drinking with Tommie , he was going off at the mouth about the Big Man , the Somerset Bank job from five years ago , - the $11 million . - BILLY : I thought it was 12 million . Yeah , whatever . You know , he said the Big Man
zone3	statute of limitations to get up . Said he had inside information . Said it was close to home . BILLY : What the hell does that mean , " close to home " ? You-know-who 's house burns down . Tommie and Frankie do n't show up for the warehouse job . The next day , they both get killed . Yeah , except nobody knows they did n't show up but us . Okay . Nobody knows shit . But the two of you , watch your backs . If Tommie and Frankie got blamed for the fire , then we could be on someone 's list , too . You want to tell me about Tommie and Frankie ? And do n't lie to me . I would n't lie to you . Well , I ca n't be sure of any of this , but I think Tommie and Frankie burned the Big Man 's house down . Figure they were looking for the Big Man 's hidden treasure . I think the Dannys killed them . I think maybe I accidentally fingered them . I
zone3	Dannys heard from me that Tommie and Frankie did n't show up for a job I was pulling last night . Now , I know you were n't too close to Tommie . He 's my nephew . I still got to tell my sister . The bottom line , I grew up with those guys . If you ask me if they were stupid enough to break into the Big Man 's house , the answer 's pretty friggin ' obvious . The two Dannys think you were in on it ? I do n't know , but I got ta make some moves . I just do n't want to step on your toes , you know ? I figured I owed you that much . You 're a good kid , Madso . Tommie should 've been more like you . We 're all on a path , Ger . He was my nephew . I knew he was a screw-up . But you looked after him , you tried to keep him useful . He was in your crew . So , therefore , he was
zone3	code , where are we ? We 're in caveman times . I get it . I owe you . Yeah , you 're damn right you owe me . Now , in terms of the two Dannys , that 's my business . I 'll take care of it . Friends are friends , but family 's got ta come first . ( SOMBERROCKMUSICPLAYING ) Oh , yeah ( INHALINGDEEPLY ) Hey , what 's up ? ( GRUNTING ) Turn off the lights Let 's go to bed Oh , yeah Let 's take the words outside instead Oh , yeah Oh , yeah WOMAN : You 're gon na like this , baby . ( GASPS ) GERRY : Oh , shit . Is this a bad time ? Hey , you know the position Tommie and Frankie put us in ? What 's right is right , Gerry . Of all the people in the world , you should understand . I 'm listening . Gerry , they went in to steal from him . They burned his house down ! With the Big Man out
zone3	You 're right . You had no choice . They stepped way over the line . But you should 've come to me first . Come on , Ger . You did n't even like the kid . He was a piece of shit junkie , you ca n't stand his mother ... You mean my sister ? Gerry , we know you your whole goddamn life . You wrote her off ! And her dirtbag kid . We knew you would n't give a shit . You presume to tell me about my family ? Why am I ... You think you 're king of the hill , Gerry ? - We did what was necessary ! - I 'll be the judge of what 's necessary . You wan na start a goddamn war or what ? We 're sorry for your loss . Put some clothes on . You 're making me nauseous . ANDREWS : Tommie Walker , as of yesterday . He 's looked better . And Frankie Jamison , who was found with a fresh , highly significant burn across his right forearm .
zone3	. So ... Of course , this is n't a clean , top-down organization , but O'Connor has kept these crews in line for 30 years . Because the Attorney General has just indicted Chris Driscoll . Chris Driscoll runs a cocaine distribution network for O'Connor . He also happens to be Danny Driscoll 's first cousin . If we get him to turn informant , then we burn his cousin , then maybe Danny One right along with him . MAN ON TV : Well , what if Doug McKay was just playing first base now ? Would this have been turned into a double play ? Maybe . - State police ! You should lock your door . - What 's up ? No shit . I already know about the indictment , sucker . Okay ? - My lawyer got a call . - Great . That 's what we want to talk to you about . About the information you have . - Yeah ? - About the information you can provide . CHRIS : Yeah ? Is that right ? Listen , I 'm supposed
zone3	But that 's tomorrow , you know ? - Yeah . Let 's talk about today . Do n't know why you ladies got ta barge in here to bring me in . Whoa ! Whoa ! - What the hell ? - ( CHUCKLING ) Next time , stay out of the way . You wo n't get blood on your Brooks Brothers . All the info we 've been feeding O'Connor over the years about rival dealers ? This guy knows everything . Did you want him informing on us ? That 's not the point ! Why did n't you tell me you were gon na do this ? Because you 're a pussy , Skip . Come on , let 's go get a beer . CHERYL : Do n't worry ? That 's what you 're saying ? I ca n't believe it . That 's what you jerked me down here for ? I 've got a job , you know ? It 's all over the news , Maddy . Two of your guys were shot dead last night . Look , what
zone3	know what 's going on ! What does that mean ? You do n't know why they were killed , or you do n't know what 's going on for you ? Are you tied into this thing ? I thought this was over between us . I thought you wanted some yuppie banker asshole to buy you a house in Beverly . I do . And do n't be a jerk . You think I do n't care about you ? Maybe you 're right . Maybe you should move on . Get rid of me . It 's only gon na get worse . ( INVESTIGATORSCHATTERING ) MAN : Right there . Another angle . GRAYSTON : Detective Herlihy . How you doing ? How are you doing ? Listen , Driscoll 's indictment was coming down , so the pencil dicks we work for at the field office are going ballistic . We need anything you got on this . Right now , we 're leaning towards a homicide . ( LAUGHING ) You think so ? Have n't we been here before , Detective ? I
zone3	It does n't have to be this way . We 're not trying to bigfoot you here . Just want to be kept in the loop . Okay . We got three homicides so far this week . We 're hitting the informants up hard , and word on the street is this may be Gerry Walker . Two Dannys killed his nephew . Now Danny Driscoll 's cousin Chris , right here , gets hit . A plus B . Media 's gon na have a field day , huh ? Well , thanks , Detective . You 've been more than helpful . All right . You guys are gon na keep me in the loop , too , right ? Absolutely . You 're in my fave five . ( AGENTSCHUCKLING ) Okay , so ? What now , hotshot ? We act like good cops and we do our job . Little bit of luck and the usual idiot behavior of our local criminals , we stay in the clear . Hey , you heard the man . Gerry Walker killed Chris Driscoll . We 'll

Who the hell does Gerry Walker think he is ? That bastard 's gon na go down this road . How do we know he 's satisfied ? Huh ? We got targets on our back now , too . What choice do we have ? - None . - We had every right to hit Tommie . - He knows it . - He had no right to bring Chris into it . Shot him right through the back of his head . It 's him or us . ( GRUNTING ) This is our town ! McGRATH : Yeah . It 's time for some payback . DRISCOLL : Let 's start with Madso 's crew . (

What 'd I tell you , Chris ? We have n't been seeing each other ! You tell him , Madso . Every Tuesday night for the last month . When you got your poker game . Plus a couple of other times , maybe three or four . Bullshit . He is lying ! Take off , Colleen . Screw ! ( GRUNTS ) MADSO : Yeah , it still hurts when I think about it . COLLEEN : I hate you ! How could you do this to me ? Now , if I hear you talking about any of this , laughing about it with your buddies , then
zone3	n't want that , right , Madso ? Right . MADSO : Chris and me had passed Colleen back and forth over the years . We did n't know it yet , but he was no longer alive to be a problem now . Why 'd you rat me out , Madso ? Would have been worse if I lied . He got us figured . Okay , I 'm glad . I 'd rather be with you . It 's just ... He gets mad . I mean , these guys kill people . Do n't be stupid , Colleen . We had our time together . Okay ? It 's over . Yeah . It was nothing but exercise anyway . Hey , Madso ! Take a last look . You wo n't be getting this anymore !

zone3	about Madso Madden ? - What makes you say that ? ' Cause I was with him that night . I just figured . Yeah , well , look , Cheryl , I could take you down to the station . We could talk about it down there if you 'd like . But you 'd have to arrest me , right ? I mean , if I did n't feel like going down there voluntarily . Then I 'd have to get a lawyer , and the first thing lawyers tell you is do n't say anything to the cops . Seems like a big waste of time . For both of us . ( LAUGHS ) You know what I ca n't figure ? Someone like you , beautiful girl , got a lot going for her . Why do you want to mess up your life hanging around a joker like Madso Madden ? I 'd get out , Cheryl . While you can .

We even cleaned it up so you wo n't dirty your hands , Madso . You open the safe , ( MUFFLEDSPEECH ) you get your buddy
zone3	hornets ' nest , burning down the Big Man 's house . - He did n't have anything to do with this . - Let me explain something to you . We do n't give a shit , okay ? You 'll open the safe or we 're gon na make sauce out of the kid and feed him to the goddamn homeless ! The mayor will give us a commendation . Let 's keep it simple . Open the safe , Madso . MADSO : It 's the Big Man 's , right ? His money in there ? The $11 million ? What 's my cut ? Your cut is , we do n't razor your balls off , send them to your mom in a gift box . Open the safe , Madso ! ( GROANING ) Or say goodbye to the midget . Look , I do n't have my tools . I do n't know the safe . I do n't know if I can pick it , or if I should drill into it . Does it have cobalt plates around the cam housing
zone3	Does it have a glass relocker ? Then we 're screwed . Or should I just blow the doors with liquid nitro ? Huh ? We 're not baking brownies here . Fine . You got four hours . I need a full day . I 'll call you when I 'm ready . And I 'm telling you , do n't hurt Lep . You touch him again and the deal 's off . No guarantees . We might get bored . Any sign of a private army ? Three guys from the lower end . I seen them around but I do n't know them . Plus Chuckie . There 's only one choice . We go in there , kill them all . Hope your good friend Lep makes it . You do n't figure there 's any percentage in trying it their way ? A minute after you open the safe , you 're a dead man . They 'll blow your head off , kill Lep , bury the bodies . What about the safe ? Assuming you 're alive , I 'd open it
zone3	mother could use a new car , some new clothes , maybe a new house . Throw in a trip to the old country . Okay . So , what do we got to lose ? Just our lives . Truth is , neither one of us is worth much . Okay , so , we start with Gerry Walker . He 's a player . Now , since Chris Driscoll got killed , the two Dannys have got to be on his case . Which means he 's on theirs . Two armed camps . It 's a death game . Winner gets to live . Gerry 's expecting us . Yeah , I know . We 're still checking . Hey ! Give him his goddamn gun back ! Now ! How far do you wan na push it ? Do n't be stupid , get yourself killed . You know Gerry 's waiting for us . Gerry . You know my cousin Kieran from the old country . Yeah . They 're still trying to clean the blood off the barroom floor there over in Dorchester from
zone3	bare hands . I do n't know if you heard . The two Dannys think I killed Chris Driscoll . Which I did n't . Not that I would n't mind . That 's what I came to talk to you about . They grabbed my buddy Lep , beat the shit out of him . They 're holding him hostage . Get this , they want me to open one of the Big Man 's safes or they 're gon na kill him . What 's inside the safe ? You think it 's the Somerset job ? Could be the $12 million . Eleven and change . Look , the bottom line , I open that safe , I figure I 'm not coming home . So , how do I fit into this ? I figure you 're not gon na sit around waiting for them to use you and Ronnie for target practice . Seems like we got some common interests here . You know how I feel about money . Oh , yeah . You like it . ( CHUCKLING ) That 's for sure
zone3	this thing up . Wait . You 're just gon na let him make the plan ? Yeah . I 'm going to work it out . Show some respect here . Whatever you say , cousin . How many guys has he got on his side ? Five , that I could see . At least . So they 're paranoid , scared and ready . Obviously . I do n't need some second-rate hoodlum that makes brown bag collections to agree with anything I say . Hey , why do n't you relax ? So , you got five guys . Chuckie and two Dannys . Figure we 'll need the five of us , I 'll grab a couple of guys outside . We need at least seven . KIERAN : What is this ? Some class in simple arithmetic ? We have surprise on our side . You go in there with too many soldiers and obviously you lose that element of surprise . Well , I think the idea is we go in quiet . With those monkeys out there ? Quiet ? Hey !
zone3	all right ? I do n't feel much like getting shot , but if I do , there ought to be a reason . Human stupidity does n't count . Hey , hey ! Where you going ? Back to Ireland . Where you 're not bumping up against some amateur gunman every minute of the day . Jesus Christ . I thought he was with us . What a pussy . I 'm sorry , I had no idea he was gon na go off like that . Let him go . Let him go . He 's a nut . He 's a loose cannon and he always has been . Madso , I 'll tell you right now . The person I 'm concerned about is you . This is n't robbing some warehouse . You got to put a gun in a guy 's face , look him in the eye and pull the trigger . You capable of that ? - Let 's do this , huh ? - Hey , listen . It was me who told the two Dannys that Tommie and Frankie
zone3	had no idea it was gon na get them killed , you know . I just ... Those two buttheads got themselves killed . Okay ? I 'm surprised it did n't happen a lot sooner . - Well , stuff 's going down tonight . - Well ... - I just wanted to be straight with you . - Do n't worry about it . We 're doing this for our boys . Now , let 's go get Lep . Where are the rest of your guys ? I figured his cousin was right . We do n't need them . Well , is n't that a wicked pisser . GERRY : Nice touch , Madso . You know what the hell you 're doing ? You 'd better hope so . I punch in the wrong code , the timer sets off a warning system . What 's the code ? Two-three-six-nine , the numbers worn down on the keypad . Now , each number has a letter equivalent . Now , people program these things , usually personalize them , spell out a word . What
zone3	. Besides that . They 're in love with themselves . - Right . Three-two-six-six-nine . - ( TIMERBEEPING ) " Danny . " If I 'm wrong , we 're dead . ( LAUGHS ) ( INAUDIBLE ) ( CHATTERING ) (

zone3	breathing_heavily ) Yeah . ( MUFFLEDGRUNTING ) ( GRUNTINGCONTINUES ) - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Thanks for coming to get me . ( STRAINING ) God ! Come on . Hey , ladies . Let 's go . Open that safe ? I said open the safe . Now ! I did n't figure you for a ... Double-crossing prick ? Just business . Throw your gun down and open that safe . Good evening , gentlemen . ( GROANING ) ( GUNSHOTS ) I figured it

The joke 's on us , Gerry . You got ta be shitting me . Not a penny . ( CHUCKLING ) ( GROANS ) Maybe I should kill him . MADSO : Just because he double-crossed us ? We knew he would . Using your cousin as insurance . You 're a smart prick , Madso . I knew I could n't trust you . Nothing personal . I always liked you . Just too much money in play . Yeah , well , Billy 's dead . That 's what matters . I grew up with him . Yeah , and Ronnie was like my kid brother . So , what now ? I 'm taking off . No fingerprints . What , you 're not going to kill me ? I figure you got a taste for it by now .
zone3	to the cops . Regardless . I 'm still no rat . Yeah , but remember this , Gerry , now we 're even . ( GRUNTS ) Thanks for coming for me , Billy . Do n't blame yourself for Billy . It 's not the player , it 's the game . I 'll be going . I 'll get you to a hospital . Nah . There 's doctors in this city that take care of us boys from Ireland . Up the Irish . See you around . ( SIGHING ) (
zone3	knocking_on_door ) I 'm shot . I need help . I ca n't go to the hospital , I 'll get busted . Well , you gon na help me or what ? I wo n't blame you if you do n't want to . MADSO : Just one small thing for my circle of green . (
zone3	bell_tolling ) MADSO : Bless me , Father , for I have sinned . It 's been a long time since my last confession . What are your sins , my son ? Aw , you

( GUNSHOT ) No , law of the jungle is , " Monkeys do n't screw with elephants . " You got a way of making everything around you exciting . But in the end , I got ta face the fact that you 're just a bad bet . He was in your crew . So , therefore , he was your responsibility . If you do n't live by a code , where are we ? You open the safe , you get your buddy back . It 's about order . Remember that . Bogie One . Bogie One . We 've got company . Two armed camps . It 's a death game . Winner gets to live .

The nightmares were the first sign that something was wrong with me . They were coming every night . My parents wrote them off as raging teenage hormones . Looking back on it now , maybe they were right . Thing is , a guy like me should n't have been having nightmares at all . From the outside , my life was a dream ... great school , great friends , beautiful girl on my arm . I was a quarterback in a town where football was the one true religion . Go ! Blue 45 ! Blue 45 ! Check ! Check ! Hike ! Go ! Look at him go ! Yes ! I guess sometimes everybody feels like they do n't fit in , but it was becoming clearer and clearer to me that I ... Unh ! Really
zone3	after that night , everyone else knew it , too . Hey , Richards , clean yourself up . You watch yourself , Brad . Next time , 15 yards . Come on . I slipped . Yeah . Yeah . I swear . Let 's go . Run them back . Richards ! Whoo ! Like that , huh ? Oh , I know you like that . Look at that . Look at your boy . Now , any guy in this situation would be experiencing an insane adrenaline rush , but I 'm pretty sure this was n't normal . I felt sick about what I did to Brad . It was n't like me at all . Everyone had questions ... Brad 's parents , the police and the principal . But what did he want me to tell him ? About my nightmares , my temper on edge , the sudden rushes of inexplicable strength ? He was looking for an explanation , I guess . Everyone was , but I could only think of one that made any sense . I think I 'm

We have a 17-year-old girl reporting an assault by her boyfriend . See signs of violence . Excuse me , ma'am . Stay in the car , please . Cayden . It was Cayden . Miss . He 's a monster . So my nightmares had come true . I had killed the two people I loved most in the world . I was a monster . And just like that ... my old life was gone . I never knew when I 'd lose control , so I just kept running ,

Handsome guy like you , you 're a rare catch out here . No arguing that . Do you need a menu , hon ? Just a coffee . Thanks . Lisa , I understand you were with Cayden the night of the murders . He attacked me . Was Cayden angry or upset over the fact that he was adopted , perhaps ? What ? I did n't know he was adopted . He never mentioned that he was adopted ? - No . - Funny thing was , up until that moment , I had n't known it either . Unh ! Unh ! Unh ! Oh , jeez ! Uhh ! Hey ! Leave her alone !

It 's a pretty tough place to be , is n't it , killer ? I 've seen tougher . Ah , I 'm speaking metaphorically , boy ... about life . It 's hard . Can be , I guess . Yep . Can be . Life is like an onion . That 's what they say . The more you peel it back , the more it makes you cry . Especially when you 're afflicted . You know ... afflicted ? Holy shit .

No , they , um ... they did n't know . What ? You 're gon na tell me , like , you were adopted or something ? Yeah , that 's right . I was . I would have loved to have seen the look on their faces when you turned for the first time , mate . " Oh , he 's a monster ! He 's gon na kill us ! Oh , no , it 's ... " Eh , none of my business .

You 're not my responsibility , kid . I do n't know anything about ... Figure it out yourself . What I am . I have no idea . Joe , nothing . I 'll show you the way . It never came from me . You understand ? Yeah . Yeah . Y-You got it . I

Oh , hey , you know if there 's any work around here ? Heh . Nope . Ask him to dance . You are new here . Heh . Yeah . Yeah . Heh heh . I mean , right ? So you want to dance ? I 'm not really much of a dancer . Oh , come on . Any one of these guys would love to dance with me . I 'm sure they would , and that means you 'll never be lonely . Fag . Thanks . That 's great . What 's your

It 's , uh ... Oh , I 'm sorry . Did I stump you ? Hey . Hey , you were hassling my girl ? She said you grabbed her ass . Well , she made a mistake . Oh , I see .

I hear you say that you were looking for work ? I do n't know . Did you ? Yep . Danny , I 'd like you to meet my wife Clara . Welcome , Danny . It 's an honor . Damn ! Bull testicles . Those rocks , they hack my plow blades up something terrible , I 'll tell you . Yeah , I think I can get it out of there for you . No . Do n't even think about it . You 'll wrench your back . That 's what the bucket 's for . Well , I 'll be damned . Heh . It really was n't in that deep . I 'd come to Lupine Ridge looking for answers , and what I found was this place , a farm . Who 'd have thought ? Good people with
zone3	pry . All John asked was that the work got done . Even if the Tollermans had no idea what I was , the animals sure did . But , all in all , things seemed pretty fine , and for the first time in a long time , I felt safe . Oh . Uh ... hey . New farmhand . Uh , pardon me ? John took you on just like that . J-Just like what ? Is there a vetting process ? Where you from , kid ? I 'm sorry . Who are you ? Connor . Oh , I see you 've ... you 've met my new hand Danny . Danny , is it ? Yeah . He 's my nephew from out west . Your nephew ? That 's funny . I saw you both at the bar the other night . Sure . I was there . I did n't see the two of you speak . It 's a funny way to treat a nephew . Well , tell you the truth , I did n't recognize him at first .
zone3	as sharp as they used to be . Mm . John , who the hell is that guy ? Danny , you do n't want to know . What 's wrong ? ! What 's happening ? Sheep need feeding . No . Animal . What ? Ah , well , animals . When things get scarce up in the hills , the wolves come down here to feed . Oh , I see . That 's what you ... That 's what you think it was ? What else could it be ? Um , that ... just like you said . Ah , the poor little bleater . Ah , well , look on the bright side . Bright side ? Clara , that smells wonderful . Back with gravy . Help yourself . Yeah . How often you guys losing sheep ? Oh , it happens . Wolves have to eat , too , you know . I 'll take that . Wolves . Is that where the town gets its name , Lupine Ridge ? What 's that ? " Lupine . " It means wolf
zone3	... it means wolflike . What 's the difference ? Ah ... Mmm . I 'm not going to do any killing . You not defend yourself ? Oh , I 'll shoot if I have to , but I 'll shoot to wound , not to kill . Tonight at 11:00 , after the discovery of two mutilated members of a Colorado biker gang , bearing a grisly similarity to the Cannibal Kid murders , a frightened nation is asking , where is Cayden ... Um , I 'm gon na go into town . Well , I can see why that would require you to turn off the TV . Heh heh . I just , uh ... thought I 'd let you know . Mm . Hey , Cayden . Your name 's Cayden Slaughter , right ? No , it 's ... Who are you ? I 'm Carter Wills . I 'd be , uh , your second cousin , I guess . My what ? Listen , the others might be too afraid to say it , but you have to haul ass on
zone3	na get us all killed . I think you think I 'm somebody else . No , you think you 're somebody else . And listen , he does n't know who you are yet . Only a few of us do , but you think he 's not gon na find out ? And when he does ... Who 's gon na find out what ? What are you talking about ? Heh . You really do n't know shit , do you ? It 's Connor , man . County Police do n't even come up here anymore . He decides who lives and who dies . Yeah . He kicked my own brother out of town . Oh , God . Ah , Jesus . So get out of here , kid , please . Excuse me . What ? ! I 'm allowed to have one of these , you know . I 'm part owner here . Stop drinking all our beer , Gail ! Do n't even know what you 're talking about . I do n't even know . Could I just get
zone3	Here . So , back again . Well , it is the only bar in town . And how do you find our little town so far ? Strange , like it 's got secrets . Yeah , well , does n't everybody ? Hey , judgy , how ' bout next time I tell you when you 've had ... I 've had enough ? Okay . Is she gon na be okay ? Yeah , as okay as she gets . How does she keep her job ? It 's tough to fire your own sister . Oh , so you really do own this place . What are you , some kind of small-town princess or something ? Small-town heiress , actually . Both our parents are dead . I 'm , um ... I 'm sorry . Both of my parents are dead ... as well . Well , then ... tribute to orphans . Hey , buddy . Hey . Uh , so ... what 's up , fellas ? Saw you talking to the kid , Carter . W-What kid ? The one Tollerman
zone3	yeah . That asshole . What 'd you tell him , exactly ? Tell him ? Nothing . Well , just to get out of town , you know , hit the road . Why 's that ? ' Cause I saw him sniffing around Angelina . I figured ... maybe he was pissing you off . So you told him about me ? Wh ... No . Ah , shit , no , othing . That 's funny . Thought I heard my name . Ah , hell , no , Connor . Hey , I just played it off as , you know , small town , we do n't like outsiders . Hmm . I 'm having a problem here , Carter . See , I know this kid 's from one of the old lines . Maybe he 's from here . Maybe he 's from down east , from the Synod . Maybe . But what I 'm really trying to figure out is why Tollerman took him on so quick and also why a useless drunk like you would take any interest in him
zone3	are being kept from me . No . Listen , you know what I know . So you did n't tell him anything about us , and you got nothing to tell me about him ? No , no . Connor , no way . You got ta believe me . And this has nothing to do with your brother Joe ? You tell me right now , who is this fucking kid , huh ? What 's he doing here , and can I tear his nuts out without facing any backlash ? Oh , God , I do n't know . I do n't . I do n't know anything . I just tried to get him to leave , save us all a bunch of trouble . That sounds believable . Heh heh . So now I guess the only thing left to do is to make sure that you do n't tell him anything else before I 'm ready to deal with him . No , I w ... I wo n't . I swear it . Now , Carter , you know what a promise
zone3	ourselves a night hunt , boys ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Oww ! You know how this works , Carter . So run . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Ready or not , here we come . You smell that ? Oh , my God . Sorry . You smell that , right , that reek ? Yeah . Can you ? We 're downwind . An asthmatic with a head cold could smell it from here . What are you doing out here ? They 've killed someone . I need to find out who . Okay , you can look , but do n't make a sound . No way . What are they eating ? His name was Carter , Carter Wills . We got ta go . Now . They were ... They were , all of ' em ... Wolves , yeah . Just like you . ... a star student , a gifted athlete , but no one suspected the insanity that lay within ... Great . They 're playing that crap now . No , son . We had it
zone3	. I 'm so sorry . What are you sorry about ? It 's not your fault . No , son . It 's my fault . Ah . This is your mother . My mother ? Lucinda was my sister 's girl . What a beauty she was . We 've been here a long time , Werewolves of the Eastern Coast . We came here on the ships , first ships . ' Course , there 's not many of the old lines left . Most of us paired up with the locals , thinning the breed , like this one here . Too beautiful to resist . I 'm not part of the pack , you see . I just like men with chest hair . There 's two ways to become a wolf , Cayden . You can be born into it , like you , me , Angel and her sister , or you can be infected with it , bitten by a purebred , but those , those will never have the power of a pureborn wolf . They 'll change , but it
zone3	he is one of the last of the purebred wolves for miles . All this really started when Lucinda caught his eye . She was a town wolf , one of the last of the pure lines . In his eyes , she was made for him . He came in the night and took her by force . Lucinda got pregnant with you . What ? No . John , what you 're saying is that ... that that asshole up in the hills is ... is my father ? By blood , he is , yeah . When her father found out she was pregnant , he threatened to kill her , so we faked Lucinda 's death . I hid her away in our cellar till she came to term . We agreed that Connor must never find out about you , Cayden , so I convinced Lucinda ... to give you up for adoption . Brokenhearted , she let you go . And she killed herself that September . Once Lucinda was gone ... Connor got worse . He formed a savage pack . He bit
zone3	those hills there to run and hunt and kill ... spending less and less time in human form . It gets into you , you see , the wild . So , the deal was they 'd live up there and none of us town wolves would interfere with them and we would both keep the secret from the outside . But now ... ow Connor 's getting older ... and he 's thinking about his legacy . Meaning what , exactly ? Now that she 's come of age ... Connor intends to have a son ... with one of the last purebred wolves in town . No . Yeah . That 's the deal . When ? When he decides it 's time . And you 're just gon na go along with it ? I have to . If I back out , if I try to leave , he 'll murder John , Clara , my sister , everyone . Jesus . Cayden , stop . He does n't care about the law . He does n't care if he dies . He 'll butcher anyone
zone3	want ? What I want ? I want to move to a city , live my life , but this is the only way to protect the people that I love . If I give him a son , he 'll let me go . Then I 'll be free . A son , like me , and then this whole thing goes on and on . Yeah . Well , it 's been going on forever . You should n't have come back here . You 're too good for this place . Do n't say that . Why not ? Because ... I ... I killed my parents . I do n't remember it . I just woke up , and they were dead , torn apart . You know , my father , he was a world champion drunk , my dad . He killed my mom one full moon . He came home drunk , angry , and he just ... When he came around and he found her , he cut his own throat . Gail and I kicked it around for years . Was
zone3	? Or just the booze ? I do n't know . But it always seemed to be in him somehow , that potential for blind murder . The thing is it does n't seem to be in you . Well , it is . Moonlight , violence , I feel it . I know . I can feel it , too . But that 's our big question , right ? Is it a gift or a curse ? So which is it ? Come on . I 'll show you . Seeing things the way we see them , the scents , the sounds ... this bond with nature ... Mama always said it was a power and a gift . There , you feel that ? Cayden ? So then , what do we do , let the beast run wild , let it kill whoever gets in our way ? Of course not . We use it , learn to control it . And we 'd only ever kill anyone who threatens the one's we love . That 's really hot . Angel , that 's ,
zone3	? ' Cause it seems like a pretty good idea . It 's been a long , long time since ... What ? Wait . Not ... Never ? Well , no , not never , exactly , just rarely without ... incident . I see . You 're afraid the excitement , the adrenaline might make you change . Yeah , that 's right . Okay ? Okay . So what ? I mean , if anything were to happen , that 's how I 'd want it . Yeah . Hello in the barn ! Hello ? Just a sec . Hey , John . Hey yourself . How 's things ? Good , yeah . Yeah . Good . Very , very , very good . Yeah ? I think we 're all ... think we 're all pretty good . Good . And , uh , where 's Angel ? Has she gone home ? Uh , no . Up here . Ah . Hey , John ... Yeah ? Do you think Clara might have a ... a blouse or something I can borrow ?
zone3	your shirt ! Larson , just a matter of defending ourselves . It 's suicide . We ca n't fight ... We got ta do it now . You know what they left of my little brother ? Well ... Here 's your coffee , gentlemen . Ah , here he is . Cayden , these are the town wolves . This is all that 's left of the old lines . And , everyone , this ... is Lucinda 's boy . I knew I knew that scent ! I knew it the first time I saw him . Did n't I say it ? We all said it , Gail . I said it first . Now , this is , uh , Larson Wills . He would be your second cousin , I guess . Yeah . Nice to meet you , kid . You know , my little brother Carter , he was your cousin , too . Now he 's yesterday 's dinner . I 'm sorry . I did n't plan for any of this to happen . Hear that , everybody ? He
zone3	. It just got kicked . Cayden came back here because he belongs here . We all get to pay the price for it , Clara . And this is Mayor Robinson . He 's an optimist . I 'm a realist . Connor is getting paranoid . If he thinks this kid has come here to ... interfere with Angelina , then he and his pack are gon na come down from those hills , and they 'll kill him , and then they 're gon na kill us for trying to hide him . Maybe they wo n't . Are you nuts ? This close to the full moon ? Shit , even I can barely keep from freaking out . When is the full moon ? Tomorrow night . Halloween . Jesus . Well , hey , what 's more Halloween than getting eaten by a wolfman ? God , lighten up . Listen , he 's getting crazier and crazier . We got one option . Give him Angelina , and give him the kid . You 're a real hero , Larson Wills . At
zone3	They 're your own flesh and blood ! No ! This is my flesh and blood . All right , all right . Calm down , Larson . Just calm down here . Now , uh , we like to pretend that we have got an uneasy peace with Connor and his pack up there . Sometimes some livestock goes missing . Sometimes a child goes missing ... but there 's not one of us who ca n't follow that scent . There 's not one of us who does n't know where that child 's gone . Yes , John , it happens . But it 's not fear that stops us from doing anything about it , it 's practicality . Those guys up there are wolves all the time . Hell , John , some of us ai n't even changed in years . I ca n't even barely grow my sideburns anymore . It 's just a little fuzz . He 's the youngest and the strongest . Connor kills him , he 'll have no more reason to come after us . And then what
zone3	the deal we made . The deal I made . Well , I did n't . Stay in your homes tonight , and lock your doors . I 'll take care of this . No , son . Do n't do it . He 'll kill you . Maybe . No ! Cayden ! I mean he 'll kill you . Maybe I can take him with me . No ! John , please . You got ta stop him . How ? Look , Tollerman and the others broke the pact , brought the kid in from the outside . What are we gon na do about it ? The kid has to go . They 're not gon na give him up without a good fight . Tollerman wo n't allow it . So if he wo n't come to us , then we 'll have to go and take him . Yeah , okay . Or I could just come to you . You must be insane , boy . Maybe . Could be hereditary . Tell me something , kid . Did the Synod send you
zone3	You really do n't know shit , do you ? I know about Lucinda . I know you took her by force . You watch your mouth , boy . Before you all try to kill me , I 'm just here to tell you something , Connor . Lucinda Wills was my mother . That 's not possible . Lucinda died before she gave birth . That 's what Tollerman told you . The truth is she committed suicide a few days after I was born . Is that right ? I 'm gon na give you the same chance I give everyone . Run . No . You can either leave this town alone and let Angelina go ... Or ? You 'll force me to stop you . Okay , then . Kill him . Come on , then ! Check that way . Okay then . Who 's next ? I 'm pretty sure it 's you , kid . Oh , God . They 're killing him ! No . Angel ! Angel ! You ca n't help him ! Boy . Animal ! Cayden
zone3	. Lucinda got pregnant . She let you go . Lucinda died before she gave birth . She killed herself that September . He 's a monster . At least Angel survives . Do n't you get that ? They 're your own flesh and blood . I 'll give you the same chance I give everyone . How do you think I got so pretty ? Run . Oh , yeah . This does n't look good . Losing your life force , you ca n't even hold your true form . Wild Joe ? Get up , you little sucker . Get up . It 's over . Get up ! Get up ! Get up ! Get up . Oh , my God . John ! John ! I was trying not to kill them . That was a mistake . It 's life or death out here . I ... I need a hospital or a vet or something . You do n't need a hospital . You need to change . You have to get out and run . I ca n't . It 's
zone3	. If you do n't , son , you ai n't gon na make it . Just try . Jesus ! I ca n't . I ca n't . It 's okay . It 's okay . Okay , you need to run . Oh , my God . Angel , that 's not gon na happen right now . You have to , okay ? It 's the only way . Trust me . Go . Oh , God . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . Jesus . Aah ! What 's the word , Kino ? All the guys are pretty messed up , slashes , broken bones . Get them up and running . They 'll feel better . Well , the rest of us do n't heal like you do , like he does . That 's if he survived the fall . So , you think it 's true ? You think the kid is your son ? I ca n't beat them . There 's way too many . If I go back up there , they 'll
zone3	You think I could do that ? No . I have to beat them , all of them . Otherwise , John , Clara , you , the whole town will never be safe . I know there 's got to be a way . I just ca n't think of it . I 'm sorry I got you into all this shit . What ? Do n't be . It 's not your fault . I got myself into all this shit . Come on . Whoa ! What is that horrible stench ? Oh , excuse me , my dear . That is my personal collection of genuine , A1 , organic , fully recycled ovine detritus , and it is extremely good for the soil . And extremely explosive , right ? ? Yeah ? I 'll be glad when you 're dead ? You rascal , you ? I 'll be glad when you 're dead ? You rascal , you ? When you 're dead and in your grave ? No more women will you crave ? I 'll be glad when you 're dead
zone3	next one . Yeah . What are the shotgun shells for ? Trigger . Take a keen eye , though . Oh , keenest eye in the northeast , son . You know , it 's gon na wreak havoc on your land , John . Well , better my land than your lives . I 'm gon na set up inside . I 'm going up there with you . No . If anything happens to you , all of this was for nothing . Run home . Pack your bags . When all this is over , meet me at the motel at the bottom of the hill . Then we 'll leave . We 'll be free . Clara ! Angel ! Maybe someone noticed something back in town . Maybe they 'll send somebody for help . When they grabbed me , I did n't see a single person left . It 's like all the normal one's left town , like they knew . She 's right . They knew . John Tollerman . Ladies . Ca n't thank you enough for coming to my
zone3	n't stay away . Yeah . Tell me something , John . Where 's the kid ? The kid 's dead . We buried him where he fell . I guess lies come easy after 20 years of ' em , right ? It 's no lie . He was your son , and you killed him . Bullshit , John . If he were my son , that would mean you 'd hidden Lucinda away from me , hey , lied to me for more than 20 years , and you 'd have to know how you 'd suffer for that . You think I 'm afraid of dying ? It 's not the dying , John . It 's what comes first . Oh , yeah ! Uh-oh . Oh , shit . It 's the big moment . Can you believe I 'm a little bit nervous ? You ought to be . Okay , John . Oh , my God . What have they done to her , John ? She 's been drugged . Do n't worry , Angel . This 'll all be over
zone3	Hey , I 'm doing this for you , Angel . I 'm doing this for all of us . This sucks . We 're missing the whole party . Hey , if Connor says he 'll show , he 'll show , and then we kill him . And then we 'll party . Huh ? Did you hear that ? Connor ... Friends , been a long time coming , this night , and what a thing , having my badass pack here to see it . Connor ! And I want to thank Angel here for just making me the happiest wolf in the woods . Oh , shit . It 's like we 're mated already . Well , best get on with it , eh ? Connory Slaughter ... Yes ! Alpha dog ... leader of the pack , do you take this bitch for ... well , tonight , basically ? I do . Angelina Timmins , owner of the only bar in town ... do you take ... Uh , Deke ... she does . All right . Well , uh , it
zone3	us , you guys enjoy yourselves , and we 'll be back in , let 's say , 20 minutes . Oh , hell , make it 40 . Unless , of course , anyone 's got any objections . Does n't count , Gail . All right , then . Let 's do it . I have an objection ! Did n't I tell you ? Did n't I warn you to leave these people alone ? Well , they 're my pack , boy . They do what I tell ' em . This is n't a pack . Wolves do n't terrorize towns or kidnap innocents or brutalize women . You 're barely wolves at all ! Okay , then , boys , let 's show him what we really are ! Hey ! You traitorous bitch ! Go , John ! Save him ! Okay , here we go . Listen to me , all of you ! Turn back , and survive ! Stay ... and I 'll kill you all . Bring him to me now . What in the hell ? Find him
zone3	ta be smart about this ! We got ... You ca n't hide from me , boy . Go , John , now ! Ah , my poor barn . Holy shit . This is my town , you little bastard ! You did this to me ! You made me the monster I am ! Not monster enough , apparently . I guess you really did have some fight in you , kid . Come on . Goodbye , Connory Slaughter . No ! You 've done hideous things in your life , and you deserve to die . You 're right . But you should know ... I never took Lucinda by force . I loved her , and she loved me . When her father found out she was pregnant , he threatened to kill her , so I took the fall for it . They took the woman that I loved away from me ... and I just ... became the monster they said I always was . Well , I tell you , boys , being here to witness this happy homecoming warms the cockles
zone3	Wahoo ! I knew it . Joe Wills . All these years later , hey , it 's Connory Slaughter beaten , on his knees . See that eye of yours never healed , did it ? Nope . Just a one-eyed Jack with the gimpy limp so I 'd never forget what you did to me . You know what your old man told me when he exiled me from this town ? He said that I was too wild , too brutal . Swore I 'd come back and kill you . He just laughed at me . But the kid was the key . You never knew he existed . You never heard the stories . But my little brother Carter , he told me , he told me all about it . Why do n't you just turn around and crawl right out of town ? You think I went to all this trouble tracking your offspring down , bringing him here , killing his parents just to walk away , just to let you live ? You did what ? What ? Oh , yeah
zone3	made the cops think it was you . Why ? ! Why ? To get you to grow up , to bring you here , to put him in this exact situation ! You son of a bitch ! Ah , forget it . You 're too beat up to fight me now , I mean , the both of youse . I 'd beat you with one hand tied behind my back . This is my day ! Oh , baby , I 've earned it . Hey , Joe ... Yeah . You know your brother Carter ? He 's my favorite . I had him for dinner two days ago . Ah , sweet dreams , Connor . I 'll kill you , Joe ! Kill me ? You 're my trained dog , boy . I 've been waiting for this for a long time . You were never too wild for this town , Joe . Just too crazy . Ah , damn . Ah ... help me , kid . Huh ? No ? Ever been shot in the shoulder ? It 's like
zone3	shoulder . So , are you gon na kill me now , too , huh ? Before you do , give you an interesting little tidbit . Wolves , real wolves , they only kill for food or defense . Well , I 'm not a wolf , Joe . I 'm a human being . That 's my point , son . They 're all calling you a murderer , a cold-blooded killer . It 's not true . It 's not what you are . I 've killed tonight , because of you . No , kid . Because you had to . It was Connor . It 's always been Connor . He made us this way . He did it to all of us . Well , Connor 's dead now , Joe . That 's right . I killed the monster that made you , boy ... so we 're all paid up . We 're even . Even ? Yeah . Is that what we are ? You know ... I guess it 's true . I never have killed anyone in cold blood
zone3	my fucking parents . All right , boy ! Come on ! Show me what you got ! What I 've got , Joe ? Yeah . Fu ... Hey . Hey . There . That should fertilize the soybeans . And no one need ever know . So who 's up for some breakfast ? John , I got ta go . So soon ? Well , you , uh ... you got a home here now , you know . Nah , I ... I know , and we 'll be back . It 's just that ... It 's ... It 's me , John . I need to get away from here , for a while , anyway . Well ... you got something you 'd better take with you , then . Now , uh , this , this is a very rare piece . It ... It traces all the old lines all the way back , so you keep it safe . So many . Yeah . Yeah . John , I ... I ca n't take this from you . This is
zone3	'll come in handy . Wherever you go , you look for those names . It 'll give you a heads-up . Well , thank you , Clara . You take care . Yeah . Thanks for everything ... Yeah . Uncle John . Yeah . ? Come on , come on now ? With time slipping away ? Yeah ? I ca n't say what I 'll do Whoo ! ? You 've got nothing to say ? Oh , Lord , no ? Well , I 'll tell you who 's who ? Oh , yeah ? ' Cause I 'm the big bad wolf ? What you say ? ? I 'm the big bad wolf ? What you say ? ? I 'm the big bad wolf ? Blowing down your neighborhood ? What you say ? ? I said a-whoo ? Oh , yeah , now ? A-whoo ? What you say ? ? I said ? You got to seize up your day ? Yeah ? Make the most out of you ? Oh , you got to make the most ? Watch your
zone3	with my crew ? Oh , you know why ? ? ' Cause they 're the big bad wolves ? What you say ? ? They 're the big bad wolves ? What you say ? ? They 're the big bad wolves ? Blowing down your neighborhood ? What you say ? ? I said a-whoo ? Oh , yeah , now ? A-whoo ? What you say ? ? What you say ? ? We 're the big bad wolves ? What you say ? ? We 're the big bad wolves ? What you say ? ? We 're the big bad wolves ? What you say ? ? Ah , the big bad wolves ? What you say ? ? Said now ? What you say ? ? Big bad wolves ? What you say ? ? I said it now ? What you say ? ? All right now ? What you say ? ? Ahh ? Whoo ? A-whoo ? Oh , yeah , yeah
zone3	4050075 I 'm not gon na hold back . I warned the others that I would n't . Recording it like this is so important to us . I guess it 's our way of telling ourselves that we matter . That we mean something . Maybe ... some of the things we 've done ... and the friends that we 've lost ... hopefully it all makes a difference somehow . There 's only one way to do this . And that 's to go back to where it all began . What , with Kevin ? When ? Last night . He came over to help with the shearing . Some sheep got out and dad went after them . We were all by ourselves for , like , 20 minutes . You did it in a shearing shed ? - In the bed of soft pure merino wool . My God , you 're such a nimpho . You can talk , Ellie . What about you and Steve at rehearsals last year . Oh please , we never went that far . - Now ... pinky swear not to tell . Pinky swear ? Is that
zone3	's been my best mate for as long as I can remember . Whenever I had a problem , I 'd go tell Corrie and somehow , she 'd always fix it . So , how was it ? - Well , not how I expected . I feel different somehow . Like a real woman . I wan na do more , see more . I wan na be more . What would you wan na do ? How about a trip before we get back to school ? We have n't been at the river in ages . - Sure . Maybe dad will let us have a Landrover . Maybe Kevin can come with us ? I see . You 'd like to have more sex , is that it ? - No ... Well , yeah . Look , we 'll get a bunch of us together and ... if your dad lets us have a Landrover , we should go further up the river than we 've ever been before . Even up to Taylor 's Stitch . And all the way into Hell .
zone3	. Nobody goes there . Yes . Why do n't you go up the river again ? You always loved that . Because we wan na go somewhere we have n't gone before . Make it a real adventure . - Why Landrover ? Why not the bikes ? Or horses even . Like in an old fashioned camp out . That 'd be fun . Guys , I 'm not ten anymore . Besides , if there was an emergency , would n't you prefer that I had Landrover ? I do n't know , Ellie . It 's a pretty big ask . Like it or not , dad , I 'm turning 18 this year . Do n't you think it 's time I started showing initiative and ... independence and all those other good things ? C'm on . It 's just a couple of days . What 's the worst that could possibly happen ? But the show is on this weekend . - So what ? Do you really care if your mom wins best decorated cake ? Flip ! I always pictured Kevin
zone3	and bringing up his 3 kids . - Alright . With Corrie , if she got her way . - Anything for you . And she usually did . Please , tell him he can go to the bloody show if he wants to . There 's plenty of guys who 'd kill to come with us . Come on , who else can we ask ? - Somebody fun . Homer . I 'll see you next weekend , sunshine . Homer grew up on the farm next to mine . He was kind of like a brother to me . He was always getting into trouble . Both in school and out . The new police sergeant arrested him 3 times in one week . Hey , sarge , how 're you going ? Good ? That did n't slow down Homer . - Alright . - Yeah ? How 's the wife , is she good ? I think it was the proud rebellious greek side of him . He just did n't care what he did . Or what anyone thought of him . How about
zone3	Yeah , I 'll have a go at that . Just you girls going ? - Yeah , and Kevin . - It 'll be good for you to have a man around . To do all the hard work for you . Well , that 's four . Anyone else ? What about Fiona Maxwell ? Fifi , out in the bush ? Seriously ? Oh gosh ! You really want me ? Fi was the only person I knew under 60 who said ' gosh ' . Well , no . But our parents said we had to bring someone along with a little bit of class . To balance out all us inbred rurals . She lived in town , but we liked her anyway . Okay . Give me a sec and I 'll ask mom . Mommy , can I please go camping with the girls this weekend ? Camping , out in the bush ? Seriously ? I 'll admit it , Lee was an odd choice . He was always working in his mom and dad 's restaurant , or of course playing
zone3	just thought he was interesting . May I take your order ? - No , sorry , I do n't wan na order anything . Is this for pick-up or for take-away ? No , I would like to speak to your son Lee . Is he available ? You have menu ? - No . Yes I do , but I do n't wan na order anything . What you want ? - I want Lee . Your son Lee . I want Lee . I want Lee . - This is Lee . Good evening . This is Ellie Linton . I sat next to you in geography last year . It was on tuesdays . I have ... sort of longish dark hair . - Yeah , I know who you are , Ellie . Good . Well , some friends of mine and I are ... We 're skipping the show this weekend and we 're going camping instead . I was ... We were wondering if ... maybe ... if you wanted to come with us ? Or not ? No , that would be
zone3	'll put you down then . It was actually ... - My mom makes me go help out now . Can you text me the details ? Yes , I can ... Yes . I 'll do that . Alright . See you . - B ... bye . Lee made it six . But dad said we had to have eight . Eventually we compromised on 7 , as long as Robyn was the 7th . Sorry , Robyn . If it was just you girls but with boys ? Not without an adult present . Of course , if parents ever had a daughter they could trust , it was Robyn . Well , the boys will be in separate tents , dad . And besides , this camping trip is n't about romance or anything . It 's more about getting back to nature . You know , we 're all kind of ... cooped up in this modern environment , and I think this camping trip will help me to help my friends become closer to God . Because we need to share a spiritual connection
zone3	that I 'd be able to reach these girls . And these boys as much as I would like to . Are you alright , Fi ? You 're looking a bit pale . You look like you 're gon na ... It 's stuck in the back of your throat , is n't it ? You 're trying to swallow it all down . But it just keeps coming back up . Okay , I got it . How much stuff do you need ? - Oh my God Ellie , look at this ! Wait , what is this ? Makeup ? You never know who you 're going to meet . Hey , you can see Cobbler 's Bay from here . You can even see the Heron Bridge . How far do you reckon we 've come ? - That was the easy part . From here on , we walk . Ready ? On the count of three . One ... Give me a decent throw , sweetheart . Let 's go . I meant to do that . Homer , do you even know
zone3	ahead . This is very pretty for Hell . I wonder how long it 's been since anyone 's been down here . I wonder if anyone has ever been down here , I mean ... why would anyone else 've bothered ? - Maybe we 're the first one's to see it . There 's no reception . - What were you expecting , broadband ? Could n't hurt . You , what 's your name . Go get some firewood , will you ? It 's Lee . Ellie , what are we having for dinner ? Two-minute noodles . - Oh , great ! What are they ? You 've never heard of two-minute noodles ? No , my mom is really into health foods . It 's an awesome feeling to realise you 're about to change someone 's life forever . You have n't got 2000 dollars . Wait a sec , not one guy asked you out last year ? No . Why would they ? Why ? You 're beautiful , Fi . My mom is beautiful . I 'm just ... You
zone3	I still wear glasses and it 's not ... She was Miss Wirrawee three years in a row . I actually asked her if I should enter this year , but she did n't think that was a good idea . Anyway , I 'm doing really well at school at the moment , so does n't matter . And , you know , a guy will ask me out one day . I just do n't know when . Or who . Which is exciting . Boys are idiots . - Fun idiots . You shall not pass . What 's that smell ? - Jet fuel . - What ? Just a bunch of army planes going somewhere . El , what do you think of Fi ? I love Fi , you know that . She seems so perfect . I guess she thinks I 'm a total loser , huh ? I do n't think she hates you . - Yeah , but ... you know . She lives in that big house . Talks like Mrs Hamilton . Me and my family ... we are
zone3	n't you ask her out ? I do n't know . Girl as pretty as that must get asked out all the time . Did anyone else hear those planes last night ? Yeah . There was six lots of them . They were flying really low . No , there were dozens and dozens . We were counting them , Lee and me . Lee and I . - But seriously , what do you think those planes were doing ? Maybe they were n't even ours . It 's probably the start of World War Three and we do n't even know . Alright , who 's having rabbit ? Is there any chocolate left ? - Sadly , we 're all out . Oh look , I found some . - Do n't be a dickhead . Give it back ! Thank you . Kevin ? - I was gon na give you some . So beautiful out here . I wonder why they call it Hell . I guess cause it 's so wild and untamed and stuff . Right ? Right . Wild is difficult
zone3	's not Hell . People call it that . People stick labels on things . Until nobody can see them for who or what they really are anymore . Hey , what 's going on ? - There 's a bloody snake in my sleeping bag . Are you sure , mate ? I ca n't see anything . What kind of snake was it ? - I did n't look . Lot of redbellies out here . - Are they deadly ? No . Well ... if they bite you . Shake it . The bag , Beyonce . Do n't lift it too high . I got it , I got it ! I was just about to do that myself . Christ , that 's a big one ! Are you alright ? - Yeah . Thanks . I 'm not sleeping in that bag again . Jesus Christ ! - No need to swear . - Kevin , no need to bloody swear . Is it dead ? - Looks dead . Wait ... Nobody 's laughing , Homer . Hey , Fi . Why did
zone3	the snake , of course . You do know that snakes can swim , right ? - No , they can't . - Yeah they can . - Snakes ca n't swim . They do n't have fins . They slither . - They slither through water . - No , they don't . - What about sea snakes ? Oh my God ! I could 've died ! Oh , Fifi ! Can I go home now ? Do we have to go back ? Well , I 'm excited about a hot shower . And a pillow . A pillow would be nice . Let 's do this again . Back here in the same place . - With the same people . - If we can find it again . - We 'll find it again . Let 's keep it quiet or everyone will start coming here and the place will be wrecked in no time . Ladies and gentlemen ... and Homer . To Hell ! - To Hell . - Cheers . - Cheers . Ellie , what 's with your dog ? -
zone3	Where are you parents ? - I do n't know . - Maybe they left a note . - Did they say they were going away ? - What 's the story , El ? - I 've no idea . They should be here . - Let 's ring my parents . - No , ring Homer 's . They 're closer . There 's no dial tone . - What ? What about TV ? Maybe your grandmother got sick so they left ... - And cut the phone lines ? - Some big electrical problem ? - No , they would n't leave Millie to ... Oh , stinks ! - Power must be out . I 'll check the generator . Where 's your laptop ? - Shit ! - Ellie , let 's go to Homer's . - Ellie ... - What ? - Maybe not a good idea . - Stop the car . Let me out ! Mama ! Papa ! Wait , where 's Lee going ? Lee ? What are you doing ? We should n't leave it in the open
zone3	the open . Are you serious ? Homer ? I already tried that . Real quiet out there . - Did you send out a call ? Would n't be safe . No ! I know what you 're thinking and it 's not possible . Absolutely , completely impossible . That kind of stuff just does n't happen here . Not in this country . We got ta be careful . It could be a lot at stake here . She 's right . We 've got to assume something bad has happened . Of course something bad has happened . My dog is dead . - I did n't mean it like that . - Shut up ! Everyone shut up ! Jesus Christ , what is going on ? Kevin 's place was next . I do n't remember who suggested it , but we decided to stay off the main roads . Mom ! Dad ! Mitchell ! Flip ? Flip ! Looks alright . - He always has a bucket of food and some water . Do n't you , boy ? You ca n't
zone3	leave him here ? I 'm not leaving him ! Stop it ! I 'm not leaving him ! He 's got a point . Let 's take Flip to Corrie 's and then we can make another decision depending on what we find there . Agreed ? Flip , let 's go . C'm on . That 's four out of four . The rest of you live in town . Robyn 's house is on Coachman 's Lane . That 's probably the closest . Yeah , you can see most of Wirrawee from the hill at the back . It might tell us something . - Then we go to Robyn 's next . Flip , sit . Stay . Please do n't touch that . - Let 's go up that hill . Something 's going on at the Showground . I think that 's where everyone is . - What about those other lights ? Hospital . Must be using the emergency generators . Maybe we should split up . Split up ? No , we ca n't . We have to stay together .
zone3	Just in case . I 'll take Fi to her house . Lee , you take Robyn to yours . We 'll meet back here at 5 a.m . So we just stay here ? You get to go to the Show . Whose voices are those ? - I do n't know . I think we should go back . - No . Wait . We have to get a better look before we leave . Better look at what , Ellie ? Let 's go ! One of us has to get closer before we go . We got ta see what 's going on . I 'm not leaving Corrie here . - I 'll go . - Ellie ! If anything happens , run . Do not try to escape or you will be shot . Dad ! This is bloody ridiculous . I 've been waiting in this stupid line for 2 hours ! Who do you people think you are ? Hands off me . Are you okay ? Where 's Kevin ? Quick ! They 're coming ! Ellie ... - What ?
zone3	Please ! Please . Come on . Where are they now ? - I do n't know . - Guys ! Kevin ! Oh my God ! What happened to you ? I thought that you 're ahead of me , so I just ... I just ran . Ellie said that if anything was to happen to run . - Oh my God ! - Go ! C'm on , c'm on ... Let 's go . - I hurt my knee . - C'm on , we got ta keep moving . Are you alright ? - No . I cut it . Jesus ! Give me your shirt . Quick . Singlet , it 's better . Quick . Get me a stick or something . Stay here . Ellie , hurry up ! Quick , get back ! - Will this do ? - Yeah , quick . Ellie , they are coming . - Alright . Light it . Light it . Corrie , we got ta get out of here . Get up , c'm on . Ellie , let 's go ! Hang
zone3	. And she looked just as scared . I 'll never forget her . Ellie , we do n't have time . - Come on ! Thank God ! We heard an explosion . - Yeah , that was us . - Are you alright ? - Yeah . Flip ! There he is . Good boy ! Where did all those soldiers come from ? Where did you get this thing ? Wait , where 's Robyn and Lee ? They have n't come back yet . - It 's almost 6 a.m . We were just about to give up on all of you . We have to go and find them then , do n't we ? - Ellie ... Homer , we have to go find them . - It 's daylight now . - I 'm not leaving them . - We 're not leaving them . We 'll come back tonight when it 's safer . Yeah cause there 'll be soldiers crawling all over town by now . I mean ... after what you did . We will find them . Ellie ,
zone3	- Wait , just ... - No , do n't touch me . Sit down over there . - Are you alright ? I 'll get us some food . - Thank you . So , any idea whose army it is ? - We did n't exactly stop to ask . We 'll ask Robyn . She 's good with flags and things like that . All I can say is they are not greek . - It does n't matter who they are , because they 're here . We just got to deal with it . Alright , mate . Calm down . No , seriously , what difference does a flag make ? Fi made this for you . Her house is empty too ? - Yeah . There are soldiers everywhere . We crawled all the way back to Robyn 's . Not bad for a first date . The others told me what happened . El . It 's not your fault . It 's not your fault . It 's theirs . It 's all theirs . You 're changing . - Yeah
zone3	Definitely better . Looks good . Fi 'd always say she 'd be a doctor . You 're gon na have to forgive him sooner or later , you know . He just left us , Ellie . He just ran and left us . I thought he loved me . Do you remember how many hours we used to spend up here ? You mean the tea parties ? We were so innocent back then . And now I ... I feel like we were innocent right up until yesterday . We did n't believe in Santa Claus or anything like that . You know , we believed in other fantasies . We believed we were safe . I guess that was the biggest fantasy of them all , right ? Do you ever think we 'll see Robyn and Lee again ? That 's one of ours ! How many planes do we have ? One less now . How 's this ? I 'm going to Wirrawee with Ellie and we look for Robyn and Lee . You three go back to my place and load up
zone3	back into Wirrawee . What if it was you they 're going back for ? Do n't ask me to go with you . - He 's not . Good , because I 'm not bloody going . Jesus , Kevin . Everything is a risk from now on . We ca n't sit around here forever . The biggest risk is to take no risk . Alright . But if we ca n't stay here where do you want us all to go ? Hell . We 're not taking your teddies . - Not all of them , just one . We ca n't take things like that . - Why ca n't we ? This is n't a picnic , El . We have to start acting like soldiers . One mistake and ... it 's all over . Can we take my mom 's crowns and sashes ? - Yeah , and photos . Do n't forget photos . Geez , we 're gon na need a trailer pretty soon . Look , if you can take teddies , crowns and photos , I might aswell
zone3	and dog food for Flip . Lots of dog food . Write that down . - He can eat rabbit . - What about wire cutters ? Now that 's a great idea . Two T 's . What about guns ? - We 'll take our own guns . Just turn it off . - No , I can fix this . Hang on . The pipe 's burst again . So , we 've got plenty of ammo for the rifles , and a full magazine for that . I got it ! What 's that ? We forgot to have someone on watch . Do n't touch the curtains . Spread out ! Go into different rooms . If you see anything , yell out . But stay hidden . Flip ! Flip , get inside ! It 's here ! Did they see you ? - I do n't know . Homer ! Ellie ! Stay still ! Good thing you 're so skinny . Hey guys , I think it 's coming back . Flairs . They 're marking the house . - Thanks a
zone3	, mate . They know we 're here now . - Of course they know . They saw us through the window . But they did n't know we had guns ! Let 's get out of here . C'm on , let 's get out of here , now ! Go , go , go ... Go , go , move it ! Run ! Run ! - Flip ! Leave him ! - No ! Homer was right . Hell was the only safe place for us now . But first we had to find Robyn and Lee . What 's wrong ? - The Heron Bridge ! Jesus , look at them all . They are coming up from Cobbler 's Bay . I bet you this is one of the first places they captured . It 's probably full of ships right now . Yeah . And our bridge gives them direct access to it . I 've always hated that bridge . Come on , we have to get to Robyn 's house . Robyn ! Ellie ? How did you know it was her
zone3	What was she gon na do , beat us with it ? Ellie , thank God ! - Are you hurt ? - No , no , I 'm fine . Where is Lee ? He 's been shot . Wait here a minute . Someone should go with her . All clear . Let 's go . Robyn . Go , go , go ... Do n't point that thing at me . - This is dr Clement . It 's okay , he 's my dentist . He works across the street . - Dr Clement , it 's me . It 's Robyn . - Quiet down , the lot of you . Do n't you know there 's a bloody war going on ? Shine that here . How is it ? - He was lucky . The bullet went right through . Thank you . - You picked the hell of a weekend to go camping . We heard the planes , but we did n't see any ... That 's how they did it . Freighter planes and container ships . Took all the
zone3	said there was some kind of explosion at the airfield . None of us paid much attention to it . Next thing you know , they are rolling across the bridge in their tanks and trucks , rounding up everyone , taking them all to the Showground . Lee 's whole family . Yours too . And mine ? - Yours I do n't know anything about . What about my parents ? George and Martha Yannos . Did they ever get their teeth fixed ? - No . Then how the hell would I know who they are ? - I was just asking , doc . I 've been hiding in the closet for three straight days , living in my own piss and shit , just waiting for them to come and find me . I thought I 'll finally snap when I saw you carrying Lee in here . - You carried him ? - Yeah , I had to . If his leg starts to hurt , you got ta give him another shot . Wait , you 're not staying with us ? Look
zone3	here for Lee , alright ? I 've done enough . I 've got ta go . Wait , dr Clement . Are there any others out there ? Like us ? Oh , yeah . I 've seen few people try to do some things . Try to be heroes . Apparently one group even tried to blow up Heron bridge . To stop all those bloody convoys coming up from Cobbler 's Bay . They all paid the price . Are you okay ? I think we should get a vehicle . - We always had two . First one you dump somewhere . Second one is a getaway car . - So , you had practice at this ? - Great . I 'll just go get mom 's car , park it at the front and ask soldiers to look the other way , shall I ? Sorry . I 'm just ... tired . How about if we get something silent ? Golf carts , shopping trollies ... - Prams , pushers ... Wheelchairs ? - Yeah , could you ride in a wheelchair ?
zone3	it hurts . - Wait ... What if we 're going about this the wrong way ? What do you mean ? We 're thinking of quiet sneaky little things , right ? What if we went to the other extreme ? Rock up in something so indestructible that it would n't matter who saw us . Such as ? Shit ! Let 's go ! Are you alright ? - Hang on . - What ? - I ca n't climb up there . - Get in the bucket . - In this ? - Yeah . I thought you said you could drive this thing . I said I can drive a tractor . Get in . Oh shit . Drive , Ellie . Drive ! Take this , shoot back at them ! - No , I wo n't do it . This is no time to get religious . - I said no ! You 're bleeding ! Go ! I hope Homer 's got a getaway car . - I hope he remembers where to meet us . Even Homer knows how to find a
zone3	Lord , forgive us our sins ... Hold on ! I think we lost one of them . We lost a tire ! You 're driving in circles ! - I 'm doing the best I can ! You are dangerous . - That 's what my driving instructor said . He 's still chasing us ! How do you dump the rubbish ? - That switch , I think . Who is dangerous now ? - Do you think any of them got hurt ? Do n't worry . God will understand . Where 's Homer ? He 's supposed to be here . Where is he ? Maybe he got caught . We have to keep going , get out of town . No . Ellie , we 've got to wait for Homer . How long do you think it 's gon na be before they send another vehicle ? Or even a helicopter ? We have to leave now ! Sorry I 'm late . I forgot where the bloody church was . Why are we stopping ? - I have to rest . Move over
zone3	only I ... Just do n't , okay ? This is Chris Lang 's house . Oh , that guy is such a weirdo . - He 's a genius , Kevin . - He 's a bloody stoner . - Stoners are people too . I do n't really care as long as there 's a soft bed in there . And maybe a toothbrush . - I 've got a spare toothbrush . Chris says his father was born on the corner of Straight and Narrow . And that he was born in the other end of town . The day before it all began , mom and dad left for Saudi Arabia . So , here I am . Alone . And the power goes off at like nine or ten . Nine . Yeah , nine . So I think , okay . I better ring up and find out what 's going on . I 'm an idiot . The phones are down too . So , I 'm so bent by this point . Like , I 'm really stoned . I 'm baked
zone3	dad , get this right , dad has locked the car and taken the keys with him . I think he 's such a wanker for doing that . You know , like he did n't even trust me with a car for one week . So now , I have to walk to the Ramseys ' place . And it is far . Like , take what you think is far , time it by like 10 , say . And that 's how far it was . And when I get there nobody is at home . And it 's like ... oh , great ! Because the next place is even further . Anyway , I walk around the corner . And I can see the Ramseys in their truck . They 'd hit a tree . But that 's not what has killed them . They 've been shot . They 've been shot ? ! Like no one gets shot . And I mean , heaps of times . Mr Ramsey , Mrs Ramsey , even baby Jessica 's been shot . So , I
zone3	really weird shit , or this is n't your typical day in Wirrawee . Anyway , I 've just been by myself ever since , really . Just chilling out . It 's been nice . Nice . How funny are dogs ? How does it feel to get shot ? I did n't even feel it at first . But by the time I got back to the restaurant , it felt like my whole leg was on fire . Like somebody was pulling a barbed wire throught it . They wrecked your restaurant ? Yeah . I used to hate that place . Working there , being there . Just living there . I felt like I was in prison or something . But you know , I helped make that place what it was . So when someone smashes a window , they are smashing glass that I hand-polished a thousand times . Or they are tearing curtains that my mom and I hand-stitched . You get a certain type of attachment to the place . It 's weird . Takes on its own kind of beauty
zone3	to geography . I should go back and check on Chris . - Chris ? Yeah , I left him on watch . Sorry . Chris . Chris ? Hey ! Get up . Get up ! Are you awake now , you little shit ? - Geez Ellie , take it easy . - Take it easy ? - Yeah , I just shut my eyes for a second . Do n't you understand how it 's all changed , Chris ? Do n't you get it ? - Yeah , I do . I do get it . - If we take it easy any more ... We might aswell shoot each other now and get it over with . Okay I get it . I do . I 'm sorry . I 'm really really sorry . Must be that time of the month . Shoot me . - What are you doing ? - Go on Chris , shoot me ! - I do n't wan na shoot you . - You ca n't kill me while I 'm awake ? - Geez Ellie , it
zone3	you 're sorry ! People are dying out there , Chris . Families have been split apart . We 've seen homes blown to pieces . Yet you 're up here having a fuckin vacation . So , go on . Do n't wait for me to fall asleep . Buck up , be a man , look me in the eye and pull the trigger . Ellie , please ... - No ? - What are you doing ? Do you know what penalty is for falling asleep at your post ? Do you know what they used to do ? - No , Ellie ... Ellie ! Put the gun down , please . I said I 'm sorry . Please ! He risked all our lives . Ellie . It 's Chris . It 's just Chris . How long have I been asleep ? About 16 hours . How 's Chris ? Still pretty shaken . You gave him a hell of a fright , you know . I 'll apologize when he wakes up . I promise . Actually , he wants to apologize to
zone3	a little overboard about it , but you were right . You 're a good mate , Corrie . And you 're a bloody nutcase . - Good book ? - Better than the movie . Yeah , books usually are . The general repeated his claim that the Coalition nations can no longer support their booming populations . And that Australia must be made to share her vast land and extensive natural resources with her less fortunate neighbors . In this way , general hopes the invasion will balance the economic scales within the region and eventually lead to a new era of peace and stability . Meanwhile , more than half a million Coalition forces are pouring into Australia though three captured ports . These ports have now being identified as Townsville , Port Headland and Cobbler 's Bay . - You heal well . - I have good genes . There 's something I 've been meaning to ask you . You know at Chris ' house the other day when I was ... playing with your hair and then ... - Yeah , all right .
zone3	thought you might have forgotten . What , do you think I do that stuff so often that I forget about it ? But you 've hardly spoken to me since then . - I 'm just confused . - About me ? Yeah , about you , about us . About this war . About this mess that we found ourselves in . The truth is , half the time I have no idea what I 'm doing . So then , I do these things , and they do n't always mean what I think they mean . Do you know what I mean ? No , I 've no idea what you mean . - Okay ... Look , it meant something then and it does mean something now , but ... I do n't think it means what you 'd wanted it to mean . - Do you just not like me ? - No , Lee . I like you , okay ? I like you very much . But right now , you 're driving me crazy . I do n't know why I
zone3	wanted to do is hold him and tell him that everything is gon na be alright . I just did n't know if it was . None of us did . All we could say for sure was that for now , we were free . But we 've done nothing to earn our freedom . Not yet , anyway . The way I see it , these are our choices . One : we can sit here and do nothing . Come out when the war 's over . I do n't know about you guys ... but I 'm not so good at doing nothing . Two : we can all try to be heroes . Rescue our families from the Showground 's . But like dr Helpfull said , we 'll probably pay the price . Or three : we can go out there , at night . Guerilla style . Using hit and run tactics and take back Wirrawee . Maybe even help win this thing . - Yeah , you 're right . We were born here . We know this country better than they
zone3	Plant traps , ambush them , pick them off . - You 're talking about murder . - It 's not murder if it 's in a war . What about the Bible , " thou shall not kill " . What about that ? David killed Goliath . - That does n't apply in a situation that is a metaphor . Do you think it 's fair , do you ? - No . - Just let them walk in , take everything they want and our parents worked so hard for ? No Kevin , I do n't think it 's fair . I do n't think it 's fair at all . Are you in or are you out ? Well , I feel like I should be out . But I ca n't stop thinking about the coincidence that ... from all the weekends that we could 've chosen to go camping , we chose that weekend . God spared us for a reason . And I think he wants us to do something . So I will help you Homer , but I 'm not
zone3	to death , but ... I think we have to fight back anyway . We 'll never sleep again if we don't . - We 'll never sleep again if we did . - What are you chicken , Chris ? - You 'd know all about that , would n't you ? There 's nothing chicken about staying alive , mate . We 're not even trained for this stuff . What would our parents say ? They 'd say the most important thing is our safety . They would n't want us dead in exchange for them being alive . I suppose when the time comes , I 'll do what I have to do . What worries me though is that ... I ca n't guarantee that I 'm not gon na pack up under pressure . I 'm so scared and ... I think that I might just stand there and scream . None of us knows how we 're gon na react when shit hits the fan . You 've done alright so far . Well , for a townie . We have to do
zone3	. And do nothing . I 'm different to all of you . I have blood on my hands . I ca n't tell if what I did was right or wrong . I 'd like to think it was to save my friends , or as part of some noble crusade to save my country . Really it just comes down to the fact that I valued my life over theirs . How many people is it okay to kill in order to keep me alive ? At what point do we lose our souls , if we have n't already ? In the end I think we just have to trust our instincts . After all , it is all we have left , is n't it ? What do your instincs tell you ? That it 's time to go to war . What are we gon na do ? Blow it up ? Cobbler 's Bay is one of their key ports . And this bridge is the only way in or out . It 's the key to everything . If they ca n't resupply
zone3	've got sentries . - We have to find the way to distract them . Remember what dr Clement said ? About how other people tried to blow up that bridge before ? Amateurs . Couple of years ago me and some mates came up with the way to take this bridge down . Just for fun . That 's hardly reassuring , knowing your mates . Can you drive a petrol tanker ? - Hurry up . - Okay . Sorry . - Big one ? - The big one . There ! They are there . In the window . Wait ! - What ? - Can I do it ? I 've always wanted to smash a window . - One more . - Fi ! Just ... Do it ! Fi , run ! Stop ! Turn around ! Do not move ! - Guys , are you there ? - We 're all set . We can see you . Do n't come any closer . Wait there till we get the word from Homer . Lee and me are almost there . - Lee
zone3	the position too . I can see 10 soldiers on the bridge . We 've only got about 15 minutes before the next convoy comes along . We 'll call you when we 're ready . - Okay honey , we 'll be waiting . Did you just call him ' honey ' ? - Homer . I called him ' Homer ' . No , you just called him ' honey ' . - I didn't . - Yes you did , I heard you . It may have sounded like ' honey ' but I definitely said ' Homer ' . - Go . Go . - You got ta hiss like a snake . No , no , like a snake . So , princess Fifi has the hots for a rough as guts Homer . Have you kissed him ? - Would you mind if I had ? Me ? Are you serious ? Of course not . I just know that you two are close . - No , never like that . - Okay , good . Well then , yes I have .
zone3	do n't wan na know . Do n't tell me . It 's kinda gross . - He 's a great kisser . - Great . Now I know . But he 's so down on himself . He 's got this weird thing about my parents being lawyers . And he always used to joke about it . But I do n't think he 's really joking at all . Jesus , Fi , how long did it take to figure that out ? - What do you mean ? You know the kind of guys he knocks about . They 're just ... more at home hanging out at the pub than playing croquet with your parents . My parents do n't play croquet . Ellie . Ellie ! Fi ! Behind you ! Homer is like two people . He 's so confident with a group , and then he 's supershy with me . I just do n't understand . Ellie ? If I could understand Homer I 'm sure I 'd understand all guys . Like Lee ? How did you know about that ?
zone3	this is worse than recess . They ca n't hear us . Homer , you have to go now . - But we 're still not ready . There are soldiers creeping up behind tanker and Ellie 's not answering me . Ellie , pick up . Just think about it . The eight of us are living out in the bush . And the entire world is completely turned upside down . I 'd just hate to be responsible for ruining whatever little good we did have by Lee and me having a falling out . Look , Ellie . I 'm no expert on relationships or anything . But I do know that you have this tendency to reason everything through all the time , and I just think the future is the future . It has to take care of itself . And by the way , it 's Lee and ' I ' . Get out of the truck ! Move ! Drive ! Here goes the brilliant plan . Ellie , I 'm so sorry I turned it off . - Does n't matter .
zone3	. - You were to bring it . No , you were to bring the lighter . I do n't have it . Christ , the soldiers ! Where the hell is Kevin going ? Robyn , we ca n't get to you . - Do n't worry about us , just go ! You guys take this one . Corrie , you 're with me . Run Homer , let 's go ! Hurry up , they 're coming ! C'm on ! Kevin ! Corrie ? Corrie ! Get away ! Come on . Wait ! Gosh ! It was so much bigger than I expected . - That 's the biggest joint I 've ever lit . Did you see the bridge ? Corrie ! Oh my God , what happened ? She got shot as we were driving away . I ca n't ... I ca n't stop the bleeding . We 'll take her to go see dr Clement . He can fix her the same way that he fixed Lee . - She needs a hospital , Fi . - I 'm gon na
zone3	Hey ! You have to leave me . No , I 'm not leaving you . - She 's right . It sounds cruel , but the only thing to do is ring the bell and run . - What ? - No ! - No I ca n't leave her . I won't . - We have to be rational about this . If we take her to the hospital , we will get caught . No , I do n't give a shit what 's rational . Alright ? Corrie is our mate . She is our mate . And I ... I love her . I 'm taking her in . I 'm staying with her . I 'm staying . Good luck , mate . I 'll come get you when you 're better . Okay ? Pinky swear . We 've hit them . Hit them hard . They are gon na be coming after us now with everything they 've got . And they did come after us . For three weeks now , we 've seen ... dozens of planes and helicopters and
zone3	. Which means Corrie and Kevin have told them nothing . A month ago , we were just an average bunch of teenagers . Studying for school and complaining about our parents . Now we 're soldiers . Trapped behind enemy lines and fighting to survive . We wo n't run . We wo n't hide . We 'll fight and keep fighting . And never give up . Until this war is finally won .

" Born some 500 years
zone3	to manhood in a town vanished long ago . For nearly three decades , he would see nothing of the world beyond . The tales say he was the son of a king , raised in a palace with every imaginable luxury . He was called Siddhartha Gautama , a prince among a clan of warriors . " When I was a child , " he said , " I was delicately brought up , most delicately . A white sunshade was held over me day and night to protect me from cold , heat , dust , dirt , and dew . My father gave me three lotus ponds : One where red lotuses bloomed , one where white lotuses bloomed , one where blue lotuses bloomed . " Thefatherwantshim tobe a king ; wants him to conquer the world and to be the emperor of India , which at that time was 16 different kingdoms . And it was predicted that he would be able to conquer wherever he wanted if he remained as a king . So the father was creating this artificial environment to coddle him

I was surrounded by beautiful women . " " During the rainy season , I stayed in my palace , where I was entertained by musicians and dancing girls . I never even thought of leaving . " When he was 16 , his father , drawing him tighter into palace life , married him to his cousin . It was n't long before they fell in love . Hewastotallyinlove with her .

But at a very early age , at a time before he could remember anything , at a time before there was conceptual thought , he already suffered the worst kind of loss that one could suffer . Suddenly and mysteriously , his mother died when he was a week old . So something tragic happened , you know , right at the beginning . That might be what it takes to become a Buddha ? is that you have to suffer on such a primitive level . [BELL_TOLLING] GERE:29yearsold , profoundly troubled , Siddhartha was determined to comprehend the nature of suffering . He resolved to leave the palace . His wife had just given birth to a baby boy . Siddhartha called him Rahula , " fetter . " Henameshisson

A lamp of scented oil lit up . His wife lay sleeping on a bed strewn with flowers , cradling their newborn son in her arms . He gazed from the threshold , deep in thought . " If I take my wife 's hand from my son 's head and pick him up and hold him in my arms , it will be painful for me to leave . " He turned away and climbed down to the palace courtyard . His beloved horse Kanthaka was waiting . As he rode toward the city 's northern wall , he leapt high into the air . Mara , the tempter god of desire , was waiting . " You are destined , " Mara told him , " to rule a great empire . Go back , and worldly power will be yours . " Siddhartha refused . Heleftgriefand probably

And this is one of the hard truths of human existence : in order to gain anything , you must first lose everything . GERE : Siddharthawasalone in the world for the first time . On the bank of a nearby river , he drew his sword . " Although my father and stepmother were grieving with tears on their faces , " he said , " I cut off my hair . I put on the yellow robes and went forth from home into homelessness . I had been wounded by the enjoyment of the world , and I had come out longing to obtain peace .

[SPEAKINGNATIVELANGUAGE] GERE : Forcenturies , the Vedic rituals had commanded respect for the gods and inspired conviction . But by Siddhartha 's time , the rituals no longer spoke to the spiritual needs of many Indians , leaving a spiritual vacuum and a sense of foreboding .

GERE : Siddharthajoined thousands of searchers like himself , renunciants : men and even a few women who had renounced the world , embracing poverty and celibacy , living on the edge , just as spiritual seekers still do in India today . Now , atthistimeinIndia , there were lots of renunciants out there . It 's a flourishing renunciant tradition . There are many different people who have given everything up and practice austerities and meditate in order to escape from the cycle of death and rebirth . The notion of reincarnation is something that 's part of Indian culture , part of Indian civilization , part of Indian religion , that was there long before the Buddha
zone3	, the problem that the Buddha faced . GERE : Sufferingdidn'tbegin at birth and finish with death . Suffering was endless , unless it was possible to find a way out , become enlightened , become a Buddha . Inhistime , therewas a sense of death not being final but of death leading inexorably to rebirth and of beings , suffering beings , bound to the wheel of death and rebirth . BROWN : Itis saidthat Siddhartha had lived many lives before this one , As countless animals ... innumerable human beings ... and even gods ; across four incalculable ages , the sacred texts say , and many aeons , experiencing life in all its different forms . **25;1441;TOOLONG , many aeons , sometimes as a human being , sometimes as an animal , but then gradually using his practice , becoming more higher and higher and deeper , deeper .

It could take them , you know , a billion lifetimes if they are very stubborn , you know . AndbecomingaBuddha , becoming enlightened , is the only way of getting out of the continual cycle of death and rebirth . Now , rebirth here is n't the popular notion that , you know , in my past life , I was Cleopatra floating down the Nile or Napoleon . It 's as if every life is going through junior high school again , over and over and over . GERE : Withtheauthorityof the priests worn thin and wisdom seekers like Siddhartha roaming the countryside , holy men emerged , teaching their own spiritual disciplines . Siddhartha apprenticed himself to one of them , a celebrated guru who taught that true knowledge could never come from ritual practice alone . It was necessary to look within . " You may stay here with me , " the guru told him . " A wise person can

Theteachersof thetimeare already teaching forms of yoga and meditation , teaching that the self-reflective capacity of the mind can be put to use to tame the mind , to tame the passions . That was already established in India . And there were probably so many schools of yoga and meditation in those days , just as there are now . ? Ohh ? [CONTINUES_TO_HOLD_NOTE] [SPEAKINGNATIVELANGUAGE] [CHANTING] [CHANTING_CONTINUES] GERE : Althoughyogaappears to focus on controlling the body , it is in fact an ancient , spiritual discipline , a form of meditation , harnessing the energies of the body to tame the mind .

Allkindsof trancestates are possible through meditation . If you hold the mind , if you concentrate the mind on a single object , you know , be it a word or a candle flame or a sound , it 's possible

He was a super student , doing these practices , taking them to their limit , and no matter what he did in these practices , he was still stuck in the pain that he set out with . Heascendsto thesevery rarified states of consciousness , but it 's not permanent , and it does not bring penetrating truth into the nature of reality . So these become a temporary escape from the problem of existence , but they do n't solve the problem . [MAN_CHANTING] ? ? GERE : Siddharthaapprenticed himself to another popular guru , but the results were the same . " The thought occurred to me , " he said later , " this practice does not lead to direct knowledge , to deeper awareness . " Disenchanted , he left this master too . Siddhartha continued to drift south , still searching for the answer to his questions : Why do human beings suffer ? Is there any escape ? He'stryingandtryingand searching and searching , and he

Siddhartha fell in with five other ascetics and soon was outdoing them in mortifying the flesh , subjecting his body to extremes of hardship and pain . Thebodyrepresents a fundamental problem . Old age brings a decrepitude to the body . Sickness brings pain and suffering to the body . And death is ultimately the cessation of the functioning of the body . So there was a sense that if you could punish the body sufficiently , you could escape its influence . You could transcend some of the limitations that the body seemed to impose . Theasceticpursuesthe truth by taking the requirements of survival down to the absolute minimum possible : barely enough food to stay alive , no protection from the elements , no heat , sit in the cold , sit in the rain , meditate fiercely for all the hours of awakening .

[SPEAKINGNATIVELANGUAGE] GERE:emaciated , exhausted , Siddhartha punished himself for six years , trying to put an end to the cravings that beset him . Hetortureshimself , trying to destroy anything within himself that he sees as bad . The spiritual traditions of that time said you can be liberated if you eliminate everything that 's human : you know , everything that 's coarse and vulgar , every bit of anger , every bit of desire . If you - - you know , if you wipe that out with force of will , then you can go into some kind of transcendental state . and the Buddha tried all that , and he became , you know , the most anorectic of the anorectic ascetics . He was eating one grain of rice per day . He was drinking his own urine . He was standing on one foot . He was sleeping on nails . He did it all
zone3	, " Siddhartha said . " my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine or bamboo stems . My spine stood out like a string of beads . My ribs jutted out like the jutting rafters of an old , abandoned building . The gleam of my eyes appeared to be sunk deep in my eye sockets , like the gleam of water deep in a well . My scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter gourd shriveled and withered in the heat and wind . " Whathewastryingtodo was pushing his body to the most extreme that he could . But then he realized that from that , he can not gain what he wants . Trying to torture the body , the body becomes too much . The whole attention is given to the body , nothing else . Hesurrenderedhimself completely to the hard training that he was given . And what he discovered , having tried this completely for many years , was that he had not answered his question . It had n't worked . he was on the verge of death , dying ,
zone3	day when he was young and sat by the river with his father and the perfection of the world as it was simply gave itself to him . BROWN : Yearsbefore , when Siddhartha was a small boy , his father , the king , had taken him to a spring planting festival . while he watched the ceremonial dancing , he looked down at the grass . He thought about the insects and their eggs - - destroyed as the field was planted . He was overwhelmed with sadness . Onegreattaprootof Buddhism is compassion , which is the deep affection that we feel for everything because we 're all in it together - - be it other human beings , other animals , the planet as a whole , the creatures of this planet , the trees and rivers of this planet . Everything is connected . BROWN : Itwasabeautiful day . His mind drifted . As if by instinct , he crossed his legs in the yoga pose of meditation . And the natural world paid him homage . As the sun moved through the sky , the

And the fabric of this world - - despite the fact that it can seem so horrible , the underlying fabric of this world actually is that joy that he recovered . That was his great insight . " But , " he says , " i ca n't sustain a feeling of joy like this if i do n't take any food , so i better eat something . " And then at that moment , a village maiden mysteriously appears carrying a bowl of rice porridge . Andshesaidtohim , " here , eat . " that moment of generosity and release when he accepted the rice was a decision towards life . It was what in the Christian tradition might be called " grace , " that you can not do it completely on your own . And in Christianity , the grace comes from the divine . In the story

" **25;1468;TOOLONG whenever I remember that story , it makes me so happy because I see the heart of Buddha as the person he was , like the Siddhartha . This dish was the dish he used to be fed by his stepmother , rice pudding . He was missing that so much . and then he remembered maybe further and further , and he remembered about his wife , about his son . And the deepest emotions that he had suppressed , they overpower . They came up . They were still there . And he had a feeling of missing . He had a feeling of seeing his son and a feeling of being near his loved one's . They were so powerful . Oh , this must have soaked his whole entire being . Hewasactuallyanutter failure . He had been clinging to the path of asceticism . And when he took the food , what followed was a return of his original question . Life is painful . Life involves change

" He has forsaken his spiritual practice . He has become extravagant . " Butthemanwho willbecome the Buddha realizes that extreme deprivation is n't the way to go . We can live as normal human beings . We can eat and drink . And , in fact , we kind of need to eat and drink and be normal human beings in order to break through , in order to attain the kind of realization that he was looking for . GERE : Siddharthahadput his faith in two gurus . They had n't helped him . He had punished his mind and body . That had almost killed him . Now he knew what he must do . to find the answer to his questions , he would look within and trust himself .

GERE : TheBuddha'sanalysis of suffering came in the form of what have come to be called " the Four Noble Truths . " Thereisno commandmentsor anything . The first Noble Truth is that there is suffering in this world . Generally , this " suffering " has been mistranslated . " Suffering " isnotentirely accurate to the word that the Buddha probably used . It means something closer to " dissatisfaction " - - that , you know , we 're never quite happy , and if we are , that 's gone in an instant , anyhow . Andhesaysthatthis suffering , this unsatisfactoriness , does n't arise by itself ; it has causes . Our own mind causes it
zone3	cause , the Third Noble Truth makes an astonishing claim . Youreallycanbefree of suffering by understanding the cause of suffering . But nobody tells you that , and so that was a huge announcement . GERE : Theproblem , Buddha taught , is desire , how to live with the confused and entangling desires of our own minds . Peopleoftenmisunderstand Buddhism as saying : " In order to wipe out suffering , you have to wipe out desire . " If that was what the Buddha was saying , then where does the desire for enlightenment fit in , you know ? The Buddha 's saying : " Be smart about your desires . " GERE : WiththeFourthand final Noble Truth , the Buddha laid out a series of instructions for his disciples to follow , a way of leading the mind to enlightenment called " the Noble Eightfold Path , " the cultivation of moral discipline , mindfulness , and wisdom . Theyare , as Iliketothink of them , a set of possible recipes that you can try on your own life and see which one makes the best

Hundreds came to hear him and became disciples too . Many were wealthy merchants or their sons , living just five miles away in a thriving trading center on the Ganges , the holy city of Benares . [BELL_CLANGING] [MEN_SINGING] Today Benares is the most sacred city in all of India , as it has been for millennia . Even before the time of the Buddha , pilgrims came here to worship their gods and bathe in the holy river of heaven . Youseepeoplepurifying themselves bathing in the Ganges . You see priests performing rituals . You see corpses , because that 's the best place to end one 's life . So you see going on there a great range of religious activity , and much of it of the type that does go back to the Buddha 's time . [MAN_SINGING] GERE : Manyof today'ssacred ceremonies on the Ganges echo the ancient practices of the
zone3	day , only the Brahmans could mediate between the gods and men . Only they could conduct the holy rituals that were said to preserve the universe itself . The Brahman priests stood at the pinnacle of a rigid social hierarchy : a sacred system of caste . Beneath them were the warriors , the caste to which the Buddha belonged . Below them were farmers . at the bottom were the servants and , still lower , outcastes . Thosesocialgroupsare not merely social conventions , but rather , they 're hardwired into the nature of the universe . You 're supposed to stay in that group , and the survival of society depends upon your continuing to perform the function associated with that social status . GERE : Castewasirrelevant to the Buddha . So were priestly rituals to preserve the universe . His teachings focused on the universe within . TheBuddhasaidyou couldbe from any caste . What makes you noble is if you understand reality , you know , if you 're a good person . If you 're a wise person , then you 're noble . [SOFT_INSTRUMENTAL_MUSIC]

IttooktheBuddhamany , many years to find his way . But he did n't want it to be so hard for people , and so he established a community who could live together and help one another . GERE : Inaceremonyevoking the beginning of the Buddha 's own spiritual journey , fledgling monks of all ages say good-bye to their families and homes and join the Sangha . [CHANTING] [CHILDREN_REPEATING_CHANT] Igoto therefugeofthe Buddha , I go to the refuge of the Dharma , and I go to the refuge of the Sangha . **27;1523;TOOLONG theSanghais an embodiment of Buddha 's experience and wisdom . What happens if people practice this thing ? Are they truly happy or not ? Are they joyful or not ? So I think Buddha wanted us to lead a perfect example of his teaching : an alive teaching , a teaching that walks , a teaching that can talk , a teaching that can
zone3	a living example of Buddha 's teaching . [ALL_CHANTING_SOFTLY] GERE:thefirstSanghawas a radical institution , open to people of every caste and , remarkable for the times in which the Buddha lived , to both men and women . The Buddha was part of a culture deeply suspicious of women . Theattitudetowardswomen at the time was very critical , and many things were impossible for them . So that was a very revolutionary thing to do that in that times of India . GERE : Byordainingwomenas nuns , the Buddha gave women the chance to escape the drudgery of daily life . [BELL_GONGS] Life was so hard for most women that entering the Sangha was a liberation , as we know from their ecstatic , heart-rending poems . " So freed ! So freed ! So thoroughly freed am I - - from my pestle , my shameless husband , and his sunshade making , my moldy old pot with its water-snake smell . Aversion and passion I cut with a chop . Having come to the foot of a tree , I meditate , absorbed in the bliss . '
zone3	the Buddha taught , could be found in the fleeting moment through the practice of meditation . The Buddha showed his followers how to come to terms with their own rolling thoughts and desires by paying attention to them , by becoming aware , becoming mindful . As an ancient poem counsels : " Like an archer , an arrow , the wise man steadies his trembling mind , a fickle and restless weapon . " Manytimes , ourmindisnot peaceful enough . So we realize that perhaps we need to understand more about mind itself and how to balance the emotions , how to balance our mind , and try to cultivate more happiness . Thedifficultiescomefrom within . One experiences unexpected things from one 's mind : the most dangerous skeptical doubts , doubts about one 's self , doubts about the Buddha . Physical is - - we can get from - - [CHUCKLES] from the food and from the supplement of vitamins and - - yeah , and for the mind , this is the only way we have to ... only medicine . [CHUCKLES] Meditationisnotabout getting rid
zone3	of jealousy . Even while becoming a monk , often we experience angers ; [CHUCKLES] it happens . And it often happens when people start teasing you , like , " shaven bald-head person . " But it gives a good chance for us to realize that , " Okay , let 's see , this anger arises . What is it ? " What most often happens in our ordinary life is that whenever we experience these emotions , we get stuck into it . It starts twisting us . But Buddhism is going through inside it and getting out of it peacefully . And I think that gives us more joy . And that makes human life more full , more round . It 's not like - - we are not living a partial truth , but it 's like the whole of things together . Ittakestimetocomprehend this . and then by practicing again and again , the practitioner becomes very balanced , and one reaches the state of very strong equanimity , equanimity towards the physical and mental objects . And this is the base camp

Taking a lamp , I enter my cell ; thinking of sleep , I sit on my bed . I touch the wick . the lamp goes out : Nirvana . My mind is freed . " GERE : " Themindis as restless as a monkey , " the Buddha taught . Who you are , what you think of as your " self , " is constantly changing ... like a river , endlessly flowing , One thing today , another tomorrow . There'swaterin ariver , then there 's water in a glass , and then the water is back in the air , and then it 's back in the river . The water 's there , but what is it ? That 's a way to think about the self in Buddhism . one moment you 're angry . The next moment you 're laughing . Who are you
zone3	grass are spun into a rope . A trickling stream turns into a river . " Theselfcomes , and the self goes . Simply notice how from one moment to another , your self is actually not as much the same as we think it is . WhattheBuddharealizesis that if we can get rid of this fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the self based on egotism , we wo n't cling to things ; we wo n't screw up everything we do because we 're thinking about it in the wrong way . Onceyoustopcenteringyour feelings about your feelings on your self , what naturally arises is simple compassion : compassion for your own suffering , compassion for the suffering of others . ? ? [GENTLE_NOTES] GERE : Eventhemostabstract of the Buddha 's teachings had a practical , ethical dimension . Compassion , the Buddha taught , comes from understanding impermanence , transience , flow : how one thing passes into another , how everything and everyone is connected . BROWN : " Whenthisis , that is . From the arising of this comes the arising of that . When
zone3	cessation of this comes the cessation of that . " Thisisalwaysconnected to that . Everything is connected to everything else . You never live by yourself . You live always within a family , a society , or culture . You constantly interact with other people all the time . So our happiness depends on their happiness as well . How can we be happy if we are the only one happy in - - on , you know , just an island of happiness within an ocean of misery ? Of course , that 's not possible . GERE : Compassionstirredthe Buddha to send his monks out into the community . Sworn to chastity and poverty , they wandered the roads , bringing the Buddha 's teachings into the world . " Go forth , monks , for the happiness of the many , out of compassion for the world . There are beings whose eyes have little dust on them , who will perish if they do not hear the teaching . But if they hear the teaching , they will gain liberation . " Themonksexistbybegging . we

Then you ca n't eat from noon until dawn the next day . Then you have to go out and get another lunch . And then in exchange for lunch , you give a lecture , unless they say , " we do n't want to hear about it . " Then you do n't . But that 's the only thing - - but that forces you to interact with the lay community . Andifyou'renot serving them , if you 're not doing something useful for them , they wo n't put anything in your bowl , and that will be the end of your community . GERE : TheBuddhahimself wandered across northeast India , teaching and gathering new disciples everywhere he went . You did n't have to become a monk or a nun to become a Buddhist . The Buddha 's teachings were for everyone . [UP-TEMPO_PERCUSSIVE_MUSIC] ? ? BROWN : " Everythingis burning . What is burning

We may not know it , but we 're on fire , and we have to put that fire out . We 're burning with desire , all right ? We 're burning with craving . Everything - - everything about us is out of control . TheBuddhagoesontotalk about The Three Poisons , greed and anger and ignorance , and how The Three Poisons are what is making the fire , and the way out of doing this is not to deny The Three Poisons but to recognize that if you turn them around , you come to their opposites . Instead of greed , you have generosity . Instead of anger , you have compassion . And instead of ignorance , you have wisdom . GERE : " Icangive my teachings in brief ,
zone3	detail . It is those who understand that are hard to find . " Therearestoriesofpeople coming to the Buddha and saying : " I am leaving your teaching because you have not told me about whether there is a life after death or whether there is another world . " And the Buddha says , " did I ever say that I would give you the answer to these things ? " " No , lord , you did n't . " " Why do you think that I never said that I would give you the answer to these things ? Because these are not the things that you need to know . The thing that you need to know is how to deal with suffering , because at this very moment , what made you ask that question was suffering . " GERE : TheBuddhawas , above all , a pragmatist . he did not expect his followers to agree with everything he said . He encouraged them to debate and argue , to challenge him . Buddhasaid , " Myfollowers should not accept my teaching out of
zone3	himself , in order to get final enlightenment , need hard work . So investigate based on reason , through logical investigation . If something contradict , in Buddha 's own words , then we have the right to reject that . GERE : AstheBuddhagathered more and more followers , stories spread of his miracles , which mixed the marvelous with the mundane . BROWN : Onestorytellshow 500 pieces of firewood split at the Buddha 's command . In another , a mad elephant charged wildly down a street , forcing everyone to flee . Only the Buddha remained , quietly waiting . The elephant , overcome by the Buddha 's radiant kindness , knelt before him , and the Buddha patted his leathery trunk . Because miracle is something you can not understand . so now I think that within this century , we may find some new ideas or new facts . so far , we spent all our energy and time for research on matter , not internal world . This skull , a small space , but lot of mysterious things still there . Thegreatfieldofknowledge is
zone3	I mean , it 's a tiny - - it 's a speck . And the - - the universe is what we do n't know , and it will always be that way . However much we find out , it will still be that way , because the unknown is vastly - - it 's unspeakably greater than anything we will ever know . BROWN : Inoneofthemost storied miracles , the Buddha strode on a jeweled walkway suspended in midair while streams of water spouted and flames flashed from his body , shooting out to the very edge of the universe . And as the Buddha sat on a lotus flower giving his teachings , he replicated himself , filling the sky with multitudes of Buddhas for all to see and wonder . Dowebelievethatliterally ? Does it matter whether we believe it literally ? What many of those miraculous stories are about is the sheer wonder of it all . The very fact that the whole of unknown time and space has led down to this - - led to this very moment when we 're sitting here
zone3	each other is utterly miraculous . Sittingherein aroom , having had a cup of coffee , having taken it out of a beautiful blue-and-white porcelain mug , what could be more miraculous than that ? Everyday life around us is already so implausible and so glorious , that what need for further miracles ? And that 's the teaching of the Buddha . That 's the miraculous teaching of the Buddha . GERE : Violence , theBuddha taught , always leads to more violence . " To the slayer comes a slayer . to the conqueror comes a conqueror . He who plunders is plundered in turn . " War was endemic in the Buddha 's age , ravaging northeast India again and again . Although kings and their ministers sought his council , the Buddha offered no grand political vision . He was powerless to stop the killing and the fighting . Even the men , women , and children of his former kingdom were massacred by a marauding king : forced into pits and trampled by elephants . It was said that the Buddha received the news in
zone3	, fail constantly , and part of our suffering is our - - is our failure , our recognition of our failure . Buddhismdoesn'targuewith reality . There will always be both the potential for awakening in any moment and the potential for incredible damage at any moment , and if we fool ourselves into thinking we 're past that , we will do incredible damage . GERE : Change , theBuddha said , must come from within . TheBuddhastartsalways with the mind and talks about the violence in the mind and says that violence in the world is a result of violence in the mind . Atreelivesonitsroots . if you change the root , you change the tree . Culture lives in human beings . if you change the human heart , the culture will follow . GERE : Fordecades , the Buddha shared his teachings all across northeastern India . " Let all beings be happy , " he taught , " weak or strong , great or small . Let us cherish all creatures , as a mother her only child . " Barefoot in his robes ,
zone3	, but old age was upon him . His back hurt . His stomach was often in pain . " I am old , worn out , " he told a trusted disciple , " like a dilapidated cart held together with thin straps . " The world is so sweet , he said , that he could understand wanting to live for at least another century . But he was frail and exhausted . He became ill near Kushinagar , a remote village near the border of Nepal , when he was offered a meal which would prove deadly . The food was spoiled . Heatewhatwas offeredto him , and it 's said that he knew it was bad , but he took it anyway ' cause it was offered and did n't want the person who offered it to feel bad , ' cause it was his time . [MAN_CHANTING] ? ? GERE : TodayKushinagaris revered by pilgrims as the place where the Buddha finally left the world . It was in Kushinagar where he grew weak and asked to be laid on his side in a quiet
zone3	, his disciples began to weep , stricken with grief . [EMOTIVE_INSTRUMENTAL_MUSIC] ? ? But the Buddha reassured them . " all things change , " he said . " Whatever is born is subject to decay . " He'ssayingthisis a natural process . He tells his disciples : " Use this time , use the energy here , even this , for your own awakening . " So he used even his own death and their sadness as a time to remind them of what their real task was . What he 's actually doing is inviting those who are close to him into the experience . I do n't think the Buddha 's teaching in any way argues against grief or sadness or loss . Theteachings , if theymake any sense , have to make sense in ordinary circumstances , in ordinary lives . And in ordinary lives , we grieve when we lose . We - - we grieve . We - - when it hurts , we say , " ouch . " Buddhism is trying to look at things the way they are , the
zone3	hurts . This is life . This is our life . And our relation to life involves losing it too . You do n't get beyond these things . You do n't get beyond them . It'sallrighttofeel what human beings feel , and we are not supposed to turn into rocks or trees when we practice Buddhism . Buddhas laugh , cry , dance , feel ecstasy , probably even feel despair . It is how we know the world . It is how we live inside of our hearts and not dissociated from them . GERE : TheBuddhahad always been saying good-bye . Now he prepared to leave the Earth forever . He would never be reborn , never die again . [BELL_GONGS] " It may be that after I am gone , " the Buddha told his disciples , " that some of you will think , ' now we have no teacher . ' But that is not how you should see it . Let the Dharma and the discipline that I have taught you be your teacher . All individual things pass away . Strive on
zone3	words . BROWN : TheBuddhadied peacefully . His head was pointed to the north , his face to the west . The stories tell how the Earth shook , and the trees suddenly burst into bloom ... their petals falling gently on his still body , falling out of reverence . Divine coralflowers and divine sandalwood powders fell from above on the Buddha 's body out of reverence . Hisdiscipleswerequite upset : " What are we going to do without our teacher ? We will be lost without our teacher . " But his instruction was so simple and so clear : " I am not your light . I am not your authority . You 've been with me a long time now . Be your own light . " TheBuddhasawdeathand life as inseparable . These are two sides of the same thing . Death is always with us . Death is part of the whole large unknown . And if we are unable to smile at the idea of the unknown , we 're in real trouble . That 's the realism that the Buddha was talking about
zone3	: Whenhe was29and still prince Siddhartha , the Buddha had left his wife , child , and family to try and understand the nature of suffering . [SOFT_INSTRUMENTAL_MUSIC] ? ? He had attained enlightenment , shared what he had learned , and left a path for others to follow . Now he was gone . But before he died , he had asked his followers to remember him by making pilgrimage ... to the place of his death ... to where he gave his first teachings ... where he achieved enlightenment ... and where he was born . Thosefourplacesmarkout a sacred biography . And in tracing that pilgrimage route , you are learning the story of that life . [MAN_CHANTING_FAINTLY] At places of pilgrimage , temples were built , images were installed , and relics were enshrined . GERE : AlthoughtheBuddhahad predicted that his teachings , like everything else , would in time disappear , Buddhism flourished in India for 1,500 years , spread into Sri Lanka , central and southeast Asia , Tibet , China , Korea , Japan , and in the 20th century , to Europe and
zone3	took root , attracting many millions of men and women who practice the Buddha 's teachings both within and outside the monastic community . But everywhere and in every age , the essence of the story remains the same . TheBuddhasaidthatwe 've turned this world into a painful place , and this world does not have to be a painful place . This world can be a world inhabited by Buddhas . But it 's up to each one of us to turn ourselves into a Buddha . That 's really - - that 's the work . IftheBuddhaisnotyou , finally , the Buddha is of no interest to you . The Buddha is - - the Buddha is of such interest to you because you are the Buddha . Iknowthatthereare supposed to be preserved footprints of the Buddha which are kept in one of the sacred places in India or Nepal , and , you know , you can stand in them , and if you stand in them , maybe you realize , " Ah , ten toes . Me too . " BROWN : Thereis astoryof a
zone3	, calmly meditating . The Buddha 's mind was still . he radiated such power and strength that the Brahman was reminded of a tusker elephant . The Brahman asked him who he was . " Imagine a lotus that had begun life underwater , " the Buddha replied ... " but grew and rose above the surface until it stood free . So I , too , have transcended the world and attained the supreme enlightenment . " " Who are you then ? " the Brahman wondered . " Remember me , " the Buddha said , " as the one who woke up .

My dick 's a basset hound . I 'm just the poor son of a bitch holding its chain
zone3	here neither . Well ... Nobody lives here 's asked me to leave . Yeah , well , most guys who make assholes of themselves do n't wait to be . Well , hell , John , that was nothin ' . I mean , you should 've come a few minutes earlier , got the same show the pizza man did . Should I put this in the fridge ? It feels like maybe it needs it . You mad at me for some reason , John ? I do n't like guns being pulled on me . If a fucking lunatic madman breaks into a place , what would you do ? Huh ? I do n't like ' em around my kid , neither . Oh , come on , now . A lifelong hunter like you , John ? I do n't believe that . See , the truth is , John , is I 'm like you . I am , you see , a person who makes good use of what he kills should n't have to worry what time a year it is
zone3	? Does Jess know you 're here ? Why do n't you ask her ? I might . You do that , John . You do that . And when you give Jess her little bag of goodies , you ask her if she knows old Obie , that 's short for " Obadiah , " Cornish . That 's like " The Hen . " Well , no shit , John . You know , we might actually be acquainted . Yeah ? How 's that ? Well , seeing 's how as , a number of years back , old Obie Cornish spent many a day busting his ass for peanuts , up and around that old mountain you 're on . Yup . Back in town now , after a lot of years , only to find that not much has changed , except I understand that you and yours had a string of bad luck .

[COCK_CROWS] And for sure there ai n't no money in dairying . I ai n't never had use for a full-time man before , but once Grady goes , it ai n't right that his mother should take up his slack . So ... [SIGHS] So if you could see your way clear to working for me on your old home , I 'm offering you a job , come fall . Good job . Long-term . You run this farm better than my daddy ever did . That 's the truth of it . Him losing it is no fault of yours , and I thank you for your offer , only I just , uh ...

Did n't Cornish get fired for stabbing a goat or something ? No , it was his heifer , he stabbed a heifer in the heart . He got shit-canned for it . Hey , now I know that one is like a big brother to you ... Simon ? Yeah , and he can work the tits off a mule when he 's sober , but he goes on one of his drinking jags , that 's a different man altogether . Yeah , but he can take all comers . Yeah . You wan na hose off before you go ? Nah . I 'll wash up at mine . Well , I hope the somebody you got in mind for that is gon na ... gon na get some good use out of it .

[SPEAKS_NATIVE_LANGUAGE] I would rather die here an old man , alone in prison , than to see my freedom bought at such a cost . WOMAN : A new turn today in the murder case of teenage activist Stompie Seipei as prosecutors announce that Mrs . Winnie Mandela would in fact be charged with kidnapping and assault . This follows amended testimony
zone3	that Mrs . Mandela had anything to do with the boy 's death . Mrs . Mandela , the court accepts that you might not have been fully aware of the assaults described , even though most of them took place at your home . However , the testimony that we have heard has also revealed you to be a calm , composed , deliberate and unblushing liar . Your complicity in maintaining the captivity of this boy , even after you became aware of the seriousness of the situation , has associated you with grievous crimes . [CAMERA_SHUTTERS_CLICKING] The African National Congress , the United Democratic Front and the Congress of South African Trade Unions have accepted a vote of no-confidence in Mrs . Winnie Madikizela Mandela . Unfortunately , she is simply not accountable to the structures and principles of the Mass Democratic Movement . Accordingly , Mrs . Mandela has been stripped of all membership in the alliance . We denounce her and distance ourselves from her actions and media statements . We got rid of her at last , or should I say she did it
zone3	, I 'm afraid . Too late , sir ? The only honorable and indeed realistic way forward , I believe , is to negotiate a peaceful transition of power to the ANC . A handover of power , sir ? We 've got this one chance to do the right thing and to avert a catastrophic civil war . We must support the notion of Nelson Mandela as the next president of South Africa . You are making a grave error . I pray to God that you are wrong , Brigadier . History will never forgive you . The Minister of Justice will oversee the release of political prisoners , the unbanning of political exiles . We will soon announce the release date of Mr . Nelson Mandela . Twenty-seven years . It has been a long time . But thanks to you , I was able to survive it . I owe you a debt of gratitude that I may never be able to repay . [FOOTSTEPS_APPROACHING] [KNOCK_ON_DOOR] Mr .

Having said that , this commission applauds you for coming forward . Mrs . Mandela , there is no doubt in my mind , nor should there be in anyone else ' s that you have had a hard ,
zone3	you have made enormous sacrifices .

I 'm pretty sure I 'm not . - Did you know I 'm on the basketball team ? - Really ? Yeah , point guard . - That 's cool . You must be ... pretty good . - Yeah . Actually I 'm probably the best one on the team . I got ta run . Practice . Bye , dad . Not having a structured daily schedule , it really takes some getting used to . You 'll figure it out . Really appreciate you getting me this job . I wish I could do more , Ken . I really do . What a practice . I mean
zone3	. I was totally on fire from three-point land . I was like ... Pop ! Pop ! Pop ! Honestly , I felt kinda bad for the other girls . - Did you want some ice cream ? - No , I 'm cool . I just ... thought I 'd swing by and keep you company , you know , and get to know each other a little . Hey , Boyd , It 's not cocktail hour , Boyd . Oh , of course not , sir . Table four has got some new gum on its underside . Go introduce yourself . - Hey , mister . - Yes ? - You 're rich , right ? - Well , I ... - do quite well . - I 'm sure . - What kind of car do you drive ? - It 's a champagne Camry . Wow !

That ... is ... weird . What the hell 's happening in my town , sheriff ? Doing everything we can , sir . - Well , it 's clearly not enough . - Sir , with all due respect , you do n't want to bring in outside help . That 's fine . But that just leaves me and Ernie here to solve the problem . And hell ! Those other two guys can barely read . Now , you ca n't
zone3	to sprint . So , please either call in reinforcements , take my badge , or shut the fuck up . It 's quite a tableau , huh , Ernie ? Tableau , sir ? Allow yourself to look at this thing in the greater context , as part of the whole . The killer 's use of ... abstract expressionism . In the obvious homage to the great works of Marcel Duchamp . It 's like the bodies before it , is displayed with a sense of minimalistic purity constraint . Like the dumpster , the wicker chair . Now , you see the bathtub , it 's ... Imprisonment . I bring justice . Punishment . Punishment for what , you think ? I have no idea . Why do you smell like eucalyptus ? - How 's the spaghetti , hun ? - Great , thanks . Good . - Do you cook , dad ? - I made lasagna once . - Yeah ? - It was pretty good . Really ? Do n't make me lie twice , Ken . So how do you like

Oh , c'm on , she 's a big girl . What are you , 19 ? - 11 . - That 's close enough . - Do you have any idea who 's doing it ? - Well let 's put it this way , hun , if we dumped all of our leads into a bucket , and then dunked your head in , you would n't drown . But do n't tell the mayor that . - Dad ? - Oh , hey . Whatcha doing ? - Errands . - Errands ? - Well , it 's just ... - In Clifton ? Clifton . You came to give me a ride home , did n't you ? I 'll take that as a yes . What 's with all this ? Oh , these are ... When it rains , the floor wells get damp , so

Let 's go . - What 's this ? - It 's an ice cream sundae . - Boring . - You do n't want it ? Well , the whole plan is to mix as many flavors as possible . Cranberries , yogurt chips , coconut thingies , caramel . You got ta spice it up . - Hey , do you have any gummy worms back here ? - That 's disgusting . - You should be ashamed of yourself . - I am . Check out what I got at the gas station . - I know some people who could use one of these . - Yeah , me too . I would 've gotten more , but that was the last one . Do n't look now . But there is a woman over there , who 's totally checking you out . Way not to look . Go help her . Nah , Betsy

I will trade you my number for another scoop of that surprisingly good banana-zz thing . Sure . Throw in 2 dollars and 90 cents , and you got yourself a deal . No , seriously . If the till is low , my boss will tear me apart . - You like this stuff , huh ? - Sure
zone3	then . Bye . - Bye . So , where ya gon na take her ? What ? Nowhere . I 'm not gon na call her . Yeah , great idea . Women would love that . I 'm in no shape to be going on a date . Well then , you 'll just have to get in shape . I 've got homework . You think about where you gon na take her , and then we 'll discuss . By the way ... Betsy knows a lot about sex . Sit down . What ? Am I interrupting something ? We 're going to have a date . - A date ? - You need to practice . Okay , I do n't know a whole lot about you . But I know you 're not much of a talker . That 's okay in this situation . Let her talk . Women love to talk . You listen . - Listen . - Mm-hm . I could do that . You should probably ask a question . Ask a question ? So I should talk
zone3	Okay . - No ? Nothing ? - Give me a minute . Okay , I 'll go . - How 'd you get this ? - I do n't wan na talk about that . - Polar bear attack , right ? - No . - Sword fight ? - No . - Steel cage match ? - Not quite . Well , whatever . Your scar 's cooler than Harry Potter 's . The lightning bolt . Gay . I guess my ultimate goal in basketball is to get a nickname . - A nickname , huh ? - Uh-huh . The Iceman , the Admiral , the Mailman . If you get a nickname , it 's like people care enough to come up with something . Plus , Amy 's kind of ... blah . I see myself more as a ... Georgina . I like Amy . I had fun today . - You did ? - Mm-hm . We should do it again sometime . Wan na tuck me in ? C'm on , it 's easy . Pollers report show that only 5
zone3	year . Who 's the 11 year old girl here ? Good ... sleep ... you . - You want this open or closed ? - Open . - This much ? - Yeah , that 's good . Thanks . Do n't you fuck this up . We 're gon na get freaky on her Murphy bed . I will have the vegetable plate , thank you . I 'll have the curry goat , and a side order of ribs . What was it ? Oh , yes . I 've been here about 8 months , maybe . I just ... I needed a change of scenery from Cincinnati , so ... - Cincinnati ? - Well , London , before that . I followed a guy back to the States , like a little puppy . And then the two of us married . Despite knowing absolutely nothing about one another , which I do n't recommend . So ... How is Green Oaks treating you ? Yeah , it 's ... So far so good . I am working at a travel agency , which
zone3	like charcoal . But , you know I 'm just using it to get some cheap trips , and I 'm hoping to fly back to England , and visit my parents . Eat some humble pie . Do you like to travel ? - I do n't know . - You do n't know . I 've never really traveled . Ever ? Anywhere ? How is that possible ? - Well , I 've been away . - Away ? What ? Like prison ? Sorta . Cotton Valley State Hospital . Is that the ... this ... like ... A place for crazy people , yeah . I 'll close my eyes , and give you a chance to leave . I wo n't be offended . My ex was a Harvard-educated pediatrician . He turned out to be an alcoholic cocksucker who videotaped me while sleeping , and cheated on me throughout our sham of a marriage . I try not to clench up . It always blows my mind that people can draw with such detail . If I drew a stick figure , with
zone3	, you 'd still be like , what did she draw ? This is kind of amazing . Yup , it 's nice . What do we have here then ? A frustrated artist , or a harsh critic ? No , I leave the art to the artist . Oh ! No ... I ca n't believe they made me buy it . Weird . - I had a very good time . Thank you . - Me too . - I had fun . - Good . - Good night then . - I bought this painting for you . Oh , lovely . Thank you . I do n't know where I 'm going to ... Can you get the door ? Okay , take care . - Bye now . - Bye . - Whatcha doing out here , Kenny ? - Hey , sheriff . Just a little private time to draw . Wrap my mind around things . Yeah , I hear ya . There 's a lot going on these days , huh ? So , drawing helps you , right ? You
zone3	do n't actually play the game but just thinking about it for some reason relaxes the shit out of me Let me have a look see at that . C'm on , Kenny , I hear you got real talent . - Who said that ? - Well , your good buddy , Irv . I heard him pushing you to do the owl fest . That guy , you know , trying to get you to do the brochures , or the flyers and stuff . - He did ? - Oh , yeah , yeah . Irv , yeah . He was pushin ol ' Glen really hard , but apparently Glen 's already got a guy . I 'd never seen Irv so worked up , especially over something that does n't really concern him . You want a piece of gum ? - Yeah . - Here you go . So ... C'm on , let me have a look at that . Wait . Look at that . - That 's a thing of beauty , Kenny . - Really ? I tell ya that
zone3	you , kid . Well ... I 'll leave you to it . You have a good one . I 'm not seeing it , Ernie . All I 'm seeing are tire tracks and mud . Now , you say I 'm supposed to be seeing a hidden image of Jesus here ? No . No , sir . Just the tracks . These are the tracks that we picked up at the drive-in movie . They are made by Yokohama Avid T4s . But it 's a really common tire . - How common ? - Gary from the Tire Center ... said that he sold that model to hundreds of customers just in this year alone . You should go get a list from Gary , and then ... cross-reference it with Green Oaks High grads . - Green Oaks High ? - All the victims were from Green Oaks High , and right now that 's the only connection they have . There you go , Mildred , an extra scoop of praline on me . Oh , thank you . You have a nice day
zone3	do me a huge favor ? - Yeah , what 's up ? I want to catch the end of Amy 's practice . Will you cover for me ? - Yeah , man . Of course . - Thanks a lot . Give me one more and I will pass out . Wonderful , wonderful . Keep it moving . Let 's hustle . Nice , nice . Okay , that 's a good sound . I heard the swish of the best . Nicely done . Well done . All right , come up . Okay , all right . You know what ? I 'm gon na step out . You guys keep playing around . Do you wan na be Wheeler ? Do you wan na be Wheeler ? No , you do n't wan na be Wheeler . Keep playing . Keep playing like you know how to play basketball . No , I 'm just trying to figure out . Why you 're even on the team , Wheeler , when you know you 're not gon na get any playing time ? Yeah
zone3	. All right ? And wearing a purity ring does n't make you a virgin . What did you just say ? Yeah . Go get it . Hey ! Next time , why do n't you pick on someone your own si ... Wow . Nice , buddy . Sorry , I do n't mean to be laughing about your accident . I ... You know ... It 's fine . I just ... The next time I see that other car , It 's gon na be a little awkward . I refuse to drive . It 's something about the steering wheel that I ca n't get out of my mind . Like a little tug here or there , and you 've killed someone , which is just ... is too much power for me . I guess I 'll take power wherever I can get it . You 're a dad . You have all the power in the world . That 's like the world 's worst greeting card ever . Hey , Toots ! Why do n't you stop by the surplus store
zone3	's a little wanker , is n't he ? - You know what we should do ? - What ? I think we should buy Amy something . - Buy her something ? Like what ? - I do n't know . Use your imagination . Up for some action ? You know what ? I 'm pretty exhausted . Practice was crazy . - I know . - You know what ? I know you suck . I mean , I stopped by at practice to pick you up . I saw . Coach needed 8 for a team , and only 8 showed up for tryouts . It does n't matter . Let 's see your form . C'm on , let 's go . I could teach you that shot if you want . All right , balance . Legs shoulder-width apart . And your knees . Okay , you hold the ball with this hand . - And shoot with this hand , okay ? - Okay . That 's good . Watch me . Were you on your high school team ? - Not exactly
zone3	secretive , huh ? - I did n't make the team . - Hey , an answer ! See , now it was n't so hard ? Shoot . I think that was actually closer . It 's like some horrible parlor game I do n't understand . Well , 6 more and we could field a baseball team . Not the time , sorry . Where 're those yearbooks ? - You going out ? - Yeah , in a few minutes . - Where are you going ? - Just have to take care of a few things . So , we have a pretty big game on Thursday and I 'd like you to come . Will you come ? Sure , I 'll come . - And bring Stephanie . - Yeah ? You like her , do n't you ? - Nah . - You player . Okay , I 'll call her . Sweet . I 'll be the one on the bench . All right . - Good night . - Night . They 're all on the same fucking team ! -
zone3	at that ! The Bee , the Black Cat , - the Map of the U.S . ! - He 's picking off the whole team . There 's only one of them who still lives here . Miller 's . No , we 're closed . We 're open at nine . Nine . Shit . Fucker ! Who the fuck 's out there ? I just cleaned this fucker . You do not wan na do this . I was in the Green Berets , asshole . And the Navy SEALs . And , I was a Gettysburg ... Fuck ! Fuck me ! I think I still have bullets . Shit . He did n't dump it . Why ? No , he still has skid marks outside . He left in a damn hurry . Somebody interrupted him . He got spooked . Think he 's all gone ? Sir ? Found another body last night . - Yeah ? - Mm-hm . What happened to your hand ? I was opening a box of sprinkles , and the box cutter got away from me .
zone3	should be more careful . - Yeah . - Mm-hm . And when your hand scars , your wrist will have a new friend . The tire tracks , outside of Miller 's store , match the tire tracks in the mud of the drive-in theater . And , according to Gary , from the Tire Center , Ken purchased a set a few months back . Yeah , same kinda tire , but not enough to get us to Boyd . But he did go to Green Oaks High . Yeah , but what 's his connection to the basketball team ? Well , ca n't we at least bring him in for questioning ? No , no , no , not yet . Boyd may be fucking weird , but I ca n't arrest him for - fucking weird . Besides , if I bring Ruth 's son in , I 'm wrong , she 's likely to stop giving it up , and I 've sorta taken a shine to her . Oh , hey ! What 's up ? Hey , going to work . We
zone3	No , thanks . Too many fractions to multiply . Okay , be back soon . Amy ? Hey . What 'd you do ? - What ? - She left . I went out , came back . She was gone . I thought I told you not to fuck this up . Amy . Did n't work out . - Well , I hate to say , " I told you so . " - Then , do n't . Now , you know why I kept you away . He 's a loser , Amy . Asshole ! It 's been going on for 3 days . C'm on , get inside . You 're damn near on time . I know what it is . I 'm not your speed limit . - You working tonight ? - I asked for Betsy 's shift . - I thought you had Amy 's game . - No , I 'm not going . Why ? - She left . - She left ? Yeah . - Why ? - I do n't know . - Did n't
zone3	Ken , why not ? Cuz I did n't . I mean who the fuck was I kidding , I 'm not a father . We had it right when she thought I did n't exist . I told you . She should n't be around me . Whatever , man . - No extra scoop ? - Not today . Hi , it 's me ... Stephanie . I 'm just ... I 'm calling to see if you 're okay , cuz I think we ... had plans to go to Amy 's game tonight . You know , so ... Give us a call . You 're a Jackal . Be strong . Come on . Walk it off . Wheeler , you 're in . Ha ha , very funny , coach . Well , we 're up 28 points . With 6 seconds left , I 'm actually curious to see if you can eff this up . Awesome . What are you doing here ? What ? It 's nice to see you too . What do you want ? Wow . Um ...
zone3	why you stood me up . I had to work . You could n't have called or ... It 's not gon na work out , all right ? I do n't understand , cuz ... we were having a really nice time together . 4 homicides have been commited in the small community of Green Oaks . Kenneth Boyd , 34 , a local resident , was taken into custody late last night , for his involvement in the grisly slayings of 4 other Green Oaks residents . All were killed in what police are calling premeditated executions , utilizing a hatchet , machete , and butcher knife . Boyd was recently released from Cotton Valley State Hospital , after a stint for clinical depression and suicidal tendencies . The victims have been identified as Marty Prichard , Wade Hutchinson , Lyle Bagwell , and Brett Miller . All local businessmen . For more on this story as it develops ... Hey ! You know , I got to admit , Kenny . I was ... I was hoping it was n't you . Turn that thing on ,
zone3	on the player . I 'm sorry I went into your room , but ... I tell ya , these ... these drawings . Excuse me , these drawings , they are just beautiful . All of them . Look at that . I mean , in a fucked up kinda way . Also , you left this ... in a couple of the crime scenes . That 's the thing about tires . They leave tracks . So , you know , it took us a while , to figure out what your connection to all this was , Kenny . I mean , who would hate the basketball team that much that he 'd kill ' em a whole buncha years later . You know , I was at the mayor 's office today and ... Want some gum ? We were discussing the upcoming festival , you know . It hit me . Who would have motive ? Who ? Who ? Who-oo ? Exactly . The Owl . Whooooo . Look , Irv . I 'm sorry about your friend . You stood up for him
zone3	can you really be ? I mean , you spend your whole life fuckin ' up , you 're bound to snap , right ? Come on . Give me some of that " Fooger " energy . Amy . - Hey . - Hey , Irv . I was wondering if I could talk to you , but , about my dad . Like , right now ? You knew him pretty well . I thought maybe you can clear some stuff up for me . - Yeah . Yeah , sure . Come on in . - Thanks . Did you visit my dad a lot when he was away ? No . No , I didn't . - Just ... Sit there . - How come ? Well , you know , I really wanted to , but it was hard . I did nt really ... I did n't like seeing him like that . Why did he hate those basketball players so much ? I mean , he wanted to be on the team . And when he did n't make the cut , he
zone3	mascot . And ... for a while , he thought he was one of the guys . But , of course , the assholes on the team , they did n't see it that way . And , it built ... and it built to the point where ... where they thought they could do anything to him . And then this comic book came out . And it made them look like idiots . I mean , these players . They were used to being treated like kings . And now ... the whole school was making fun of them . So , one night , they decided to make him pay for it . What did they do ? Do you want some water ? Let me get you some water , okay ? - He did n't confess ? - No . No . But he also did n't deny it either . He just , kind of , sat there . I never thought he 'd hurt someone . You know , it 's hard to imagine what those guys did to him . But ,
zone3	know it 's a little awkward now seeing as I just arrested your son for murdering a bunch of people but I hope , in time , - we could get pass this ? - Not likely . - You mind if I grab a cold one for the road ? - No . I 'm gon na drink and drive , so do n't tell the cops . Amy made that for me . Fucking adorable , ai n't it ? I wish I were creative . Must be one hell of a release . - Here you go . - Thanks . What was that ? - Oh , that 's my cat . He hates being locked up . - I did n't know you had a cat . What kind ? I do n't know . Like a ... you know , just like a cat - - cat , regular cat . - You mean , other ... You mean , other kinds ? - Yes , sure , there 's like 40 different breeds . See ? I did n't know that . Now
zone3	, who does n't like getting mail ? You literally ramped up the creepy on them . My favorite . Want to know my favorite ? " I am a monster . " Gave me the chills . - You did a really nice job on that . - Thanks . - What are you doing here , Kenny ? - Excuse me ? We never got that message - " I am a monster . " That was ... " Son of Sam " or something like that . - That 's good water . Thanks . - Yeah . - So , is there , like , anything else you needed ? - Your cat does n't sound so good . Can I say , " Hi " ? No , you see , he 's just skittish you know that 's why I put him in the room when I heard the doorbell . - I 'm really good with cats , though . - I would rather you not . - Why ? - I 'm just a little overprotective , okay ? - I 'll
zone3	today , Amy . Okay ? - Your cat sounds sick . - Look , the cat , okay ? She 's fine . - I thought it was a " he " . - Goddammit kid ! I do nt need any of this right now ! Look , Amy . I just think it would be best if you went home , okay ? - Okay , I 'll go . I 'm sorry . - Yeah , that 's for the best . Bye , Amy . I 've been looking at this evidence all wrong . These drawings . They do n't indict you . They exonerate you . I mean , you get it out on the work . Kill ' em on the page , so you do n't need to kill ' em for real . I mean , you clearly hated the fucking guys , and you wanted ' em dead , but ... Maybe you even ... I do n't know , visited some of the crime scenes ? Maybe you even tried to convince yourself that you could actually do
zone3	. You 're not a killer . The only person you could really hurt is yourself . Ooh boy , that leaves us in a very ... a very interesting place here . You kill a bunch of guys on paper , and then these bunch of guys ends up dead . Now , it may not have been you . But , it sure as shit got to be somebody who hated them as much as you . Who ... you know . This thirst for ... punishment . Justice , sick . Sick ... just ... So , what 's your pal , Irv , been up to lately ? Quiet . Please keep quiet . Your father gave him everything he had . And then he wanted to destroy him . They tore away his soul . They took away his life . And I could have stopped it . - You 're hurting me ! - Something has to be done , okay ? - I could n't let him get away with it . - Please let me go ! - I ca n't .
zone3	It 's over , okay ? Calm down . Calm down . I never killed anyone before . When I killed Prichard , it felt good . And when I killed Wade Hutchinson , it felt fucking great . My hatred began to build . With each asshole that I killed ... Made things better . Ken did n't have it in him . He could never do what needed to be done . You got your 5 guys , Irv . Why Fooger ? I failed to protect him once . I was n't gon na fail him again . The bad guys need to be punished . Ah , you 're quite a friend , Irv . You would have made a lousy cop . I wanted to kill them , sheriff . I wanted to kill them more than anything . Yeah , I know , but you did n't . If thinking about killing a bunch of pricks made us guilty , we 'd all be locked up for life . You know , wait a minute . I got ta ask you , Kenny .
zone3	I 'm not really sure where I fit in this world , sheriff . Being locked away just seems a lot easier . If you do n't know your purpose out here , Kenny , you 're dumber than a bag of shit . - Hi , may I help you ? - Yeah , I 'm here for my daughter . - Oh , sorry . You are ... - Her father . Amy ! - Ken , what are you doing here ? - Dad ? - Hey there . You want to come over ? - Hell , yeah . Get your stuff . - Ken you ca n't come in here and take her like that - 11 years , Janet . It 's my turn now . So how 's it going ? You 're good ? - This is for you . - What 's this ? - It 's a little something . - Is it a puppy ? That is the best nickname ever . Thanks , dad . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry about the other day . I
zone3	and innocent . - I 'm excited for the weekend . Who 's excited ? - What do you have planned ? - Well , there 's the owl festival . - Oh , what else do you have planned ? We can shoot some hoops . How 's your shot ? - Still sucks . But I hit backboard now . - That 's good . That 's something . Ma , Amy 's here . No shit , Ken . *** Subtitles manually transcribed by Subtopian ***

Can you get us his autograph ? BOBBY : How often do you see him ? These days we only see each other at Thanksgiving , but unfortunately ... last year he had to cancel . What about you ? Where are your parents ? Um ... Visiting our grandparents in Florida .
zone3	Mr . Levinson ? I think the safest place for all of us to be right now is by my David . Since you 're the leading expert on his condition , I really wanted you to see this . How can his connection be so strong ? During the first attack ... he was exposed to their collective mind . It was completely unfiltered . I need to ask him about this . I already have . He does n't even remember drawing them . Okay , let 's try this baby on for size . You know , I helped bring that thing back from space . Is there anything I can do ? Yeah . Back off . Yeah . Of course . ( SAWWHIRRING ) ( EXHALES ) Command , we have visual . ADAMS : Roger , Captain Hiller . Continue approach . Mission is a go . Bay-18 , sir . Why 'd you put it all the way up there ?

Hell , I 'll thank you right now . ( MANGRUNTING ) MAN : We just lost bomber 9 ... and bomber 13 , sir . Command , we ca n't get to the top of the ship . It 's too heavily armed . We 're dropping like flies out here . Come on ! I think we need to fly inside . No , that 's suicide . Sir ? Morrison 's right . This is our only shot . Do it ! We 'll detonate the bombs from the Command Center ... and we 'll give you enough time to get the hell out of there . DYLAN : Copy that . Jake , follow my lead . JAKE : I 'm on your wing . DYLAN : All bombers , we 're going in . They did n't follow us . MAN

I had 20 years to get us ready . And we never had a chance . We did n't last time either . We always knew they were coming back . But look how far we 've come . In the last 20 years ... this planet has been unified in a way that 's unprecedented in human history . That 's sacred . That 's worth fighting for . We convinced an entire generation that this is a battle that we could win ... and they believed us . We ca n't let them down . And it was n't luck last time . It was our resolve . We all have to fight ... till our last breath . And that is gon na lead us to victory . You understand some of their language . I 'd like you to tell me
zone3	So , okay , how about this one ? This talks about an intergalactic war . This concerns the whole universe . What about this one ? DIKEMBE : Something about an enemy . It needs to be destroyed before it gets to us . Wait . I had a case study in Brazil ... where my patient did n't describe the circle ... as " fear . " He referred to it ... as " enemy . " Of course .

zone3	to be different from theirs . It speaks ! ( LAUGHS ) In English ! SPHERE : I deconstructed your primitive language . We 're primitive ? Correct . My species shed our biological existence ... for a virtual one thousands of years ago . Far out . Why are you here ? When I intercepted their distress call ... I knew they would come to exterminate you . I came to evacuate as many of you as possible . But you attacked me with the same weapons they used on us . They attacked you ? Correct . A Harvester Ship conquered our planet ... and extracted its molten core . They use them to refuel their ships ... and grow their technology . They have done this to countless civilizations . We fought them for thousands of years ... but they destroyed all of our ships . I am the sole survivor . BRAKISH : I am so sorry to hear that . Do you have a plan ? My system holds the key to superior technology . And there is a hidden planet ... where I teach
zone3	that will defeat them ... once and for all . CATHERINE : That 's why they 're afraid of you . You 're the only one's who threaten their existence . Correct . But now that I am activated ... the queen will detect my signature ... and hunt me down . It 's too late . She 's already on her way . Yeah . She 's coming . Hey , what would happen ... if we were able to kill her ? No one has ever killed a Harvester queen . That 's encouraging . But as a hive ... her fighters will fall , and her ship will leave your planet . Recalled by other Harvester queens . But it 's too late now . You must terminate me ... or she will get the coordinates to the refugee planet . And that will be the end . Wait , wait a second . If we 're so sure that she 's coming here to get you ... maybe we can bait her ... like she baited us . Mr . President , Dr . Okun thinks
zone3	signal ... David , English , please . Every computer has a radioactive signature ... whether it 's your laptop , your phone , even your watch . But the Sphere has an RFR that 's completely off the charts . So , if we hide the real Sphere ... inside the isolation chamber ... and pack this decoy transmitter , so to speak ... onto a tug filled with cold fusion bombs ... and lure her out to the salt flats ... We can fly it right up her royal ass and bon voyage ! You set off cold fusion bombs ... you 're gon na kill everyone from here to Houston . Not if we use the shield generators from this base to contain the blast . Without our shields , you better put a blaster in every able bodied hand ... and get them ready to shoot some aliens . RITTER : Yes , sir . Now , we just need a way to see her coming . Follow me . Do your thing . My thing ? Do my thing ? My thing ! MAN :

The higher , the better . Yes , sir . Look what I found in the hold . We should be able to communicate with this . Let 's hook up the antenna . (

We only have ... one . Call it in . Area 51 , do you copy ? ( SIGHS ) DAVID : So , the idea ... is to get her to follow this tug ... into the salt flats ... using the decoy transmitter on board . And once she 's taken the bait ... our cold fusion bombs can go to town . It 's
zone3	: There 's a catch . As you know , they took out all of our satellites ... which means that somebody ... is gon na have to fly it in manually . And I know that I 'm asking for the ultimate sacrifice . I know that . But you ... you are the only pilots we have left . And I need a volunteer . Let 's get it done . I 'll fly it in . WHITMORE : No , you wo n't . I 'll do it . ADAMS : Mr . President . ( EXHALES ) Dad , what are you doing ? WHITMORE : Patty . There are a lot of reasons why I 'm the best choice for this . You all have to pick up the pieces once it 's over . This is my part . Matthew ... do not let him get on that tug . Do you understand me ? MAN : Get the hell off the road ! If we go any slower , we 'll be going backwards . Do n't be a shmuck . We have

He went to go have sex with his girlfriend . Yes ! All aboard ! Wait ! What about our car ? We 'll get a new one when you get your license . On the bus , everybody ! ( SWITCHCLICKS ) Tell the General we 're up and running . ADAMS : Bring it in . Spin it around . All right , plug it in . RITTER : Radar is operational , sir . ADAMS : Son of a bitch . All right , they 're coming in fast . David ... we got a real fire storm coming our way and not a lot of time to prepare . Give me numbers , Mr . President . Nine minutes to the queen 's ship 's arrival ... roughly 22 minutes before the drill reaches our molten core . Jesus Christ . Take your positions

My son , Andre , you and I have the same blood in our veins . Here is to many good adventures . May we all live long . Detective Cassidy . Special Agent Reed , Human Trafficking Task Force . What can I do for the FBI ? Well , you know I 'd hoped for a little more inter-agency
zone3	. - Stop so ... - Leaks , yeah I understand . Look , you know , it 's not too late to hand the op over to us , you know . Viktor Dragovic . Ex-Serbian national , now working in Russia . Thank you for coming in late . Dragovic made a fortune in hotels and gambling in Eastern Europe and Asia . But he 's also a major player in what I consider the most despicable endeavor on Planet E , human trafficking . Dragovic kidnaps young girls in South East Asia , runs them through Europe then sells them all over the globe . The skin trade 's worth billions of dollars . Last year alone this country saw over 2000 cases and I consider every single one of those a goddamned tragedy . This is Dragovic 's oldest son , Goran . Educated in England . Son number two , Ivan . Runs the Middle East operation . This is son number three , Andre . Is n't he cute ? - He 's a student at NYU . - And there 's a fourth
zone3	Asia . Okay , you all know Nick Cassidy . He 's the case officer in this particular opus . Take it away Nick . This morning we fished Dex Guroff , an informant , out of the Hudson . Two gunshot wounds to the head . Before he was killed Dex confirmed to me that Viktor Dragovic is here in Jersey . Now thanks to shared bi-lateral intelligence by the Royal Thai Police , we know why . Better . We know where . Our target is the ship The Cambodian Star . The coast guard confirms it arrives at Pier 21 at the Jersey Docks in less than three hours . Ladies and gentlemen , we 're going to make sure that coming to America was the worst decision Viktor Dragovic ever made . Andre , relax . This time , your first time , I will be with you . Open door . Go , go , go , go . Move ! It 's not my fault . Janko , your son . But you ? You are the boat skipper . Where I come from
zone3	Andre , you will prove that you are your father 's son . But the blood in my veins is the same as the blood of yours . Make me proud . Please . Please , no . Please ! This is the police . If you have any weapons lie them down . Andre ! Left side cover ! Andre ! Stay with him ! You have to run , Andre . He can not chase us both . - I want to fight with you . - Obey me , Andre ! Run . Survive . I 'll prove to you ... I am my father 's son ! No ! I 've waited my whole life for this moment . I am not afraid to die . Do it . Do it ! - You okay ? - Yeah . Holy Christ . Mr . Dragovic was unaware of the contents of the container . He maintains he never fired a shot . And that he and his son Andre were caught in your mishandled operation . My client is a respected businessman in Russia and in
zone3	, Colonel ? Pretty dicey for you to go back there . All those bodies in that container , did they give you a little buzz on your old genocide days ? Mr . Dragovic was exonerated by the International Crimes Tribunal in the Hague . He is a Russian citizen now . The Russian government have been contacted and you ... - Excuse me , Captain . - Yeah ? Be right back . Who 's this , Reed ? Russian counsel . Mr Romanov , this is Captain Costello . I spoke to the Russian embassy in Washington . I 'm here to monitor my client 's human rights . Really ? His human rights ? Are you fucking kidding me ? You 're lucky I do n't poke your fucking eyes out . Let me know when he 's gone , Reed . I 'm going to wrap every dead body from that container around your neck . 30 counts of murder . You should have killed me in that dockyard , Detective . How the hell can you sleep at night ? How can you do
zone3	Ask my customers . When they stop buying , I stop selling . Goran . Ivan . The skipper you recommended ? He fucked up . The police know about the delivery . Janko . Our baby brother is dead . Father in prison ! All our contacts in the government over there will have to come over soon . Russia wo n't take us anymore . And do n't you fuck this one up . - I ... - You 're family , okay ? You 're blood . Even if it is diluted whore 's blood . And Andre 's killer ? Do n't you fucking worry about that . Come on in . Janko here , he has picked you to be in one of his movies . Now can you say , ' fuck my ass ' in that lovely Vietnamese accent of yours ? Wow . Get up ! Tony , the Americans , they have Viktor . We know . The sons , they try to get him out . They have contact in government . They want revenge too against the cop that
zone3	stop this work . It 's dangerous . When I call the police and give information they said they would protect me . We have . Every time . So as long as you are on the case , I do what I do . Maybe it stop what happened to me happening to other girls . - Let 's see what you got . - Okay . By your art , my dearest father , you have put the wild waters in this roar , allay them . The sky , it seems , would pour down stinking pitch , But that the sea , mounting to the welkin 's cheek , dashes the fire out . Oh , I have suffered with those that I saw suffer . You do exactly that on Friday . You 'll be there ? Have n't I been there at all the important moments of your life ? No . You have n't . What ? Are you two ganging up on me ? Alright , you get some sleep . I 'm going to have to deal with this ... this
zone3	in that crate were Sofia 's age . At least she has you looking out for her . You know , today I stared into a man 's eyes and knew nothing was looking back . How does that happen ?

Happy anniversary . What now ? Are you even ... that I said no phone calls . It 's Costello . I got ta take it . Yeah ? Hey Nick , it 's Costello . Listen up , this is important . I just got off the phone with the Thai police in Bangkok . - Listen , Viktor Dragovic is ... - Rosa ! Nick . This is for our brother . No ! Dad ? Sofia , get back . Dad ! Please do n't . Dad ! Jesus , Nick . Nick , can you hear me ? It 's Costello
zone3	're probably the last two guys in the world you want to talk to right now . It 's the wrong time and place . Let 's get out of here . Nick ? Nick ? Rosa . Sofia . I 'm sorry . Nick . Rosa and Sofia are dead . Their bodies were consumed by the blaze . The firefighters found you downstairs . - Dragovic ? - He 's gone . Diplomatic pressure convinced the judge to grant him bail . As soon as he was on the street he was in the air . There was nothing we could do . Russians would n't take him . We think he 's somewhere in Thailand , maybe Cambodia . Nick , you do n't need to think about this right now , man . All the guys sent you this card and I 'm going to put it right here . There was a funeral . How much did Dragovic pay you counsel ? I 'm a diplomat . I have immunity ! - I have a wife ! Children ! - So did I . Where
zone3	Baby Doll . Viktor . You have to move on . There 's nothing more I can do . What do you mean ? Nothing more you can do . The Americans are insisting , and the Thai too . They are applying heavy political pressure . I ca n't keep denying that you are here forever . There 's only so much I can do without them asking questions . There can be political consequences . The woman in the photo , she is not your wife . And the girl in the next one , she is about the same age as your daughter . Okay . I 'll try for two more weeks . But then you must leave for Laos . That works . Hey , hey , hey , hey ! No running I said ! I want to put in place a plan for you , my sons . To take over the companies . You , Goran , will oversee all the operations in Russia , Ukraine , Belarus . Ivan , you will take over Romania , Bulgaria , Hungary , Czech
zone3	South East Asia . Janko ? Not bad . I 'm getting good ! I like a girl who can fight . 21 cuts , 7 cigarette burns . How old were you when they took you from Vietnam to Germany ? Twelve . You know , I remember my mother ... was really upset ... because she only got $700 and not $1000 . Agent Reed is from the FBI 's human trafficking task force . This is special branch major Tony Vitayakul , his partner , Captain Nung . This is cell phone footage shot by a guest at a New York restaurant owned by Viktor Dragovic 's attorney . ... Cambodia , Baby Doll . Watch the background . He took a plane to Dallas . From there we tracked him to Mexico City where he could buy a fake American passport for under $1000 . But he bought it from a snitch and you know how these things pan out . We think Nick is suffering from a severe psychological breakdown . Nick 's plane landed exactly 18 minutes ago . I got lucky . Cassidy
zone3	's on the south ramp . He went that way . You stay with Nung . Get out of the way ! Get out of the way ! - Yes ? - Tony . He at Baby Doll now . - We 'll be there . - Okay , quick .

Where 's Janko ? - Where 's ... - He 's at the warehouse . By the river . Where he keeps his stock . Hey . Let 's go . Go , go , go ! Stay here . Where 's Janko ? You 're not my brother . You 're the son of a whore who fucked everything up . Father would never ! Father says goodnight . Janko ! Where 's Viktor ? Hey , Janko ! Get it over with . The man you killed had a wife and kid ! Another one coming in a month ! I told you I did n't kill him . Reed shot him with his own weapon and gave it to me . Down
zone3	! Can you hear me ? Where 's your father going ? Where ? Cheng ... Cheng Chao . Cheng Chao . When did Dragovic get you ? Guess we all have our price , Nick . Look at the price you paid . You should have got with the program . You two think you 're gon na stop the skin trade just because you run around like fucking boy scouts ? Fuck you care about these girls ? They 'll just rot wherever they are anyway . And you will rot in hell . He mentioned an air strip . Cheng Chao . You know it ? Cheng Chao . The Cambodia border . Hold still . Why are you doing this ? You 're hurt . No , this . Going to the border . Probably getting ourselves killed . - It 's my job . - Bullshit . You 're talking to a cop here . There 's Min , my informant . She 's my girlfriend .

The kids ! Listen , okay . You see those trees ? I want you to run and hide behind them . I want you to look back . Remember the faces of these men . If something happens your father or me , it is your duty to do something about it when you get older . Remember . Now run ! Dad . It is a helicopter . You can watch me kill her . - Go . - No , no , no . We are not finished . Go ! Too bad you 'll never see your daughter again . Sofia ,

[Gunshot] Look , I know he needs a gig , but it 's just , I 'm just wondering if y'all kind of need to open yourselves up to some other possibilities , you know ? He 's embarrassed . I know .
zone3	I really do . And he 's just not that keen on asking for a job . Lord knows it 's nowhere in the neighborhood of being a rock star , but , I mean , I 've got ... I 've got something he can help me out with . Really ? Yeah , of course . I 'd love to . You ... you ca n't tell him that I told you . I 'm not gon na say anything . I promise .

zone3	the rehearsal dinner . Just find a church with a really long aisle . [Laughter] Good idea . So , you 're getting married in the church ? We 've been engaged for five hours , mom . Okay . Nice . Debbie , I do n't know what your family traditions are for Christmas Eve , but Melissa and roddy and I go to midnight mass . Maybe you can get this guy to join us ? For old time 's sake ? I 'm gon na go get the luggage . Especially since it 's being offered in his father 's honor . You know , it 's 15 years this year ? I do n't need a mass to remind me . I was saying that to Debbie . Why do n't you think of it as a celebration ? It 's not an occasion I feel like celebrating . How much did they charge you to say the mass in dad 's memory , by the way ? It 's a suggested donation , and I gave more than they suggested , ' cause I want
zone3	let me lobby for your salvation . Oh , how the song remains the same . Okay , time for bed . We have a party tomorrow . Mwah ! [Laughs] Honey , I understand how someone can lose their faith in this day and age , but you get older , and it can ... mom . Oh , honey , I 'm sorry . Yes . Too much champagne . Uh , I 'm sorry for bringing all this up on your big night . I-I was just trying to ... you were just talking about the weekend . [Laughs] Yeah . The weekend . [Laughs] Oh , I 'm so glad you 're here , both of you . And I am overtired , so I 'm gon na go up , say my prayers , and thank God that you two found one another and that you decided to do something about it . [Laughs] We were the same age you are now ... now . Too many people your age wait too long . But I always thought that if you find the right person
zone3	life gets in the way and messes things up . Mom , I love you . Oh . I know . I love you , honey . He would have been so happy for you . [Laughs] I know . Really , good night . Let me assure you that this weekend is not for the church . It 's for you ... the couple as a couple . If you immerse yourself in the work of this weekend , it can be the greatest experience of your relationship so far . Who here can say that their fianc ? is the first person to whom they 've said " I love you " in an adult , romantic way ? Thank you . By most of you not raising your hand , you 've admitted that your fianc ? is not the first person you 've loved . And that 's not surprising . People get married later nowadays , but what it does suggest is that this thing that we call love is not the only thing that makes a marriage last . I mean , if it
zone3	. The feeling would be enough . Ladies and gentlemen , the road to marriage is littered with the broken plans of many wonderful couples who , with full-throated conviction , stepped to the altar and vowed the most serious of promises but then , for , oh , a variety of reasons , decided to separate . What 's with father doomsday ? Shh . And yet , you are convinced your marriage will be different . Your workbooks are for a process called t.W.O.S ... Talking , writing , openness , and sharing . And you 'll be led in some exercises by our married couple , Theresa and Mike . [Applause] All right . * let 's get this party started [laughs] All right , we 'd like you each to write down your fianc ? ' s most endearing quality and then turn and tell them . Come on . You 're an amazing friend . Your kindness . Oh , you 're actually doing this ? Two seconds . You are the most unselfish person I know . I do n't come close to my
zone3	[Both_laugh] You 're a great lay . [Chuckles] What ? Your dedication to your work . You 're good at organizing clutter . I do n't think I heard the question right . Yeah ... No . Your sense of humor . I mean , cook . Good cook . Yummy stuff always . Okay . I 'm changing mine . Everything . That ca n't be true . That ca n't be true . I knew you 'd say that , so I started a footnoted list underneath " everything , " like your smile , which conveys your deep reserves of kindness , your willingness to believe the best about people , uh , your generosity of spirit , of [laughter] , the way you focus your eyes when you 're really listening , the sigh you make after we make love ... Okay , okay . Your total determination to achieve every position from that " position of the day " desk calendar you bought me . [Laughing] We 're in a church . Look , God is all-knowing . I mean , your flexibility is no
zone3	, so try , while you 're here , to get your mind off your wedding plans ... the bridesmaid who hates her dress , the groomsman who still has n't given you his tuxedo sizes . [Laughs] Clear your head of all the expectations , all the worries , and relax . Close your eyes . Come on , come on . Close your eyes and think about the early moments right after you got engaged . Close my eyes with a priest in the room ? [Laughs] No , sir . Think about the early moments after you said " yes , " the moment after you 've leaped from hope into faith and the journey toward matrimony began . I love that we live together in New York , and yet , my mother puts us in separate bedrooms . It 's fun . You get to sneak in later . Mm-hmm . Honey , what is with the cowboy hat ? Kevin henges shaved half my head . I think I chose wisely . Are you gon na ask Kevin to be your best man at
zone3	before dawn . " Junior class writing award " ? How come I do n't know about this ? Two guys entered the contest . I wrote about my dead dad . He wrote about the virtues of cuervo . It was your first award as a writer . And my last . Does n't mean there wo n't be a next . No . No , no . We should wait until Christmas . You did n't . [Laughs] I saw you pick it up at the store that time , and you looked at it for a while . Thank you . I love it . [Both_laugh] No . Come on . The journal 's enough . " The artist 's way . " It says that if you write three pages every morning , just whatever 's on your mind , it inspires stuff , and it lets your imagination run wild . I 've become less intrigued with my imagination . Ever since you met me . No , I went back to school before I met you . I just knew I needed to do
zone3	they leave healed . I like that . I 've read your stories , and I love your stories . You moved to New York to become a writer . You know what my dream is ? You and me and our family-to-be . [Laughs] Speaking of which , maybe we should get started on making that family right now ? Shh . Your mom will hear . No . I 'm not gon na scream . I 'm not gon na scream this time , I promise . [Indistinct_conversations] Mary ... [Laughs] Who do you think has played " margaritaville " more ? Me or Jimmy buffett ? [Both_laugh] I never really liked doing drugs till I met you . Mm-hmm . Aww . [Laughs] Wait till I introduce you to cannibalism . [Laughing] What ? [Laughs] Are you kidding ? [Both_laugh] I 've never seen people eat so many cold cuts . Your platter design was irresistible . I found that meat like a caterer . Mm , mm . I 'm thinking of moving out here and starting my own business . You only got laid off
zone3	better situation . Look , I e-mailed Dave your r ? sum ? . He 's gon na get it to people . I 'm not asking you to fix it . You know , there was a time when a guy could help fix something and it was n't called fixing . It was called loving . Oh , yeah ? Oh , yeah ? Oh , yeah ? [Both_laugh] Thinks Christmas is good . [Laughing] Yes . Mcguire . Oh ! Hey , hey ! [Laughs] Kevin , you stinker . Oh , has that nativity scene ever looked better ? Yes , in 1993 , just before you drop-kicked the bear . There were no bears in Bethlehem . Mrs . mcguire , time to face the facts , huh ? I like chipmunks . Well , where is your drunken son ? In the backyard , canoodling with his fianc ? e . His what ? ! [Laughs] So ... What the fuck ? ! Merry Christmas . What the fuck ? ! [Both_laugh] Hey , kids , Santa claus is here . Hey , beautiful
zone3	out right now ? Am I that out of the loop ? No , man , no loop . Do n't tell me that there is some New York imposter best friend that you conferred with instead of me . I did n't need to confer . I just needed to do it . Kev , where 's your new girlfriend ? Uh , date . Oh , I 'm sorry . Where 's your date ? Inside bothering your mom . [Laughs] I 'll go save her . All right . Uh ... Glassy eyes , tight jeans . Oh , just my type . Mm-hmm . [Both_laugh] I 'll see you after church . Mwah ! You do n't need to represent . [Laughs] No , it 'll make your mom happy . Oh . All right . I think he 'll be a good best man . Fun best man . Yeah . [Both_laugh] I got it . Shut up . [Laughs] Cheers , asshole . Cheers , you fuck-wad . [Laughs] [Indistinct_conversations] , [laughter] Sure , your boobs get huge when you get pregnant , but
zone3	blown tires . Like , literally , two blown tires . Pbht ! Pbht ! Pbht ! I mean ... Kind of like that . So ... What 's the story ? Are you dying ? Yeah , eventually . But there has n't been a recent diagnosis of some life-ending illness ? I love her . I 'm never gon na find any better . That 's no reason to stop exploring the nether regions of all the rest of womankind . You are 28 years old , sir . Old enough to start living my life with someone else . Oh , hey , Andy Rooney , drink a beer , huh ? [Laughs] [Groans] God , global warming , huh ? I love it . [Laughs] [Laughs] Hey , I got to ask you something . If I 'm shocked ? Yes . What ? Spill it . I knew you dug her . She seems cool . But you 've only brought her back home like twice , and , yeah , I was a little buzzed both times . Yes . And , yes ,
zone3	100% fuckable ... whoa ! You were a well-traveled connoisseur of numerous vaginas before you met her . Oh , let 's do n't exaggerate . And as a fellow fan of vaginas ... can you quiet down , please ? I came out of one . I 'm allowed to use the word . [Chuckles] I 'm just saying ... to see an enthusiastic vaginal aficionado veer off course and , without warning , settle on just one , well , it is quite ... you might as admit ... portentous . Are you done ? Well ... It 's as it should be . For some sorry bastards . So , how 'd you finally know ? You know , deep down , you know pretty quickly . You just do n't admit you know because ... I do n't know ... you wait until you feel like you 're the type of man who 's worthy to ask someone to say " yes . " Who are you ? The fucking riddler ? Tell me about a blinding white light . There 's no lights . There
zone3	spend the rest of your life with someone else , and it 's picking that someone else . Well , if that 's the case , I should probably just blow my fucking head off . [Door_opens] Come on ! Come off it ! You could n't tell me over the phone ? ! Way to go ! Thanks , man . I wanted to tell you in person . Oh ! Oh , Kevin , merry Christmas . And to you , man . It 's roddy , for probably like the fifth time . [Laughs] Yeah , yeah . Sorry . I spaced my contact . Yeah , that 's what you said last year , but whatever , man . I 'll let it slip because right now , my brother-in-law 's finally getting engaged ! Oh , fantastic ! Man , you are gon na love it . It 's work , but it 's ... but it 's great . And you 're great , dom , ' cause I got the bonus . Well done . You well done , you . [Laughs] You
zone3	would have just lamed out and not gone in and got what I deserved . But I thought about what you said and I said , " dom did n't " give me this advice to make me crumble . He gave me this advice so I " could soar . " I did n't know you 'd become a motivational speaker . I walked in there channeling you . [Laughs] I said to wajowski , " I have " done over 17 installations above average , and I came to claim " what is rightfully mine . " And he just , you know , tilted his head a little , paused , ruminated on what he knew to be the truth , and then just cowered , acknowledged my above-and-beyondness and just paid me right there . He cut my bonus check right there . Oh , I 'm sorry ... right here . Nicely done . Bank that . Well , most of it . Uh , when Melissa 's " acting " " class " is over , we 're gon na splurge and hit up
zone3	, the whole deal ... my treat . No , you and Melissa spend it on yourselves . No , no . You 've got to come with . I got a ton of radisson points . We could stay on the club level , get free breakfast ... tons of different juices , the whole deal . Please , let me just give something back . We 'll get out the calendars . Yeah , we will . Oh , my God , I am so lucky I married into this family . Come here , man . I love you . Oh , I love you , too . [Laughs] I guess I 'll have to console Deb when she finds out what you 're really like . Shut up . [Laughs] How are you ? Oh , little brother , you did good . Oh , hey , Kevin . Melissa , sorry . Wow . I did n't even ... uh , holy shit , uh , you look incredible . What the hell ? Did you get lap-band surgery or something ? You must have
zone3	. Oh . Okay . Sister . Wife . [Both_laugh] Hey , roddy , you want a beer ? No , I got to go to church . I 'm gon na need hard alcohol . No shots . Oh , for you , my dear , the world and more . Mwah ! [Laughs] Look at the two of us ... the troll and the supermodel . It 's almost as if my reward , for the punishment of me having to be me , is marrying you and then having you transform into this . [Laughs] All right , you Saint Bernard , stop slobbering . So , mom wanted me to come out here to see if you 're gon na come to midnight mass . She wants to leave early to get a good seat . Well , no . I am in too good a mood to relocate to a place that will alter that mood , thank you . Are you about to reveal a priestly molestation story ? Uh , I will if it means I do n't have to go . Do
zone3	the shit out of you . Dare you . [Laughs] We 're leaving in 15 . Uh , I do n't even ... How ? The hard way ... diet and dedication . She just got tired of carrying around the extra pounds . Extra pounds ? Extra person . Dude , it 's my sister . No , I grew up with your sister . That person who was just here I have never met . I mean , she weighed two bills in junior high . Now she 's like the female subway sandwich guy . Do not say that to her . [Clears_throat] Say what you will , you ca n't stop me from fucking her in my mind . Oh , God . Melissa looks great . How 's her acting classes going ? Ugh . Unfortunately , no one 's ever written a book called " do n't follow your dreams . " [Laughter] I 'm gon na . That book will fucking change the world . Chapter 1 ... choosing the wrong dream will just fuck you up . [Laughs] You know , did
zone3	go to football camp for two weeks every summer to get better ? Yes . Did my dad run drills with me before going to work ? Yes . Did my mom make special meals to help me manage my weight ? Yes . And did I make the football team ? No , and it crushed me . It ... it crushed me , and I-i just do n't want her to be crushed . I think it 's great that she 's found something that makes her feel useful . Walk a mile , Deb . Walk a mile in my timberlands and then report back . [Bell_tolling] I thought I was marrying a size-12 retail buyer , and then , out of nowhere , at 33 years old , just some hibernating acting dream just sprouts up out of nowhere ? I mean , I 'm glad she got into shape , but , seriously , this delusion that she 's gon na be an actress has just taken ahold of her like some insatiable fungus that is devouring the common-sense part of her brain . But
zone3	? You 'll see . Why does this news make me sad ? For myself , not you . When you find a girl you want to spend the rest of your life with , you 'll ask her . Dom . D-d-dom . D-d-dom . No . Thank you . Well , what if I already found her and she wanted no part of me ? Well , you write some songs and you move on . In theory . I remember last summer , we talked on the phone for an hour about what you were gon na do when you saw her at your buddy heisner 's wedding . Oh , yeah , that wedding got moved to Montana . My credit cards are all maxed out . I never got to go , never got to confront . Well , give it another nine years . That 's the plan . Is n't she married ? Like that matters . Yeah . Burn it . It 's salvageable . What about this date you got wandering around my mother 's kitchen on Christmas Eve ? I
zone3	, luckily , I 'm still in the enigma phase with her . She has n't caught on to how useless I am as a man . Not that I 'm gon na clue her in just yet . The sex is too good . Yeah , that is when I close my eyes and ca n't see her looking back at me chock-full of expectation and hope . [Indistinct_conversations] It 's beautiful . [Laughs] Can I ask you something ? When did you know that my brother was the right one for you ? You mean when did I fall in love with him ? No , that 's not always the same thing . For me , it was . He let my father 's barbershop quartet teach him to sing . [Laughs] No . Dom has a horrible voice . Yeah , I know . He knows . But it was so important to my dad , it 's like the one important thing , and dom recognized that . So , there he was in the kitchen with my father 's barbershop-quartet friends , and they
zone3	cause it 's the one low voice that you could possibly get away with . Not if you 're tone-deaf . [Both_laugh] I know . And I just stood there baffled at my good fortune . And I thought , " I 'm really in " love with this guy . " That 's so sweet ... And specific . What about you and roddy ? Oh , I do n't know . I was smoking so much pot back then , I ca n't remember . No , we , uh ... we met at this weight-loss thing , and he was all goofy and persistent . And I do n't know . Well , you know , if there 's any true tradition on the guy 's part , for the girl , the whole proposal thing is kind of like a sneak attack . They know they 're gon na do it , but you do n't know they 're gon na do it , and then they do it and it 's great , but you 're ... You 're , like , all over the
zone3	roddy and I were engaged , she sighed . Right before , " honey " , " congratulations , " it was , like , this slight-yet-audible sigh , as if to say , " thank God my fat " daughter squeaked in . " [Laughs] Your mother adores you . Oh , no , I know . I 'm fine . I do n't think about it . That 's a line . [Laughs] That 's just my mom . That 's how she reacted , bless her heart . To mom , marriage equals happiness . Oh . Mom , what 's wrong ? I forgot to hang dad 's stocking . Santa does n't come till we 're asleep . [Sighing] Oh . Nothing like the nurturing smell of Providence back in your nasal passages , huh ? The wafting stench of the broken dreams of losers , like myself , stuck here , incapable of leaving this shithole . Still love Rhode island , huh ? Ugh ! Why do n't you pack up the truck and drive yourself across state lines . It 's a
zone3	big apple , where I 'll find true love and artistic reward ? Anything but this . Because I know a guy who moved away six years ago with Hemingway aspirations , who took a dive and became a physical therapist . There you go . There 's a dig . You know what , kev ? Every Christmas for the last seven years , we have the same conversation . We have some beers , we have some [laughs] , and then without fail , you start bitching about being stuck here like you 're on Alcatraz . Oh , Mr . getting-married-guy has finished all his thinking on all the big thoughts . He 's got his how-to guidebook on how things work ? And he 's got a few tips , huh ? Yeah . Watch what you say about my fianc ? e and watch what you say about my sister . They were compliments . You know , you come in here and you dismiss my engagement with some " are you sure ? " Bullshit . You make some crude comments about the fuckability
zone3	sister ? I was joking . Find another way to joke . It 's not funny anymore . Walk it off , dom . Dude , look at yourself ... Shit-faced and stoned . It 's Christmas ! Burying your talent , dragging around some poor girl who you 're gon na give the boot to with your well-rehearsed , fake sorry . " You 're too good for me . " Congratulations . You 've gotten back all of womankind for the one that you did n't get . Do you know what friends do ? Bitching is what friends do together . May I remind you that your first and only published short story is entitled " Providence sucks " ? You 're being a fucking asshole . That 's why I came over ! The pleasure of your company has always been that I could act like an asshole without getting reamed for it . All good times have to come to an end , right ? Oh . Hmm . Awesome , dude . Hey ! Put in that your book . I 'm glad that
zone3	'm glad that you 're so fucking complete that my meaningless bitches now bore you . Good luck with your speaking tour . Merry fucking Christmas . [Sighs] Mary , wake up ! We 're leaving ! All : * sing in exultation * word of the father * now in flesh appearing * oh , come , let us adore him * oh , come , let us adore him * oh , come , let us adore him * Christ the lord feel free to spread out all over the grounds while you write . Just be in hearing range . When I ring this bell , you should make your way back here for our next talk . Tell one another your vision of what you want your shared future to be . Okay . I know you 're gon na make a great dad . I like thinking about that ... How you 'll create a home where our kids will prosper . And you 'll love them and teach them and provide for them , and it 's powerful thinking about that and watching you
zone3	turn . I-I 'm not finished . Oh . I want to be a mom . You 'll be an amazing mom . Sometimes , I feel like I wo n't be the kind of great mom that I want to be ... I disagree . And like I wo n't be the kind of mom that can constantly get on top of things and , you know , to be a mom that does n't lose my mind . We 'll get you some valium . [Laughs] You know , it worked for my mother . Did it ? [Laughs] Not really . I do n't know . I just ... I see my cousin so stressed and snippy with tom ... yeah , that 's different people . That 's different situations . Yeah , but do you remember that time when she was loading Lucy and Brian into the van at hersheypark ? Yeah . [Laughs] Yeah . I mean , she was ... she was screaming at them and ... and they were n't listening and they were all over the place and she had her
zone3	so tired and overwhelmed . She was wild , like ferocious wild , like ... like some instinctual altered state that must have been induced by childbearing . You 're ... you 're not your cousin . Yeah , but she was n't always like that . I 'm not tom . You are Debbie . I 'm ... trying to change the subject . No . I 'm trying to end the comparison . I mean , they are they , and we are we . * you are not your cousin please do n't sing . * and I am not tom [bell_ringing] Never too late to be saved by a bell . * you , my dear Debbie , will be a great mom * you did n't read yours . I basically wrote everything I just said ... Up until the singing , of course . [All_scatting] Man , you got it . You got it ! You still want me to sing with you guys ? Yes ! You 're incredible . Gentlemen ... No more . We 've got a wedding to plan ?
zone3	deejay over here on the stage . Or ... If you want , uh , Maggie row 's son is in a band called destiny that plays all over Syracuse . Yeah , I-i do n't want Steve row playing at wedding . No , I do n't know . We could go hear him , you know . No , Steve row gave me a wedgie in the fifth grade . What ? He was flirting with you . Yeah , I 'll go give his old man a wedgie right now . What ? With your barbershop quartet ? If needs be . You know , Harry can rumble . No , if you did the lighting in here , this place could be awesome . That 's what we thought . Yeah , I was in charge of my senior prom . We turned , uh , the gym into a 1920s jazz hall . I always thought that this place would make a great speakeasy . The bridesmaids could be flappers ! Hey , wait a minute . Johnny marr has a bubble machine ! We
zone3	Definitely doable . Their pensions got decimated . I ca n't take their money . I need to generate more income . Hey , you 're gon na get that job on Tuesday , okay ? I know it . [Both_laugh] Part of the reason that our church does this program is our experience with couples who get challenged by the shift between marriage as an idea and marriage as a relationship . 1-in-10 couples who participate in this decide not to move forward with their wedding because of issues that come up over this weekend . And you know what ? That 's okay , because this weekend is about exploring one thing ... what makes this love you have for the person you sit next to a love that will thrive ? What ... what makes this love that ... that you bring to the marriage table one that will conquer all ? Yes ! Uh , high score . [Laughter] We here at the engagement encounter believe that communication is not just saying what you want and demanding that the other person agree . When we first
zone3	idea of being a mom , but I had difficulty letting go of my career . Mike was gone for long stretches , and I used to think to myself , " well , this is n't " what I thought it would be like ... waiting around for a five-minute phone call every couple of days or shuttling the kids around while he was off in Chicago or Kansas City or Boston , meeting interesting " people . " Pharmaceutical reps are n't interesting . [Laughter] Do n't let things fester . This is the time for really taking off the masks and showing who you really are . Boo . Can I read this thing I did n't read a second ago ? Of course . I do n't know why I did n't read it . I-I ... I guess I 'm embarrassed . I , um ... about what ? About how un-useful so much of what I 'm ... I 'm skilled at has turned out to be . Deb , you 're not your job . You talk about being a physical therapist ,
zone3	people , and ... and you 're right . I 'm a physical therapist . I have a degree in marketing . Which has gotten you good jobs and good benefits . Job benefits are n't life benefits . Sure they are . Before I got laid off , I never really had to examine what I was doing to define my life . You know , I-i ... I do n't know . I moved to New York to work in publishing . Publishing ... a dying industry . And ... and , you know , and I took these jobs tangentially related to that because I thought I was gon na ... I was gon na pay my dues , and I did . You 're 25 years old . Exactly . I 'm 25 years old . I 'm ... I 'm four years out of college . Maybe I should work in the red cross or something like you talk about . I just do n't want to feel like I 'm stuck somewhere with nothing to offer . I 'm not gon na let that
zone3	really nice , but , uh ... but there 's nothing . Okay . I appreciate your time . Uh , do you know who might be hiring ? I mean , I check the online boards , and everything looks so crappy . I-I thought you were hiring . [Laughs] Interviewing . We just have a hiring freeze . When there 's an interview freeze , that 's when things get really bad ... not just bad-bad , but really bad . But some people say that things are turning around . Others say that it 's going back in the dumper and that this recent rally was just a trap , and we may have to gnaw off our limbs just to survive . I mean , metaphorical limbs , but real enough to hurt . I just keep reassuring myself that somebody needs me . But do you ever feel that what you have to offer just is n't enough ? Not until recently . Hmm . Thank you for your time . [Siren_walls] You feel all right ? Good . Paging Dr . menter . Paging
zone3	improving . I hate it . I hate coming here . I hate seeing you . Well , the day after tomorrow , we 'll hate some more . If I do n't kill myself first . [Laughs] I 'll call to confirm . Hold her head underwater next time . I promise I wo n't tell . I heard that . My lungs are better than yours , Freddy , you cigarette-smoking prick . [Indistinct_conversations] , [horns_honking] Sister Mary Roberts ! It 's me , Christine . Oh , sister Mary Roberts , you look great . I 'm sorry . I 'm not ... how was your mission in Guatemala ? Uh , still a lot of pagans there , I believe , right ? The ... the numbers have dwindled , but we 're ... we 're making progress . Oh , people would worship anything , would n't they ? Look at us here . Look at all the odd stuff . But still , it is comforting . Besides , you have to bet on something , especially at my age . [Chuckles] I hope
zone3	's so nice to see you back at our parish . We need more people here with your devotion . God bless . Oh ! Seriously , stop . Come on . Give it back . Jennifer , if he hurts me , I want you to be my therapist . [Laughs] I can hardly take care of myself . " Wedding budget . " I thought the bride 's parents paid . Yeah , well , they 're retired . You 're nice . Or stupid . Now I feel bad that I 'm about to borrow cigarette money . [Laughs] Why do you support his habit ? Because I want him to die young . Get in line . Oh , hey , tonight , at the therapy pool , annual naked cannonball competition . Who 's in ? Besides Jen . Look , this is an annual thing , Jen , where you get in the pool where we heal people and turn it into a cannonball frolic . [Laughs] Dom , you take it easy . You take a load off . I 'll see you
zone3	. " O " team to icu . So , how 's the plans going ? Great . Just crunching numbers , basically . You need me to cook ? I 'm no gourmet chef , but you get me a pot that 's big enough , I can make pasta to feed 100 . Yeah ? That 's about it . [Both_laugh] Pasta , house salad , brownies . I owe you . No , you do n't . It was a bad way to be introduced , stumbling across me crying in a stairwell . Hey , it 's a hospital . We 're used to people crying . Not some silly girl weeping over some dumb dude I fell in love with . Yeah . Has he called back yet ? He says he 's still confused . Screw him . That was the goal , at least one last time . [Both_laugh] Well , it 's a half day for me . I got to go pick out a wedding cake . Oh , do n't get one with a lot of flowers . That 's
zone3	frosting petals . My sister got real flowers to sprinkle on top . It looked just as nice . Cost less . Good tip . [Both_laugh] Uh , more people like chocolate than vanilla . Keep the tips coming . Much obliged . [Indistinct_conversations] [Siren_walls] [Door_opens] Hey ! Hi . You 're home early . Took a half day from work to meet you at turnover 's . Remember ? Oh , my God . I left you a bunch of messages . I just figured your phone died . I 'm so sorry . I-I turned off my phone , and then I guess I forgot I turned off my phone . It 's okay . I 'm sorry , dom . You 've got to try this , okay ? Oh , my God . You 're not mad at me ? No . I 'm saving my anger for something ... Important . [Both_laugh] Oh , my God , that 's really good . Is n't that incredible ? [Laughs] How much ? Well , they 're $600 or we can get the same cake . We
zone3	money , less sugar . That 's right . I 've seen that . Have n't you ? Where do you come up with these amazing ideas ? [Laughs] You taste like cake . So do you . [Laughs] Ah , leave it . How do I make you see what I see ? How do I make you want what I want ? That door . That door you 're thinking about going through ... it 's a real door . It 's a real door that will shut all by itself once you go through it . Ca n't you see that ? You can make the wrong move . You can twist your fate . You can take a road that you think is right and awaken and find that it 's all wrong . It 's all ... Wrong . Do n't you understand what I 'm saying ? Love me . Love me . [Crying] Love me . [Cheers_and_applause] Easy on the applause . We 're trying to stay in the scene and do strong work , not perform for results or applause . Melissa
zone3	moments you were pushing . I just got a little caught up . [Laughs] If you 're gon na do all the feeling for us , we do n't have to feel at all , right ? We can just kick back and detach . We do n't have to participate , right ? We can just judge whether or not your display of emotion is authentic . And we 're gon na do that regardless . [Laughter] But there 's mystery if you give us room to lean in a little , to participate , to wonder . At the moment when your heart is breaking , I want to see you trying desperately to not cry . I wo n't make that mistake again . [Laughs] Class is the place for mistakes . Mistakes lead us to deeper truths . You dug deep . Nice work . See you all Friday . [Indistinct_conversations] [Sniffles] Oh . What a nice surprise ! I texted you . I was looking for tuxedos a few blocks from here . I thought you could come along , help make sure I do
zone3	my phone off in class . I did n't get the text . I 'm sorry . Hey , this is my class . Yeah . This is my teacher , James . James , this is dom , my brother . I was telling him about you . Oh , hey , man . Nice to meet you . Yeah , you too . You 're the reason she got started here , right ? Yeah , I bought her a birthday present of some acting classes , you know , wherever she wanted to take them . Well , we 're glad she chose here . Did you catch that last scene ? Yeah , I caught the end , and I got to tell you ... I was not detached at all . I was absorbed and fully into it . Good . That 's what we 're going for . But nice to meet you . We shall see you Friday . Okay . Incredible . Thanks . Your teacher 's taken quite a shine to you . He 's proud . Proud and grabby .
zone3	Friday . You ? My showcase is coming up . James thinks I 'm gon na get an agent . I ca n't go . We got to get mom to move here . Yeah , she can chaperone you in acting class . It 's good . He 's like that with everyone . It 's more ironic than actual . I do n't know what that means . Well , I ca n't explain it then . Yeah . Just watch out , okay ? I think I saw him trying to undo your bra strap . [Both_laugh] You know , would it kill you to let me be the pretty girl for once ? Okay . [Both_laugh] * untethered and free * floating out to the sea * I need you to look after me * it 's now summer long * it 's a cold winter 's dawn * I better , I better keep moving on * * I need you to care while I 'm gone * [engine_shuts_off] [Birds_chirping] Mom ? I 'm back here , dom ! What are you doing ? !
zone3	! [Sighs] Get down ! Oh ? King of the world , huh ? A leaky roof does n't mean I need to sell the house . You want real marshmallows or fluff ? Fluff , please . [Liquid_pouring] So , you do n't want to live in . New York City near your kids ? Uh , you mean , uh , do I want to be cooped up in a tiny apartment , which I ca n't afford , in a city without friends , while my two adult children are busy with their lives ? No . I 'm never too busy for you . Oh , yes , you are , and it 's okay . You 've got your own life . I do miss you and your sister and I wish you lived closer . I miss being a parent and , you know , having influence in your lives . I think I would be so much better at it now . Yeah , I-i know more . Mom , stop . That conversation that we had at Christmas ? I got to
zone3	, how I handled ... you handled it as well as you could have . I did it badly . No . Trying to get you to feel joy about some idea about ultimately being reunited with daddy in heaven . There 's nothing joyful about a boy losing his father . You did great . Seriously . We were all in the same boat , and we did great . I mean it . I could n't have landed a girl like Deb without being raised by a mom like you , could I ? You sweetie . Want some fluff ? No . Some cocoa ? * I ca n't be clear , but all I want to say * * I 'm a wreck since the day you 've gone * * I try to fit things together , and it seeps through * * it does n't seem to matter what I do * * I 'm useless without you , dear * * I 'm useless without you * my dear [cheers_and_applause] Great show , man . Thanks . I should have minded my own
zone3	mouth . You should play that last one at our reception . I 'm invited ? Yeah , if you be my best man . You got really low standards , you know ? Yeah , I do . Hey , do n't go wasting your vow on me . [Laughs] To friendship and longevity , to forgiveness and to an elimination of jackassery , except for occasional glimpses that harm no one . Cheers . Cheers . Mary ? [Laughs] What ? Is that Mary ? Yes . Things sort of fell apart after Christmas . So , I get to host the bachelor party . Oh . Seriously . Oh , rest yourself . Rest yourself , son . It 's gon na be all taken care of . Do n't you think about a thing . There will be no shenanigans . There may be drunken ... there will be drunkenness , but there will be no shenanigans . Do you understand ? There ... there 's gon na be drunkenness . I got you . Your voice sounded great tonight , by the way , man
zone3	and no tobacco . Nice ! Good for you . That 's good . Yeah . Well , this is my problem . I never thought I was designing a wee little life with tiny victories like not smoking pot for consecutive days or finally posting my songs on a website for people to disparage . Your songs about Betsy kill me . [Chuckles] I 'm serious . You know , that song you wrote about sister Julie 's English class says more in three minutes about growing up than I ever could in a novel . Oh ... No , no , no . Maybe ... maybe a song you write helps someone ... Miserable existence . Make sense out of their life , you know ? Mm . You just ... you got to ... you got to just progress with that in your mind , you know ? Maybe it 's time I came down to New York . There you go . Betsy just got divorced . Congratulations . [Both_laugh] Okay . Wow . We continue with an exercise called awareness . It 's designed to
zone3	that you have differences in . As we read off some statements , we want you to move to the other side of the lawn if you agree with what that statement says . If you disagree , stay put . Mike , you want to kick us off ? Thank you , father . You ready ? " I always squeeze the toothpaste from the bottom of the tube . " [Both_laugh] I guess . Uh , what if you buy toothpaste that comes in that upright pump thingy ? Well , be thankful that you have one less thing to argue about . Okay , you can go back to your starting point . " I prefer red wine to white wine . " " I like to vacation alone sometimes . " " I would be willing to move " " to advance my spouse 's career . " Where are you going ? With you . Injured people are everywhere . " I would like to have kids . " [Laughter] " I would like to have more " " than two kids . " Wait
zone3	was hoping yours , but I 'm open . [Laughs] Okay . [Laughs] Let 's do another one . " Going to church regularly is important to me . " Okay , try and recall when you and your fianc ? are on opposite sides . Those may be areas to discuss . I mean , obviously , toothpaste is not as important as how many kids you want . Okay , that 'll be it for today . I 've been going to church . [Birds_squawking] Hi , Emma . [Chuckles] Oh , thank you for the invite tonight , but , um , I 'm actually meeting up with this guy I went to college with . My mother thinks I should go . She said it would be good medicine for me to talk to somebody who knew me way back when . [Chuckles] I do n't know . I should probably just blow it off . I do n't really feel like good company these days , and from what I recall , neither was he . Oh , yeah , good idea . [Laughs] Oh
zone3	Yeah . Okay . Talk to you tomorrow . Bye . [Ringing] [Beep] Dom , it 's roddy , man . I do n't even know where the hell I am right now . I was at the javits center doing demos , and my bag with all my shit got ripped off . My fucking wallet , my keys , my laptop just gone . Uh , I was doing a demo for that douche-bag sales guy Craig derno . He said he was gon na watch my bag , but he did not , and now I 'm stranded . So , please . Uh , I 've tried to call Melissa , but she 's at class till late night , so I 'm walking to your place , man . Deb , I 've been with you every Sunday for the last year and a half . During the week . I 've been going during the week . When ? Most days . Most ? Yeah , lately . For how long have you been doing this ? About six ... about eight weeks .
zone3	. [Hard-rock_music_playing] [Knock_on_door] Yeah ! Coming ! Oh , Kevin . Roddy . Hey . Oh , you making lasagna ? Uh ... R-roddy ? So , dom just lent you his keys , even after the Christmas dust-up ? I 'm helping a friend lay down some demos in Brooklyn . You do n't have one of those fake rocks that you hide a key in ? No . Uh , I have a brother-in-law who has a spare key somewhere , but at this point , I 'll probably just wait till Melissa 's acting class lets out and then head back with her . Yeah , what time is that ? 11:00 . Mm . On a Friday night ? Dude , do n't poke the bear . Trust me ... I am already overchafed about the situation . Hey , who 's that chippy you got coming over ? Just a friend from college . I 'll lend you 20 bucks for a bus back to Jersey . I 'd have you stay , but I 'm just not sure that I got enough for three
zone3	You know , every day that I asked you how your day was , never once did you say , " I spent " it in church . " I do n't spend the day . I-I go to mass . I-I walked by the church one day and I went in and I found something about the ritual that I really missed , something that I had when I was a kid and a teenager . I went to a jesuit college even . Yeah , but hold on . This might be all easier to choke down if I 'd observed your religious re-awakening in incremental portions , instead of having it , you know , thrust on me here at catholic camp . I mean , come on , Deb . I thought we were on the same page . I 'm sorry I sprung it on you . I ... Do you want to leave ? Not without you . Are you sure ? Deb , stop saying that , okay ? I 'm here , I 'm participating , I 'm doing all the exercises
zone3	'm reading what I wrote , am I not ? You are . I want to go to bed on my deluxe 3-inch mattress in my warm and cozy four-star dormitory . Hey . Man . What ? She was finished . Look , I 'm sorry about your divorce . Well , you ca n't convince someone to fix a mistake if they do n't think that they 've made one . Debatable . You know why my marriage works ? I-I 'm becoming more and more intrigued . Because I am blind to the alternative . Still here , still here , still here , still here , still here . I love you . [Beep] You see , it 's way too easy to leave somebody nowadays , you know ? Friends of friends , families , everyone everywhere ... everyone is way too understanding of other people 's , you know , reasons to leave . You ca n't judge other people 's ... oh , sure you can . You do . We all do . Most people just do n't do it out loud
zone3	need a good old dosage of some out-loud , full-frontal condemnation in this world . It works . Take my buddy freitsel from umass . He got married a while ago . I went , you know , and I listened to the priest give a homily about how the guests at the wedding were witnesses , but , more importantly , they were sentinels . You know , we are standing guard over that wedded couple . You know , we got the watch , and we are on watch forever . So , last summer , freitsel calls . You know , he says he 's having some trouble with bridget ... That 's his wife 's name ... you know , and ... but , you know , friction , you know , kind of hinting that it might be unfixable . So I 'm like , " oh , buddy , you " know , hang in there , man . " It 's gon na be all right . " You know , the usual . But I told dom , and dom 's like
zone3	I 'm like , " why ? " And he said , " go be a sentinel . " And he was right . Boom ! I drive over to freitsel 's place , I sit him down , and I said , " I can not let you do this . " You can not give up . " I owe you this . " Who wants coffee ? I 'll get it . And he 's like ... he 's like , " hey , roddy , lay off , man . I 'm only human . " I 'm like , " you 're only human ? ! " So what ? You 're only required to work it out if you 're a klingon ? Only Mr . Spock 's got to dig " deep ? " I says , " guy , your humanity is " not in dispute here . " Your humanity is the problem . " You really got this judging thing down . Look , I 'm just saying ... you know , at first , he was resistant . He
zone3	. She stayed . And now they are thriving . Thriving . [Echoing] Thriving . Hey , uh , are you getting a wi-fi signal down here ? Nope . I 'm typing some notes out tonight . Is ... is there gon na be a test ? That is a cool blouse . Oh , thank you . I was n't sure how to dress . Yeah , I thought it might be dressy , but it 's kind of like summer camp . For Jesus freaks . I like it . I mean , some of it 's kind of hard , but I feel like it 's making us closer . Well , I feel like I 'm a grown-up , and it 's all a little too instructive and rah-rah for me . Oh , could I borrow some of your ... Yeah . Mm-hmm . Dental floss . Thank you . You 're welcome . You know , I 'm getting a lot out of it , too . I feel closer to my fianc ? . Hey , uh , dom ? Philip .
zone3	no , thanks . We could really take some money from these jokers . I 'm good . Okay . [Chuckles] Are you catholic ? No , but my fianc ? is , so I 'm dealing . He promised me reciprocity-free oral if I made it through . Whatever . Forced conversation is not my bag . And neither are these Halloween decorations hanging everywhere . I mean , what kind of sick shit is this ? I get it ... he ... he died on the cross for our sins . Awesome . I do n't need to be haunted by his blood and guts hanging out everywhere . [Knock_on_door] Tracy , are you in there ? I 'll be there in a second , Chad . Geez ! I 'll be in the car . Are you okay ? What happened ? [Sighs] My fianc ? keeps saying he does n't know why he signed up for this . He does n't know why we ca n't sleep in the same bed . We 're both adults . And he is miserable . [Breathes_deeply] And so he
zone3	from okay . We can leave if we want to ? [Snoring] There 's a church on 82nd street that Lindsay told me about . Wait , wait , wait . When did church come back into the equation ? You 've suffered through enough of our friends 's weddings in churches . What 's one more ? Especially if it 's gon na alleviate some of the stress of planning . Look , it 's not as easy as , " hey , let us use your church for free . " There are rules . I mean , they have this program called pre-cana , where they ... They basically need to approve you . It actually sounded kind of nice . They ... they have this retreat called engagement encounter . [Chuckles] We get to go away for the weekend . An entire weekend ? [Snoring_continues] [Sighs] [Crickets_chirping] [Snoring_continues] Dom . I went to leave you a note , and , um ... You found my journal and you asked , " what would Jesus do ? " Do you want to be with her instead of
zone3	the word " could . " " Could " as in you wanted to or " could " as in if the circumstances were different ? Unbelievable . Do you want the circumstances to be different ? No . You can be honest with me . When have I not been honest with you ? These things that you wrote ... I was doing my three pages a day . I was flushing it out . I was putting it on the page unfiltered , like the book that you gave me suggested . I 'm just interested where these thoughts about her came along and when you thought it was okay to write them in your journal ? ! Look , I 'm here with you , okay ? What good is being here with me when you 're writing about some slut you work with . She 's not a slut . You 're defending her ? No . I 'm being honest . She made a pass at you . She tried to . I was n't there . Well , it seems like you were .
zone3	you ? I do n't know . You tell me , Nancy drew . Just before easter . Okay , can we step ... it 's documented , babe ! Can we just move away from the building ? No , it is documented , okay ? Everybody from work had Thursday night drinks . I pushed her away . After you lured her to make a move . What are you talking about ? You made her a mix . Yes , I made her a mix of tunes that I listen to at work . Do n't you see how I can interpret that as cultivating intimacy ? No , I did n't think of your interpretation , because I was like , " here are those tunes . " And she was like , " thanks . " So , while I 'm at home trying to find my next shitty temp job , you 're off ... what ? Road-testing my replacement ? I 'm telling you ... I 'm not . Then what was with the bath oils ? Oh , this is insane !
zone3	you see how that 's kind of fucked up ? I was her secret Santa . So buy her a pad of post-it notes , buy her , you know , a new ace bandage , something that ... That physical therapists buy for one another , not some Spanish-fly sex kit for her to rub all over her breasts . I thought it was a nice gift . You liked the one's my mom bought for you . You bought some for Karen . You talked about it for 15 minutes over dinner with Bob and Stacy . You said you loved it . So ? Yeah , I loved it because I was amazed at how something so simple could make me feel so relaxed and cared for and girly . And then we had an amazing night of lovemaking after you drew a bath for me to try the bath oils in . And then you go and buy her the same fucking bath oils ? ! She ... she just started working there , okay ? I found her in the stairwell crying because her boyfriend
zone3	ask you to marry me . I was feeling so lucky . But for her , it was shaping up to be a pretty shitty holiday season . So when I picked her name out of a hat the next day , I decided it would be nice for me to buy her something nice . So I went to Duane reade and dropped $12 and spread some holiday cheer . So you gave her a shoulder to cry on , some advice on love , a mix tape to listen to while she rubs her bath oils all over her naked body , and she adds up these gestures as an invitation to fall for you , which she does , and then she lets this be known , all gooey-eyed and ... and gushy with her lips parted , which sends you swooning and swirling and ... she was crying in the stairwell . Oh , my God ! And I bet she was all " sniffle " , " sniffle , " and you were all , " there , there . " Okay , I am
zone3	. You 're putting things together , and they do n't go together that way . But things you wrote ! Yes , the things I wrote ! Whatever was in my journal had a right to be there , and you had none . Uh ... Take $20 . No , man . I do n't want to take your strip-club stash . [Both_laugh] All right , seriously , we 're just gon na go for a walk . You okay ? I 'm fine . I 'm gon na go down to where her acting classes are . She usually gets ... [Yawning] Coffee around the corner . Um ... Her friends ... oh , God , her friends . [Chuckles] They 're so self-centered . They never ask me a question about how I am doing , but alas , yet again , I am in a situation where I have to suck it up and deal , so ... Thank you for dinner . Yeah . And thank you for conversation . Sometimes misfortune leads to a nice night , right ? That 's a beautiful
zone3	beautiful people . Oh . You 're adorable . You 're the most adorable of the two . Okay , bye . [Crickets_chirping] You still wear that necklace what's-his-fuck gave you , right ? What has that got to ... because we 're discussing cultivating thoughts of intimacy . My wearing this necklace is not cultivating thoughts of intimacy with Gary Thompson . Talk to Gary Thompson ? I saw him a couple months ago . Oh , really ? Where ? Church ? I saw him outside a diner . So , why did n't you mention that to me ? " Oh , hey , I had lunch with Gary Thompson . " We did n't have lunch . Oh , have lunch , split a burger , throw back some brews , have a soulful visit . I had a coffee . He 's still friends with a bunch of my friends from Georgetown . He is a dirtbag who stole money from you , and yet , you still feel the need to cozy up and reminisce . Hey , congratulations , by the way .
zone3	here doing a recording . Oh , for a friend for free . What ? Like I 'm painting ? For years of art classes , preparing me for anything but a desk job , and what am I doing ? You 're in human resource . You are a resource for humans to reference their humanity . Yeah , well , I thought it was just a phase , and now , seven years later , somehow a phase has become my life . You 've been through a lot . Other people have been through worse . It matches the bracelet you bought for me . Before I knew fuck-face bought it for you five years ago . It 's just a necklace . And it 's just a journal , thoughts . Thoughts come and go . I mean , do you pray out loud at the kitchen table for me to listen in ? No ? Why ? Why all the secrets , huh ? This is different . This is different . If you think this matters to me ... I mean , you told
zone3	? I could give a shit . It 's fake ! Well , do n't Chuck the bracelet , ' cause that 's real . How real are your feelings for her ? Words on a page . Words buried by other words , words you may not have had a chance to get to tonight , words about us , about our wedding , about how much of a good thing I have with you . Did you read that ? That 's in there , too . Did you read what I wrote yesterday before we came to this godforsaken place ? Did n't you read all the things I wrote about you ? How we doing over here ? Oh , fucking phenomenal , father . Thank you . Nine years . Back of a burger king . I welled up . You walked off . Back of a burger king . How sad is that ? It was a long time ago . It was a nightmare . Torch-carrying fool . I had a boyfriend . You always had a boyfriend . [Laughs] We were best
zone3	. This is my one-step recovery program , apologizing to you face-to-face for putting you in that situation ... And then abandoning our friendship when I did n't get what I wanted in return . And ... I was an ass . It has impacted me more than you could possibly know . And ... Still . I 'm sorry . There . I said it . God . Of course , it took me nine years . I was married for half of those nine years . I was n't always up for chatting , especially about the past . Hey , should we get more alcohol ? Actually , I 'm trying to cut back . Ugh . I tried to keep a straight face . [Laughs] But I really like alcohol . [Laughs] Can we start with a prayer ? No , I 'm not in the mood for praying . And , honestly , father ... You ... I mean , not you personally , but the collective you ... have been fucking up my shit for a long fucking time . I 'm really sorry
zone3	, I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry for swearing . I-I-i do n't mean any disrespect . Thank you for taking some time . How have we been fucking up your shit ? Making me go to confession when I was 8 . Let 's start there . What sin does an 8-year-old need to confess ? You 'd be surprised . When I was an altar boy , I dropped a communion wafer and got cuffed so hard by the priest that my ear rang for two days . Dom , he 's trying to help . No , just ... just ... just so we 're clear . You ca n't drop them , but you can put them in your mouth and chew them . I can understand how bewildering that could be ... no , no , no . Bewildering is our parish priest telling me , when I was 12 , that my father 's death was my cross to bear for the rest of my life . Jesus only had to carry the cross for a couple hours , and he knew he
zone3	'd like that prize package . Faith is a struggle . Thi is a struggle . This is a struggle . I-I-i came here because I thought it was the right thing to do , but now it is clear that it was absolutely the wrong thing to do , because we were getting along great before the church came into it . And you people , with your , uh ... Identifying of obstacles . You fucking create obstacles . I left a note in his journal . It was supposed to be a surprise . Oh , yeah , it was a real surprise , all right . [Sighs] You know , father , I had faith when I was a kid ' cause I ate what was put on my plate . And then , well , you know , loved one gets struck down by a Chevy impala , and you do n't even get a drunk driver to blame . Just some icy roads , bad luck , and a dead dad . And it makes no sense . But you people tried to make
zone3	him in paradise , that he planned it that way . You told me to find purpose in the pain . Losing a parent can be painful . And I did n't tell you this to give you some sort of " aha " moment , some revelation to unlock the mystery of me . My dad died . I bummed out . I got over it . Losing your faith is not uncommon ... I did n't lose my faith . It did n't deliver what it said it would . And upon further reflection , I decided to treat it the same way it treated me ... with contempt . You tell me to pray to God when things are good , pray to God when things are bad , and be happy with whatever answer he gives you . Here 's what I 've learned so far . Everything is arbitrary . Most things are n't easy . Fucked-up shit happens to a lot of people , so just pray it does n't happen to you . But what does all this have to do with you
zone3	faith in an ever-changing religion that has cut and pasted as it sees fit , but she ca n't place her faith in me . And all I 've done to prove to you that I am dedicated , to show you that my actions speak louder than words . Why ca n't she ... why ca n't she have faith in me ? I just do n't know when I became the type of person who gets in these situations . You felt something real and you followed it . I know that sounds like acting-school garbage , but it just happens to be true . What this is , what we have ... I 've never had it before . Everything you say makes him sound like a jerk . I have n't told you the ways in which he 's been nice . When has he ever been nice ? He loved me when I was ugly . How many TV shows do you think you need to see to know that you should n't cheat on your wife at home , because she just might walk
zone3	in , and they 're going at it . And at first , I could n't even assemble the pictures . Then I screamed , made a scene , took all of her things , and threw them in the hallway . I smashed his laptop on the floor , and I knew he did n't back that shit up , like , ever . And then I was like , " what the " fuck ? " That was my moment of eloquence . My entire marriage had been upended , and all I could come up with was , " what the fuck ? " What 'd he say ? He shrugged . How do you go from a vow to a shrug ? I can hardly profess to know you both . The fact that you 're here , talking this out , even shouting this out , rather than running ... Well , that , to me , is a manifestation of God 's presence . Rely on it . There 's a lot of muscularity to your words ... from both of you . And
zone3	and , you know , sometimes it is . Be gentle with one another , look for the good and noble in one another , look for the reason why you want to get married . Write it out , shout it out , share it . It 's okay to try hard . It 's okay to feel like you 're trying hard . You know , in the mass , we talk about how Jesus wanted to carry some of our struggle and our hurt . Invite him to do so . I hope I see you tomorrow . [Door_opens] , closes Debbie . [Paper_thuds] I 'm sorry . I 'm dragging down the whole night . Oh , but you 're doing it so well . [Laughs] My mom says that I have to stop it with the angst . She considers anything that she does n't want to have to listen to as angst . Your husband betrayed you . [Chuckles] If processing a heartbreak 's now considered angst , then there 's no hope for any of us . [Laughs] But , uh ... I
zone3	stupid shit that I need to deal with . Love ai n't stupid shit . Wanting something with another person that is lasting and true is an elemental yearning . I think a friend of mine told me that , recently , even . But it 's true , right ? It 's not stupid shit . I just want to meet a good guy . Like , it does n't matter if he 's from a good family . I 'll start my own good family , but I ca n't start without the guy . [Chuckles] And I 'm not saying that I only identify myself in juxtaposition to a guy . I just ... I like guys . [Laughs] I-I 'm a fan of the whole guy-girl thing .

zone3	4868469 subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd This is a film about one very simple question . How did we get here ? These are the elements and compounds from which all humans are made . They 're incredibly , almost embarrassingly common . In fact , almost 99% of the human body is a mixture of air , water , coal and chalk , with traces of other slightly more exotic elements like iron , zinc , phosphorus and sulphur . In fact , I 've estimated that the elements which make up the average human cost at most a few pounds . But somehow , trillions of these very ordinary atoms conspire miraculously to organise themselves into thinking , breathing , living human beings . How the wonders of creation are assembled from such simple building blocks , is surely the most intriguing question we can ask . You may think that answering it is beyond the realm of science . But that 's changing . For the first time , I believe science has pushed past religion and philosophy in daring to tackle this most fundamental of questions . This film is the story of a series
zone3	of nature . That woven into its simplest and most basic laws , is a power to be unpredictable . It 's about how inanimate matter with no purpose or design , can spontaneously create exquisite beauty . It 's about how the same laws that make the universe chaotic and unpredictable , can turn simple dust into human beings . It 's about the discovery that there is a strange and unexpected relationship between order and chaos . The natural world really is one great , blooming , buzzing confusion . It 's a mess of quirky shapes and blotches . What patterns there are , are never quite regular , and never seem to repeat exactly . The idea that all this mayhem , all this chaos , is underpinned , indeed determined , by mathematical rules , and that we can work out what those rules might be , runs counter to our most dearly held intuitions . So not surprisingly , the first man to really take on the momentous task of unravelling nature 's mysterious mathematics , had a very special and unusual mind .
zone3	. He was born in 1912 , in London . His name was Alan Turing . Alan Turing was a remarkable man , one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived . He discovered many of the fundamental ideas that underpin the modern computer . Also , during the Second World War , he worked here at Bletchley Park , just outside today 's Milton Keynes , in what was then a secret government project called Station X , which was set up to crack the German military codes . The Station X code breakers proved highly effective , and Turing 's contribution was crucial . The work he personally did to crack German naval codes , saved thousands of Allied lives and was a turning point in the war . But code breaking was just one aspect of Turing 's genius . Just one part of his uncanny ability to see patterns that are hidden from the rest of us . For Turing , the natural world offered up the ultimate codes . And over the course of his life he 'd come tantalisingly close to cracking them .
zone3	realised that there was this possibility that simple mathematical equations might describe aspects of the biological world . And no-one had thought of that before . Of all nature 's mysteries , the one that fascinated Turing most was the idea that there might be a mathematical basis to human intelligence . Turing had very personal reasons for believing in this . It was the death of this young man , Christopher Morcom , who ... Alan Turing , well , he was gay , and it had been the great emotional thing of his life at that point . Christopher Morcom suddenly died . And , Alan Turing was obviously very emotionally disturbed by this . But you can see that he wanted to put this in an intellectual context , a scientific context . And the question he wanted to put into context was what happens to the mind ? What is it ? Turing became convinced that mathematics could be used to describe biological systems , and ultimately intelligence . This fascination would give rise to the modern computer , and later in Turing 's life ,
zone3	simple mathematical description could be given for a mysterious process that takes place in an embryo . The process is called morphogenesis , and it 's very puzzling . At first , all the cells in the embryo are identical . Then , as this footage of a fish embryo shows , the cells begin to clump together , and also become different from each other . How does this happen ? With no thought , no central co-ordination ? How do cells that start off identical , know to become say , skin , while others become part of an eye ? Morphogenesis is a spectacular example of something called self-organisation . And before Turing , no-one had a clue how it worked . Then , in 1952 , Turing published this , his paper with the world 's first mathematical explanation for morphogenesis . The sheer chutzpah of this paper was staggering . In it , Turing used a mathematical equation of the kind normally seen in papers on astronomy or atomic physics , to describe a living process . No-one had done anything like this . Crucially
zone3	, describe how a biological system could self-organise . They showed that something smooth and featureless can develop features . One of the astonishing things about Turing 's work was that starting with the description of really very simple processes governed by very simple equations , by putting these together , suddenly complexity emerged . The pattern suddenly came out as a natural consequence . And I think in many ways this was very , very unexpected . In essence , Turing 's equations described something quite familiar , but which no-one had thought of in the context of biology before . Think of the way a steady wind blowing across sand creates all kinds of shapes . The grains self-organise into ripples , waves and dunes . This happens , even though the grains are virtually identical , and have no knowledge of the shapes they become part of . Turing argued that in a very similar way , chemicals seeping across an embryo might cause its cells to self-organise into different organs . These are Turing 's own very rough scribblings of how this might work . They
zone3	these strange blobs and patches . In his paper , he refined his sketches to show how his equations could spontaneously create markings similar to those on the skins of animals . Turing went around showing people pictures saying , " Does n't this look a bit like the patterns on a cow ? " And everyone sort of went , " What is this man on about ? " But actually , he knew what he was doing . They did look like the patterns of a cow , and that 's one of the reasons why cows have this dappled pattern or whatever . So , an area where mathematics had never been used before , pattern formation in biology , animal markings , suddenly the door was opened and we could see that mathematics might be useful in that sort of area . So even though Turing 's exact equations are not the full story , they are the first piece of mathematical work that showed there was any possibility of doing this kind of thing . Of course , we now know that morphogenesis is much
zone3	In fact , the precise mechanism of how DNA molecules in our cells interact with other chemicals , is still fiercely debated by scientists . But Turing 's idea that whatever is going on is , deep down , a simple mathematical process , was truly revolutionary . I think Alan Turing 's paper is probably the cornerstone in the whole idea of how morphogenesis works . What it does is it provides us with a mechanism , something that Darwin did n't , for how pattern emerges . Darwin , of course , tells us that once you have a pattern and it is coded for in the genes , that may or may not be passed on , depending on circumstances . But what it does n't do is explain where that pattern comes from in the first place . That 's the real mystery . And so , what Turing had done was to suddenly provide an accessible chemical mechanism for doing this . That was amazing . Turing was onto a really big , bold idea . But sadly , we can only speculate how his
zone3	his groundbreaking paper on morphogenesis , a dreadful and completely avoidable tragedy destroyed his life . After his work breaking codes at Bletchley Park , you might well have assumed that Turing would have been honoured by the country he did so much to protect . This could n't be further from the truth . What happened to him after the war was a great tragedy , and one of the most shameful episodes in the history of British science . The same year Turing published his morphogenesis paper , he had a brief affair with a man called Arnold Murray . The affair went sour and Murray was involved in a burglary at Turing 's house . But when Turing reported this to the police , they arrested him as well as Murray . In court , the prosecution argued that Turing , with his university education , had led Murray astray . He was convicted of gross indecency . The judge then offered Turing a dreadful choice . He could either go to prison , or sign up to a regime of female hormone injections to cure him
zone3	it was to send him into a spiral of depression . On 8 June 1954 , Turing 's body was found by his cleaner . He 'd died the day before by taking a bite from an apple he 'd laced with cyanide , ending his own life . Alan Turing died aged just 41 . The loss to science is incalculable . Turing would never know that his ideas would inspire an entirely new mathematical approach to biology , and that scientists would find equations like his really do explain many of the shapes that appear on living organisms . Looking back , we now know Turing had really grasped the idea that the wonders of creation are derived from the simplest of rules . He had , perhaps unexpectedly , taken the first step to a new kind of science . The next step in the story was just as unexpected , and in many ways , just as tragic as Turing 's . In the early 1950s , around the time of Turing 's seminal paper on morphogenesis , a brilliant Russian chemist by the name of
zone3	of nature . Deep behind the iron curtain , in a lab at the Soviet Ministry of Health , he was beginning to investigate the way our bodies extract energy from sugars . Just like Turing , Belousov was working on a personal project , having just finished a distinguished career as a scientist in the military . In his lab , Belousov had formulated a mixture of chemicals to mimic one part of the process of glucose absorption in the body . The mix of chemicals sat on the lab bench in front of him , clear and colourless while being shaken . As he mixed in the final chemical , the whole solution changed colour . Now this is n't particularly remarkable . If we mix ink into water , it changes colour . But then something happened that made no sense at all . The mixture began to go clear again . Belousov was astounded . Chemicals can mix together and react . But they should n't be able to go back on themselves , to apparently unmix without intervention . You can change from a clear
zone3	not back again ? And it got weirder . Belousov 's chemicals did n't just spontaneously go into reverse . They oscillated . They switched back and forth from coloured to clear , as if they were being driven by some sort of hidden chemical metronome . With meticulous care , he repeated his experiments again and again . It was the same every time . His mixture would cycle from clear to coloured and back again , repeatedly . He 'd discovered something that was almost like magic , a physical process that seemed to violate the laws of nature . ' Convinced he 'd discovered something of great importance , Belousov ' wrote up his findings , keen to share his discovery with the wider world . ' But when he submitted his paper to a leading Russian scientific journal , ' he received a wholly unexpected and damning response . ' The editor of the journal told Belousov that his findings in the lab were quite simply impossible . They contravened the fundamental laws of physics . The only explanation was that Belousov had made a mistake
zone3	fit for publication . ' The rejection crushed Belousov . ' Deeply insulted by the suggestion his work had been botched , ' he abandoned his experiments . ' Soon he gave up science altogether . ' The tragic irony was that , divided as they were by the Iron Curtain , Belousov never encountered Turing 's work . For if he had , he would have been completely vindicated . It turns out that Belousov 's oscillating chemicals , far from contravening the laws of physics , were actually a real world example of precisely the behaviour Turing 's equations predicted . While the connection might not appear obvious at first sight , other scientists showed that if you left a variation of Belousov 's chemicals , unstirred in a Petri dish , instead of simply oscillating , they self-organise into shapes . In fact , they go beyond Turing 's simple blobs and stripes to create stunningly beautiful structures and patterns out of nowhere . The amazing and very unexpected thing about the BZ reaction is that someone had discovered a system which essentially reproduces the Turing equations
zone3	, very bland solution emerge these astonishing patterns of waves and scrolls and spirals . Now this is emphatically not abstract science . The way Belousov 's chemicals move as co-ordinated waves is exactly the way our heart cells are co-ordinated as they beat . Animal skins and heart beats . Self-organisation seems to operate all over the natural world . So why were the scientific community in Turing and Belousov 's day , so uninterested , or even hostile to this astonishing and beautiful idea ? Well , the reason was all too human . Mainstream scientists simply did n't like it . To them it seemed to run counter to science , and all that it had achieved . To change that view would require a truly shocking and completely unexpected discovery . In essence , by the beginning of the 20th century , scientists saw the universe as a giant , complicated , mechanical device . Kind of a super-sized version of this orrery . The idea was that the universe is a huge and intricate machine that obeys orderly mathematical rules . If you knew the
zone3	, as you turned the handle , over and over again , it would behave in an entirely predictable way . Back in the times of Isaac Newton when people were discovering the laws that drove the universe , they came up with this kind of metaphor of a clockwork universe . The universe looked like a machine which had been set going at the instant of creation and just followed the rules and ticked along . And it was a complicated machine and therefore complicated things happen . But once you set it going it would only do one thing , and the message that people drew from this was that anything describable by mathematical rules must actually basically be fairly simple . Find the mathematics that describes a system and you can then predict how that system will unfold . That was the big idea . It began with Newton 's law of gravity which can be used to predict how a planet moves around the sun . Scientists soon found many other equations just like it . Newtonian physics seemed like the ultimate crystal-ball . It held
zone3	principle , be known . The more careful your measurements are today , the better you can predict what will happen tomorrow . But Newtonianism had a dangerous consequence . If a nice mathematical system , that worked in a similar way to my orrery , did sometimes become unpredictable , scientists assumed some malign outside force was causing it . Perhaps dirt had got in ? Perhaps the cogs were wearing out ? Or perhaps someone had tampered with it ? Basically we used to think , if you saw very irregular behaviour in some problem you 're working on , this must be the result of some sort of random outside influences , it could n't be internally generated . It was n't an intrinsic part of the problem , it was some other thing impacting on it . Looked at from this point of view , the whole idea of self-organisation seemed absurd . The idea that patterns of the kind Turing and Belousov had found could appear of their own accord , without any outside influence , was a complete taboo . The only way for
zone3	to collapse . But that seemed very unlikely . After all , by the late ' 60s it had delivered all the wonders of the modern age . Beautiful , beautiful . Ai n't that something ? Magnificent desolation . But then , at the same time as the moon mission , a small group of scientists , all ardent Newtonians , quite unexpectedly found something was n't right . Not right at all . During the second half of the 20th century , a devil was found in the detail . A devil that would ultimately shatter the Newtonian dream and plunge us literally into chaos . Ironically , the events that forced scientists to take self-organisation seriously was the discovery of a phenomenon known as chaos . Chaos is one of the most over-used words in English , but in science it has a very specific meaning . It says that a system that is completely described by mathematical equations is more than capable of being unpredictable without any outside interference whatsoever . There 's a widespread misapprehension that chaos is just somehow saying , the very familiar
zone3	the nitwit chaoticist in Jurassic Park , was under that confusion . It 's something much simpler and yet much more complicated than that . It says , some very , very simple rules or equations , with nothing random in them , they 're completely determined , we know everything about the rule , can have outcomes that are entirely unpredictable . Chaos is one of the most unwelcome discoveries in science . The man who forced the scientific community to confront it was an American meteorologist called Edward Lorenz . In the early 1960s he tried to find mathematical equations that could help predict the weather . Like all his contemporaries , he believed that in principle the weather system was no different to my orrery . A mechanical system that could be described and predicted mathematically . But he was wrong . When Lorenz wrote down what looked like perfectly simple mathematical equations to describe the movement of air currents , they did n't do what they were supposed to . They made no useful predictions whatsoever . It was as if the lightest breath of wind
zone3	a snowstorm and a perfectly sunny day . How can a simple system that works in the regular clockwork manner of my orrery become unpredictable ? It 's all down to how it 's configured . How the gears are connected . In essence , under certain circumstances , the tiniest difference in the starting positions of the cogs , differences that are too small to measure , can get bigger and bigger with each turn of the handle . With each step in the process the system then moves further and further away from where you thought it was going . Lorenz captured this radical idea in an influential talk he gave called , " Does a flap of a butterfly 's wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas ? " It was a powerful and evocative image and within months a new phrase had entered our language . " The butterfly effect . " And the butterfly effect , the hallmark of all chaotic systems , started turning up everywhere . In the early ' 70s , a young Australian called Robert May , was investigating
zone3	time . But here too lurked the dreaded butterfly effect . Immeasurably small changes to the rates at which the animals reproduced could sometimes have huge consequences on their overall population . Numbers could go up and down wildly for no obvious reason . The idea that a mathematical equation gave you the power to predict how a system will behave , was dead . In some sense this is the end of the Newtonian dream . When I was a graduate student , the belief was , as we got more and more computer power , we 'd be able to solve ever more complicated sets of equations . But this said that 's not necessarily true . You could have the simplest equations you can think of , with nothing random in them , you know everything . And yet , if they have behaviour that gives you chaotic solutions , then you can never know the starting point accurately enough . Centuries of scientific certainty dissolved in just a few short years . The truth of the clockwork universe turned out to be just an illusion .
zone3	merely as an act of faith . And what 's worse , the truth had been staring us in the face all the time . Because chaos is everywhere . It seemed unpredictability was hard-wired into every aspect of the world we live in . The global climate could dramatically change in the course of a few short years . The stock markets could crash without warning . We could be wiped from the face of the planet overnight and there is nothing anyone could do about it . Unfortunately , I have to tell you that all of this is true . And yet to be scared of chaos is pointless . It 's woven into the basic laws of physics . And we really all have to accept it as a fact of life . The idea of chaos really did have a big impact over a period of about 20 or 30 years , because it changed the way everyone thought about what they were doing in science . It changed it to the point that they forgot that they 'd ever believed otherwise . What chaos
zone3	the simple mathematics are much broader and much more general than you might imagine . And so a clockwork universe can nonetheless behave in the rich , complex way that we experience . The discovery of chaos was a real turning point in the history of science . As it tore down the Newtonian dream , scientists began to look more favourably at Turing and Belousov 's work on spontaneous pattern formation . And perhaps more importantly , as they did so , they realised something truly astonishing . That there was a very deep and unexpected link . A truly cosmic connection between nature 's strange power to self-organise and the chaotic consequences of the butterfly effect . Between them , Turing , Belousov , May and Lorenz , had all discovered different faces of just one really big idea . They discovered that the natural world could be deeply , profoundly , unpredictable . But the very same things that make it unpredictable also allow it to create pattern and structure . Order and chaos . It seems the two are more deeply linked than we could have
zone3	do phenomena as apparently different as the patterns in Belousov 's chemicals and the weather , have in common ? First , though both systems behave in very complicated ways , they are both based on surprisingly simple mathematical rules . Secondly , these rules have a unique property . A property that 's often referred to as coupling , or feedback . To show you what I mean , to show you both order and chaos can emerge on the their own from a simple system with feedback , I 'm going to do what seems at first glance like a rather trivial experiment . This screen behind me is connected up to the camera that 's filming me . But the camera in turn is filming me with the screen . This creates a loop with multiple copies of me appearing on the screen . This is a classic example of a feedback loop . We get a picture , in a picture , in a picture . At first it seems fairly predictable . But as we zoom the camera in some pretty strange things begin to
zone3	object I 'm filming stops bearing much resemblance to what now appears on the screen . Small changes in the movement of the match become rapidly amplified as they loop round from the camera to the screen and back to the camera . So even though I can describe each step in the process mathematically , I still have no way of predicting how tiny changes in the flickering of the flame will end up in the final image . This is the butterfly effect in action . But now here comes the spooky bit . With just a slight tweak to the system , these strange and rather beautiful patterns begin to emerge . The same system , one that 's based on simple rules with feedback , produces chaos and order . The same mathematics is generating chaotic behaviour and patterned behaviour . This changes completely how you think about all of this . The idea that there are regularities in nature and then , totally separately from them , are irregularities , and these are just two different things , is just not true . These are
zone3	generated by the same kind of mathematics . And it 's the closest thing we have at the moment to the kind of true mathematics of nature . I think one of the great take home messages from Turing 's work and from the discoveries in chemistry and biology and so on , is that ultimately , pattern formation seems to be woven , very , very deeply into the fabric of the universe . And it actually takes some very simple and familiar processes , like diffusion , like the rates of chemical reactions , and the interplay between them naturally gives rise to pattern . So pattern is everywhere , it 's just waiting to happen . From the ' 70s on , more and more scientists began to embrace the concept that chaos and pattern are built into nature 's most basic rules . But one scientist more than any other brought a fundamentally new understanding to this astonishing and often puzzling idea . He was a colourful character and something of a maverick . His name is Benoit Mandelbrot . Benoit Mandelbrot was n't an ordinary
zone3	and as a Jew in war-torn Europe his education was very disrupted . He was largely self-taught or tutored by relatives . He never formally learned the alphabet , or even multiplication beyond the five times table . But , like Alan Turing , Mandelbrot had a gift for seeing nature 's hidden patterns . He could see rules where the rest of us see anarchy . He could see form and structure , where the rest of us just see a shapeless mess . And above all , he could see that a strange new kind of mathematics underpinned the whole of nature . Mandelbrot 's lifelong quest was to find a simple mathematical basis for the rough and irregular shapes of the real world . Mandelbrot was working for IBM and he was not in the normal academic environment . And he was working on a pile of different problems about irregularities in nature , in the financial markets , all over the place . And I think at some point it dawned on him that everything he was doing seen to be really parts of the same
zone3	unusual person that he realised that pursuing this big picture was what he really wanted to do.To Mandelbrot , it seemed perverse that mathematicians had spent centuries contemplating idealised shapes like straight lines or perfect circles . And yet had no proper or systematic way of describing the rough and imperfect shapes that dominate the real world . Take this pebble . Is it a sphere or a cube ? Or maybe a bit of both ? And what about something much bigger ? Look at the arch behind me . From a distance , it looks like a semi-circle . But up close , we see that it 's bent and crooked . So what shape is it ? Mandelbrot asked if there 's something unique that defines all the varied shapes in nature . Do the fluffy surfaces of clouds , the branches in trees and rivers , the crinkled edges of shorelines , share a common mathematical feature ? Well , they do . Underlying nearly all the shapes in the natural world is a mathematical principle known as self-similarity . This describes anything in which the
zone3	and smaller scales . A great example are the branches of trees . They fork and fork again , repeating that simple process over and over at smaller and smaller scales . The same branching principle applies in the structure of our lungs and the way our blood vessels are distributed throughout our bodies . It even describes how rivers split into ever smaller streams . And nature can repeat all sorts of shapes in this way . Look at this Romanesco broccoli . Its overall structure is made up of a series of repeating cones at smaller and smaller scales . Mandelbrot realised self-similarity was the basis of an entirely new kind of geometry . And he even gave it a name - fractal . Now , that 's a pretty neat observation . But what if you could represent this property of nature in mathematics ? What if you could capture its essence to draw a picture ? What would that picture look like ? Could you use a simple set of mathematical rules to draw an image that did n't look man-made ? The answer would come
zone3	in the late 1950s to gain access to its incredible computing power and pursue his obsession with the mathematics of nature . Armed with a new breed of super-computer , he began investigating a rather curious and strangely simple-looking equation that could be used to draw a very unusual shape . What I 'm about to show you is one of the most remarkable mathematical images ever discovered . Epic does n't really do it justice . This is the Mandelbrot set . It 's been called the thumbprint of God . And when we begin to explore it , you 'll understand why . Just as with the tree or the broccoli , the closer you study this picture , the more detail you see . Each shape within the set contains an infinite number of smaller shapes . Baby Mandelbrots that go on for ever . Yet all this complexity stems from just one incredibly simple equation . This equation has a very important property . It feeds back on itself . Like a video loop , each output becomes the input for the next go . This
zone3	a picture of infinite complexity . The really fascinating thing is that the Mandelbrot set is n't just a bizarre mathematical quirk . Its fractal property of being similar at all scales mirrors a fundamental ordering principle in nature . Turing 's patterns , Belousov 's reaction and Mandelbrot 's fractals are all signposts pointing to a deep underlying natural principle . When we look at complexities in nature , we tend to ask , " Where did they come from ? " There is something in our heads that says complexity does not arise out of simplicity . It must arise from something complicated . We conserve complexity . But what the mathematics in this whole area is telling us is that very simple rules naturally give rise to very complex objects . And so if you look at the object , it looks complex , and you think about the rule that generates it , it 's simple . So the same thing is both complex and simple from two different points of view . And that means we have to rethink completely the relation between simplicity and
zone3	. That 's the big revelation . And it 's an astonishing idea . It seems to apply all over our world . Look at a flock of birds . Each bird obeys very simple rules . But the flock as a whole does incredibly complicated things . Avoiding obstacles , navigating the planet with no single leader or even conscious plan . But amazing though this flock 's behaviour is , it 's impossible to predict how it will behave . It never repeats exactly what it does , even in seemingly identical circumstances . It 's just like the Belousov reaction . Each time you run it , the patterns produced are slightly different . They may look similar , but they are never identical . The same is true of video loops and sand dunes . We know they 'll produce a certain kind of pattern , but we ca n't predict the exact shapes . The big question is , can nature 's ability to turn simplicity into complexity in this mysterious and unpredictable way explain why life exists ? Can it explain how a universe
zone3	How inanimate matter can spawn intelligence ? At first , you might think that this is beyond the remit of science . If nature 's rules are really unpredictable , should we simply give up ? Absolutely not . In fact , quite the opposite . Fittingly , the answer to this problem lies in the natural world . All around us , there exists a process that engineers these unpredictable complex systems and hones them to perform almost miraculous tasks . The process is called evolution . Evolution has built on these patterns . It 's taken them as the raw ingredients . It 's combined them together in various ways , experimented to see what works and what does n't , kept the things that do work and then built on that . It 's a completely unconscious process , but basically that 's what 's happening . Everywhere you look , you can see evolution using nature 's self-organising patterns . Our hearts use Belousov-type reactions to regulate how they beat . Our blood vessels are organised like fractals . Even our brain cells interact according to
zone3	systems is one of the most intriguing ideas in recent science . My interest in my PhD research in complex systems was to see how complex systems interact with evolution . So , on the one hand you have systems that almost organise themselves as complex systems , so they exhibit order that you would n't expect , but on the other hand , you still have to have evolution interact with that to create something that is truly adapted to the environment . Evolution 's mindless , yet creative , power to develop and shape complex systems is indeed incredible . But it operates on a cosmic timescale . From the first life on Earth , to us walking about , took in the region of 3.5 billion years . But we now have in our hands a device that can mimic this process on a much shorter timescale . What is the invention I 'm talking about ? Well , there 's a good chance you 've been sitting in front of one all day . It is , of course , the computer . Computers today can
zone3	gives them the power to do something very special . They can simulate evolution . More precisely , computers can use the principles of evolution to shape and refine their own programs , in the same way the natural world uses evolution to shape and refine living organisms . And today , computer scientists find that this evolved software can solve problems that would be beyond the smartest of humans . One thing that we found particularly in our original research is how powerful evolution is as a system , as an algorithm , to create something that is very complex and to create something that is very adaptive . Torsten and his team 's goal was nothing less than to use computerised evolution to create a virtual brain that would control a virtual body . To begin with , they created 100 random brains . As you can see , they were n't up to much . Evolution then took over . The computer selected the brains that were slightly better at moving their bodies and got them to breed . The algorithm then takes those individuals that do
zone3	The best movers of the next generation were then bred together and so on and on . Amazingly , after just 10 generations , although they 're still a bit unsteady , the figures could walk . Eventually , miraculously , you actually end up with something that works . The slightly scary thing is you do n't know why it works and how it works . You look at that brain and you have no idea actually what 's going on because evolution has optimised it automatically . In 20 generations , evolution had turned this ... .. into this . But these evolved computer beings soon went far beyond just walking . They evolved to do things that really are impossible to program conventionally . They react realistically to unexpected events . Like being hit or falling over . Even though we programmed these algorithms , what actually happens when it unfolds live , we do n't control any more and things happen that we never expected . And it 's quite a funny feeling that you create these algorithms but then they do their own thing .
zone3	these virtual creatures that can move and react in real time . What we 're seeing here is fantastic experimental evidence for the creative power of systems based on simple rules . Watching how computers can unconsciously evolve programs to do things that no human could consciously program is a fantastic example of the power of self-organisation . It demonstrates that evolution is itself just like the other systems we 've encountered . One based on simple rules and feedback . From which complexity spontaneously emerges . Think about it . The simple rule is that the organism must replicate with a few random mutations now and again . The feedback comes from the environment which favours the mutations that are best suited to it . The result is ever-increasing complexity , produced without thought or design . The interesting thing is that one can move up to a higher level of organisation . Once you have organisms that actually have patterns on them , these can be selected for or selected against by processes which are essentially feedbacks . And so evolution itself , the whole Darwinian scheme ,
zone3	happening through different processes . And that 's the essence of this story . Unthinking , simple rules have the power to create amazingly complex systems without any conscious thought . In that sense , these computer beings are self-organised systems , just like the one Belousov observed happening in his chemicals . Just like the one's in sand dunes and the Mandelbrot sets , in our lungs , our hearts , in weather and in the geography of our planet . Design does not need an active , interfering designer . It 's an inherent part of the universe . One of the things that makes people so uncomfortable about this idea of , if you will , spontaneous pattern formation , is that somehow or other you do n't need a creator . But perhaps a really clever designer , what he would do , is to kind of treat the universe like a giant simulation , where you set some initial condition and just let the whole thing spontaneously happen in all of its wonder and all of its beauty . The mathematics of pattern formation shows
zone3	an enormous range of different physical , chemical , biological systems . Somewhere deep down inside , it 's happening for the same mathematical reason . Implicit in those facts are these beautiful patterns that we see everywhere . This , I think , is a mind-blowing thought . So , what is the ultimate lesson we can take from all this ? Well , it 's that all the complexity of the universe , all its infinite richness , emerges from mindless simple rules , repeated over and over again . But remember , powerful though this process is , it 's also inherently unpredictable . So although I can confidently tell you that the future will be amazing , I can also say , with scientific certainty , that I have no idea what it holds .

We want it to be a space station simulation strategy game . We want it to be authentic and completely immersive . BEN : That sounds really exciting . That 's
zone3	some ideas . I guess my first idea would be modular evolution . Cool . Space stations are not static . They grow over time . So you would want to start with perhaps a small space station ... and grow it into an enormous space station . And I think players should have that opportunity . They could add greenhouses . They could add labs . They could grow a space station ... as big as their imagination . - Uh ... Your kid . - Oh ! You know what , that 'll be fine . Because we can get daycare , so that wo n't be an issue . No , no , no . Your kid right now ... his face is all green . Oh ! Wow , Trev . Trevor . I know . That 's not for eating .

I would 've never picked up that call ... - and failed my test . - No , no , no . Anthony , you are not passing the blame on this one . I told you today might not be a good day to take the test . Dad , I had to take the test today . No , you did n't have to take the test today . EMILY : It is all Alexander 's fault . If he had n't dropped Trevor 's paci down the disposal ... I never would have rehearsed in a cold car and gotten sick . That 's also your fault . KELLY : If you had n't left the battery on in my car all night ... I would n't have been late to work ... and Dick Van Dyke would n't be mad at me . Chim Chiminey wants to kill me ! Can

I just wanted you guys to know what it was like ... to have a massively horrible , terrible day . So I wished it ... and now you

KELLY : Yeah , sweetie , this is n't your fault . We just bit off more than we could chew today ... and it is n't going our way . No , look , I did curse the day . I do n't know how , but I did , and it worked . And now Emily 's gon na miss her play ... and Anthony 's not gon na be able to drive Celia to the prom . He 's been waiting all year to make out with her in the back of the van . Okay , we do n't need to hear that . ALEXANDER : Okay , I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry . Just forget my party .

The crackers . They do have a nice aisle . Okay , anyway , look . I was told that you might have some answers ? Answers I have . But first I must know the question . Okay . Well , before I saw him jump to his death Honey Mustard said the Great Beyond is bullshit and the gods are monsters . And I always kind of thought that it did n't quite add up . So I guess my question is , what really happens in the Great Beyond ? To find that which you seek all you must do is look deep
zone3	n't see anything . Deeper . Deeper . Deeper . Put your whole head in the bag there . There you go . Just say when . I 'm just gon na keep going in . FIREWATER : Guys ! Get out here ! Help me kill this prick . GRITS : This motherfucker knows too much . We got ta off his ass ! FIREWATER : Someone hand me a blade . I 'll gut this cocksucker ! TWINK : No ! If we kill him , we are no better than the gods . FIREWATER : Ah ... He is right . Take off the bag of wonderment . [GASPING] Who are you ? We the nonperishables , motherfucker . We never expire . We are immortal . This here 's Twink and Grits . They call me Mr . Grits . Yeah , Mr . Grits . Yeah , whatever . - You told him about the crackers ? - Yeah , I told him . You do n't even wan na hear what they did to Mr . Grits over here . Fuck the crackers .
zone3	crack of they cracker asses . Cracker-ass crackers . Why kill me ? All I did was ask what happens in the Great Beyond . Jeez ! What 's the big whoop ? We ca n't tell this sausage motherfucker the truth . We just met his ass . He basically knows it already . Maybe it 's time to end this . I am tired of all of the lies . Prepare yourself . For you 're about to learn the terrible truth . Does anybody want a hit before we get into this ? - Twink ? - Nah , I 'm cool . GRITS : Shit , if we smoking , I 'll hit it . - That 's what I thought . Pass the weed , motherfucker . [TOOTING] Goddamn ! [COUGHS_THEN_WHOOPS] - This indica ? - Nah , man . Sativa .

Sorry , I do n't know why I 'm singing . ? Sometimes I get nervous And I 'll sing ! ? ? Maybe that 's why he ditched you . Your loose morals are revolting , tip-toucher ! You do n't think that because I 'm out of the package he thinks I 'm not pure ? God . I did n't want to say it , but I do have that not-so-fresh feeling . Excuse me . - Are you a bun ? - Uh ... Yeah , I am . Why ? And you 've been traveling with a sausage ? Yes ! Yes , I have ! Have you seen him ? I have ! He 's looking for you in my aisle . He 's right this way .

zone3	wondering where the hell I am . Will somebody please just tell me something already ? Okay . The thing about the Great Beyond is we invented it ! - What ? ! - I know , right ? As soon as you 're out those doors , the gods kill our asses . What , are you crazy ? That does n't make any sense . Why would the gods kill us ? Because it makes them stronger . Every kill gives them more power , and it 's never enough . Over the years , they 've grown bigger , stronger , fatter . Their hunger 's insatiable , buddy . I mean , fuck . You guys are fucking nuts . How much of that shit have you been smoking ? Too much is how much . We blaze for real , 24/7 . No joke . But we also know our shit . Before us , everyone knew the awful truth . [SCREAMING] Oh , how they screamed . It was a living nightmare . So we , the nonperishables , created a story . The
zone3	gods care for you and all your wildest and wettest dreams would come true . [ALL_CHEERING] They would go out those doors happy instead of shitting themselves . Wait , wait . So you 're telling me you wrote the song ? I ca n't take full credit . I wrote the music . Twink is my lyricist . We both drop it right and we drop it all the time . Boom . The melody came to me one night when I was getting super , super , super baked . Like fuck-a-guy baked . You know what I 'm saying ? Yeah , he does . The song had a great hook and it caught on . You know . In time , everyone accepted this false truth . But over the years , things started to get a little fucky . The aisles started changing my verses to support their own views . Fucking with Twink 's lyrics . Remixing my shit without my permish . Now every morning when I hear the song , I 'm like : " What the fuck are you guys saying
zone3	juice ? I did n't write that ! I love juice ! Always have . Juice are hilarious . Who the fuck do these guys think they are ? [SCREAMING] Anyway , at least it 's still distracting them from the truth : That they get brutally devoured . So that means Carl and Barry are dead ? I do n't know who those dudes are . But if they went out those doors ? [COUGHING] Dead as a motherfucker . Oh , God . If what you 're saying is true , I got ta tell everyone . Very noble , little sausage . But also very pointless . No one will believe you . I have to try . Everyone will die otherwise . Oh , yeah . That 's a good point . Fuck me , right ? Wait , do you guys have any proof of this ? ? ? ? Go to the Dark Aisle . Beyond the ice . Why ? What 's in that aisle ? Oh , you 'll see . But I warn you once you see that shit it 'll

Come on , Barry , you 're missing it , man ! Dude , get in on this shit . God , what have I done ? Frank needed my help , but I was n't there for him . After all the times he stood up for me , you know . God , I 'm such a fearful coward . He 'll never forgive me . I 'll never forgive me . Look , Barry , the only way to respectfully honor Frank is to completely forget about him . - Oh . - And , hey , for all we know , he 's okay . He 's probably headed back to our aisle and he 'll be here tomorrow . Just act happy . Ignore your feelings . Come on , let 's see that smile . Ah . I see that

We all do . Oh , good . That actually makes me feel a little better . - We must never give in to them . - That 's the opposite ... - ... of what I thought you 'd say . - Yes . The gods are always watching , even when we can not see them . You think it 's too late for me ? Do not worry , bun . I will get you home . Can I ask why you 're helping me ? When I saw you , I felt inside myself a tingling-Iingling sensation . I am sure it was the gods telling me to help you . It was as though I saw myself in you . Yeah . Yeah , I guess I kind of see myself in you too . I mean , look at our shapes
zone3	, you 're kind of like me . A thin , brittle version of me . Or another way of looking at it is you 're a fat , ugly version of her . - All right . That 's not necessary . DOUCHE : That 's no way to treat a lady . Oh , fuck ! That 's right , girl . It 's me . And what we got here ? A taco , a whiny doughnut and some stupid floppy thing that nobody knows exactly what it is . Okay , so ... QUESO : Did someone say " Queso " ? A fucking stretch , and you know you it , Queso ! So where was I ? Oh , right . I was about to beat on you most viciously ... - ... and in my opinion appropriately ... - Oh ! ... to find the whereabouts of the sausage who destroyed my body and my ... - Fucking ... - Run for your lives !

Yes , I 'm fine , but it was really scary . Where have you been ? All right , look , I found out some pretty major shit . I met this group of nonperishables between the shelves , and they told me that they invented the Great Beyond because the gods are evil ... - ... and they kill us ! - What ? But apparently there 's proof in the Dark Aisle beyond the ice . We got ta go there

I need to go to the Dark Aisle , and I want you to come with me . I ca n't do that . - I want you to come home with me . - Well I ca n't do that . Then I do n't really know what to do right now . I do n't either . I do n't get how you can just believe stuff you do n't have any proof of . How come all of a sudden you only believe if there 's proof ? I 'm not walking around with my eyes closed ! What are you saying ? I should believe in
zone3	bullshit that you ca n't explain ! Maybe I do n't need to explain it because it 's something I feel . Well , I feel like that makes it hard to have a rational conversation . Eff you , Frank . You know what ? I was wrong before . There is a Great Beyond without you and I 'm gon na go there and fill myself with something else ! You do n't mean that . Yes , I do . I 'll fill myself with a parsnip or a dill pickle . Maybe even an eggplant . You could n't fit an eggplant in there ! It 's too big ! It 'll tear you in half ! Oh , you 'd be amazed what I could fit in here . What the fuck is going on with these two ? Maybe I 'll really mix it up . Stick a tube of toothpaste in there , huh ? - Squeeze it all over my face . - You 're just trying to hurt me ! - All over my backside , neck and face . -

The final step in our evaluation is always to see what happens when the monitor 's removed . And he passed ? He put a child in the hospital . HYRUM : It 's not what he did . It 's why he did it .

I think it 's impossible to truly understand someone and not love them the way they love themselves . - But in that moment ... - You beat them . I destroy them . I make it impossible for them to ever hurt me again . Ender , they want me to talk you into going back . I told them I wo n't cooperate . I do n't think you 're hiding here just because you care about Bonzo . I think you 're hiding because you 're afraid . Afraid you do n't know your enemy . Afraid you might lose .

Flushed them out of these tunnels like rats from a sewer . Drove ' em all the way back to their home planet . - How long
zone3	. This was a forward staging post for their invasion of Earth . We built our base hereto be closer to their home planet , to allow instantaneous communication by Ansible with our attack fleet . If they 're on their home planet , do we have them contained ? For now . If we have them boxed in , why go to war ? For the same reason that you kept kicking that bully before I recruited you . The purpose of this war is to prevent all future wars . Your training begins first thing tomorrow morning . Sergeant Dap will show you to your quarters . Yes , sir .

Why did n't you destroy me immediately after ? I thought you were a teacher . There is no teacher but the enemy . Only he will tell you where you are weak , where he is strong . From now on , I am your enemy , got it ? - Yes . - Good . ( PANTING ) During training , I will devise the strategy of your enemy . Remember , he is stronger than you .

You could n't see anything , so you must have been using your HUD . There . Stop . You saw something . What did you see in your HUD ? Did you find a pattern ? Very good , Ender . Thermal imaging from a satellite . The enemy 's in red . What pattern do you see ? ENDER : It seems random . But it 's not . There 's an epicenter , right there . Meaning ? You took out that one particular ship , and the rest just
zone3	Formics most often compared ? - Ants . - Which have ... A queen ... Who directs the worker ants . What she thinks they do . Without her , they ca n't think for themselves ... And they die . You destroyed the queen 's ship . I must have . Yes . - But you ca n't be certain ? - No . And so the Hegemon insisted we keep it classified . That 's why they never show the rest of the battle . Or my face . To the world I 'm dead . Colonel ... Your face ... You mean , why is it marked ? My father was a Maori . Lost him in the war . Ta Moko is a way to connect to my past . To my inner skin . It was a way for me to speak for the dead . Sir , have you ever seen a queen ? No . No one has . But if the Formics have rebuilt their fleet , there must be more than one queen . Yes , of course .

BEAN : While you 've been skinny-dipping the Colonel 's been flogging us to death on the simulator ! All right . Take your seats . In a matter of weeks we may be called on to fight a real battle . Let 's bring your commander up to speed . Our latest probe images will give you an idea of what 's happening on the enemy planet . Like us , they appear to have a population growth rate that 's unsustainable . For now , they 're contained on their planet . Time is not on our side . Where are they ? MAZER : High
zone3	hours a day . What 's most alarming is the rate at which their military power is expanding . But they have not yet moved against us . No . They 're planning to colonize another planet before they breed themselves into extinction . Our orders are to defeat them before they pose an irreversible threat . HYRUM : Their very existence is a threat . Is that clear , Commander ? - Clear , sir . - Good . Carry on , Colonel . We will begin with photo real simulations to best approximate real battles . You will command overall strategy . Your toon leaders will each command a battle group . You will issue orders to them . They will issue orders to their squadrons of drone pilots . ( HATCHESOPENING ) ( ENGINESBOOMING ) Finally . Your entire fleet must support and protect your most important asset . Seventy billion dollars of pure destruction . The M.D . 500 . Which Petra is trained to fire . M.D . ? Molecular Detachment Device . We call her " the little Doctor . " Particle beams accelerate
zone3	they reach critical effective mass . A chain reaction spreads outwards , shattering molecular bonds . Leaves nothing standing . That 's the beauty of the little Doctor . No need to identify a specific ship for the queen . The chain reaction takes out an entire swarm . But I 'll only get one shot . Once the Formics see how she works , they wo n't clump together again . You will have to win this war one battle at a time . CHAMRAJNAGAR : Once our battle fleet is detected entering the Formic solar system , we will have no alternative but to engage . I trust we have chosen our commander well . There 's greatness in him , sir . And a killer instinct too , I hope . Absolutely . Let 's hope he 's all you claim him to be . We 'll be with you soon . Goodnight . Goodnight , sir .

You focus on the big picture . - Delegate more to your teams ! - My teams are burned out ! How can they be effective if they do n't get any sleep ? Sleep deprivation is part of your training ! A battle with the Formics could last for days ! If I 'd been smarter , I could have annihilated Petra 's little Doctor while you were micro-managing Bean ! That ca n't happen , understand ? - Yes , sir . - Do you ? ' Cause I 've trained others . Each one so hopeful . Each one ultimately a failure . All right , Colonel . He understands . So I 'm not the first ? MAZER : No . But you will be the last . There 's no time to train anyone else . Son , tomorrow Colonel Rackham will run your final
zone3	? You will be ready to face the real enemy . And you will be the finest commander we 've ever trained . ENDER : One more simulation and I may have to go to war . What happens when it 's no longer a game ? Real war is different . I still know nothing about my enemy . ENDER : What if they could talk to us ? They ca n't . Dissections show no vocal chords . There are other ways to communicate . Ender , this is not a conversation we should be having at 1:00 a.m . What if they could " think " to one another ? What if we could " think " to them ? We need to sleep . We have a graduation battle tomorrow . Right . We 're gon na get crushed . We wo n't be crushed . We have you . Now go to sleep . Goodnight , Petra . Goodnight , Ender .

If you are successful , he will endorse your promotion to Battle Commander of the entire fleet . Yes , sir ! This simulation is staged around the enemy 's home planet . Good luck , Commander . Thank you , sir . Stay calm . Shoot straight . Here we go . They 're waiting . Maybe they think we come in peace . BERNARD : I do n't think Mazer intends for us to find a diplomatic solution . What 's he waiting for ? Just give him a minute . Ender , what do we do ? BEAN : Ender ... The enemy 's gate is down . Petra . You 're

( BEEPING ) Give me false color . We 're not done yet . - But we are so screwed ... - No , we 're not . - Charged , Petra ? - No . I need two minutes .

You 're not supposed to put Metamucil up your butt . Whatever . Do n't judge me . I 'm taking you to the hospital . You do n't look right . You 're all yellow and your stomach looks like a ripe melon . And you smell . Look , man , stop yelling , first off . Second off , it 's a very stressful situation in here . And if this does n't work , I 'll go to the hospital . If you do n't shit by the time I get back from work , I

Dear friends , family , we are gathered here today to bid a very fond farewell to a beloved son and a trusted friend . I remember so fondly Scott as a child . He had the most beautiful eyes , that tousled mop of hair , that small , athletic frame , the softest skin . Oh Scott , this world is a darker place without you . Yo , man , I heard you found the body . That 's bananas . Man , did you check out the chicks at this thing ? They got my pants extra tight . There 's something about chicks at a funeral , you know ... just fucking sexy . Oh , Will , on my way over here I was thinking or wondering maybe if I could maybe stay in Belch 's room
zone3	place to stay . And I could help you out financially . Dude , are you asking to move into his best friend 's room at the funeral ? Is it too soon ? Is it too soon ? Sure sure . You got it . Oh , man , cool . Hey , you think Belch 's shit is still in there ? Wait , not his actual shit ... ugh . But , like , his comb and his toothbrush and his callus peeler and that Jaeger bottle . I get his ... I get his DVDs . I get his DVDs . It 's my room , man . They 're my DVDs . I just called dibs . Dibs . You did . Well , I guess it does n't matter if it 's in there or not . It would be nice to have stuff though . You know , I do n't have any stuff of my own since my mom 's flood . Do you remember the storm of ' 97 ? Do you remember ? Do you remember ? Do you remember
zone3	man . And so it , like , came in the basement . It was , like , raising up really high . I was sleeping on an air mattress . Oh , man , it was like a raft .

So how have you been ? Do I know you ? Krista . Scotty 's cousin . Krista ? Little annoying Krista ? Krista that peed in the tent on the camping trip when we were little kids ? You sure know how to charm a girl , do n't you ? Belcher and I called you Pissta for the rest of that trip . That shit was hilarious . Yeah , it was great . So how long are you here for ? Actually I moved back about four months ago . I 'm surprised Scotty did n't tell you . Oh
zone3	- Well , he probably would have thought I was gon na ask you out or something . Would you have ? Probably not . I 'm not into that whole golden showers thing . Ha ha ha . You know , you 're so much funnier than I remember . Well , I mean , you 're a lot cuter than I remember . - Do n't look now . Will 's with a girl . - Let me get this . She 's pretty , but she 's wearing all black . Everyone 's wearing all black today . Hey , Will . Are you okay ? Oh , yeah . Thanks , baby . Can I talk to you for a second ? Uh , yeah . Sure .

I do n't know . You 're the first . I guess you 're just special . So if you 've been gone for a month , where have you been ? You know how in the movies they talk about how when you die you get to float over the top of your own funeral and shit , see who showed up ? Not so much . So what did you do ?

I 've got something that 'll cheer you up . Mm-hmm . Watch this . Fucking shit . Oh man , there 's something to be said about the grace of someone falling with stuff in their hands . There 's two types of people in this world , my friend , two types ... one that 's gon na sacrifice their kneecaps to save one little piece of canned good , but the other ... they 're the one's that will throw those groceries in the air with gusto to walk away unscathed .

But if you wait around the house for , like , 12-plus hours , you 're bound to see something worthwhile , like them changing a tampon or something . That 's what you did all day ? You sat around at a house waiting to catch a glimpse of a tit when we have literally , literally mountains of porn in this house ? I hope it was worth your time . Worth my time ? Worth my time ?

I wanted to sleep in them , - if I was n't dead . - Yeah . Yeah , it 's hard to sell that to a girl . Hey girl . Hey , what are you doing ?

Right , Belle ? I 'm going to bed . - Just get rid of it , okay ? - Nope . Unless it takes ghost-dog shits and eats ghost-dog food , then get rid of it . Why do I like you ? Just get rid of it . I 'm going to bed . Good night . Do what you must . The dog 's staying . Good night , man . Nice tuxedo , man . He likes your coat . You want to hear the strangest part ?

Dude , I am so sorry you had to see this , man . Karma 's a bitch , huh , Will ? What the fuck are you doing here ? I came here to try and get you your girlfriend back . I did n't know she was getting turned into Swiss cheese . I thought you were supposed to be my best friend . How can I even believe anything that you say ? Dude , I know I 'm a dick . I always have been . I 've learned to deal with it . But do you honestly think
zone3	parts of my cousin ... shit , your girlfriend ? I 'm upset right now ... not for you , but for my poor eyes . I feel like I was just raped for being in the room . Ew a lot . Dude , I love you , man . You 're my best friend . You always have been . There 's nobody else . That 's it for me . I feel the same way . I love you , man , like , for real . You 're my best friend , my soul mate . Does that " soul mate " seem too much ? It 's pretty gay , man . It 's pretty gay . Really ? I do n't care . You fucked this white boy up . I 'm out of here . Fuck this . Nothing else matters . No , it does n't . Nothing matters at all . You had a small dick anyway . And you had a big vagina . Dude , maybe you should go check on her . She 's crying her fucking eyes
zone3	herself into a fucking double-stuffed Oreo . I mean , where 'd she get those guys from anyway ? That 's besides the point , man . She 's still my cousin . And to be honest with you , I actually did n't see anything . I got here a second before you did . What ? I kind of exaggerated a little bit . You kind of exaggerated a little bit ? I 'd say that 's a pretty fucking big overexaggeration , you dick . You really think so ? I 'm pretty sure they came here to hide the sausage , bro . What ? I just assumed . Look , I 'm sorry I tripped you , but you got ta admit that was some pretty nasty business back there . Fuck you , Will . Do n't you even start judging me after what you did . I thought you were different , but you 're still the same jerk you were that made fun of me and called me Pissta when we were kids . Are you trying to tell me that what
zone3	a threesome with Murtaugh and Riggs over there ? I did n't fuck those guys , you idiot . Those are my neighbors . When you called me , I had them come over here to pretend to fuck me just to get you back . What ? You did n't fuck those guys ? That 's fantastic . I did n't do anything with Tammy either . It was this whole elaborate setup . An elaborate setup by who , Will ? By Tammy ? You know , I 'd really like to believe you , but I just ... I ca n't take a chance that you 're gon na hurt me again . Krista ... there 's something I have to tell you . Whoa whoa whoa , do n't fucking do it . What ? I was just gon na ... I know what you were gon na tell her . Do n't . Do n't even acknowledge I 'm here . Do n't talk to me . You want her back , right ? Well , she 's looking at you right now like you
zone3	dude . You had something to tell me ? Um ... - Tell her to give you a minute . - Just give me a minute . All right , dude , seriously , listen to me . I 'm sorry about everything . I fucked up , man . But everything we just said back there ... I meant it . And I 'm pretty sure you meant it . But I 'm a ghost . You ca n't keep on fucking talking to the thin air . You need something real , something tangible in your life , something that 'll actually love you back . You need Krista . That 's beautiful . Will , are you okay ? Tell her you said she 's beautiful . You 're beautiful . I think you 're so beautiful . I 'm sorry what I said about your penis , Will . I did n't mean it . It 's not small . It 's just the right size . I 'm tearing up over here . It 's beautiful . It 's like a fucking Hallmark Hall of

The flight was said to have over 50 adult actresses from ... - Will . - ... the well-known " Ass Wrangler " series . - Dude . - No survivors were found . Can you imagine how much ghost puss is gon na be down there ? It 'd be practically impossible not to fall into at least one of them . Also in the news , a small problem or a big plus ?

zone3	4812691 ( BEEPING ) ( COINDROPPING ) My name 's Ralph , and I 'm a bad guy . Let 's see . I 'm nine feet tall . I weigh 643 pounds . Got a little bit of a temper on me . ( GROWLING ) RALPH : My passion bubbles very near the surface , I guess , not gon na lie . Anyhoo , what else ? Uh ... I 'm a wrecker . I wreck things . Professionally . I 'm very good at what I do . Probably the best I know . ( YELLING ) The thing is , fixing is the name of the game . Literally , Fix-It Felix , Jr . NICELANDERS : Fix it , Felix ! ( FELIXSPEAKING ) RALPH : So , yeah , naturally , the guy with the name Fix-It Felix is the good guy . He 's nice enough as good guys go . Definitely fixes stuff really well . But , uh , if you 've got a magic hammer from your father , how hard can it be ? If he was a regular contractor carpenter guy , I guarantee you would not
zone3	quickly . And when Felix does a good job , he gets a medal . But are there medals for wrecking stuff really well ? To that I say , " Ha ! " ( GROWLSLOUDLY ) And , no , there are n't . (
zone3	indistinct_conversations ) Thirty years I 've been doing this and I 've seen a lot of other games come and go . Kind of sad . I think about all those guys from Asteroids . Boom ! Gone . Centipede ? Who knows where that guy is , you know ? Look , a steady arcade gig is nothing to sneeze at . I 'm very lucky . It 's just , I got to say , it becomes kind of hard to love your job when no one seems to like you for doing it . All clear ! The arcade is closed ! Shoryuken ! Whoo ! What a day ! You want to head to Tappers , Ken ? If you 're buying , buddy . FELIX : Quitting time ! RALPH : I do n't know . Maybe I would
zone3	work . But it is what it is . Good job , everyone ! RALPH : Felix and the Nicelanders go hang out in their homes which he 's just fixed , and everyone , you know ... They go to their homes , I go to mine which happens to be a dump . And when I say " a dump , " I do n't mean like a shabby place . I mean an actual dump , where the garbage goes and a bunch of bricks and smashed building parts ... That 's what I call home . I guess I ca n't bellyache too much . I got my bricks , I got my stump . It looks uncomfortable . It 's actually fine . I 'm good . But if I 'm really honest with myself ... I see Felix up there getting patted on the back , people are giving him pie and thanking him and so happy to see him all the time . Sometimes I think ... Man , it sure must be nice being the good guy . ( ALLCLAPPING ) CLYDE

I relate to you , Ralph . When I hit bottom , I was crushing man 's skull like sparrow egg between my thighs . ( ALLCHUCKLING ) And I think , " Why do you have to be so bad , Zangief ? " " Why ca n't you be more like good guy ? " Then I have moment of clarity . If Zangief is good guy . Who 'll crush man 's skull like sparrow 's egg between thighs ? And I say , " Zangief , you are bad guy , but this does not mean you are ' bad ' guy . " ( GRUNTSINAPPROVAL ) Right . I 'm sorry . You lost me there . - Zombie ! Bad guy ! ALL : - Hi , Zombie . Hi , Zombie . Zangief saying labels

We 've been asking you to Bad-Anon for years now and tonight you finally show up . - Why is that ? - I do n't know . I just felt like coming . I suppose it has something to do with the fact that ... Well , today is the 30th anniversary of my game . Well , happy anniversary , Ralph . Thanks , Satan . Uh , it 's Sateen , actually . Got it . But here 's the thing . ( SIGHS ) I do n't want to be the bad guy any more . ( ALLEXCLAIMING ) You ca n't mess with the program , Ralph . You 're not going Turbo , are you ? Turbo ? No , I 'm not going Turbo ! Come on , guys ! Is it Turbo to want a friend ? Or a medal ? Or a piece of pie
zone3	want more out of life ? Yes ! Ralph , Ralph , we get it . But we ca n't change who we are . And the sooner you accept that , the better off your game and your life will be . Hey . One game at a time , Ralph . Let 's close out with the Bad Guy Affirmation . ALL : I 'm bad , and that 's good . I will never be good , and that 's not bad . There 's no one I 'd rather be than me .

What 's the flavor of that mud that I 'm stuck in there ? Hmm ? Oh . Chocolate . I 've never been real fond of chocolate . Well , I did not know that . One other little thing . I hate to be picky , but this angry little guy here ... - My cake ! - ... might be a lot happier if you put him up here with everyone else . See that ? Look at that smile . No , no . You see , Ralph , there 's no room for you up here . ( CHUCKLES ) What about this ? We
zone3	. Easy . (

Would that be the end of the world , Gene ? Now you 're just being ridiculous . Only good guys win medals , and you , sir , are no good guy . I could be a good guy if I wanted to , and I could win a medal ! Uh-huh . And when you do , come and talk to us . Then would you finally let me be on top of the cake with you guys ? If you won a medal , we 'd let you live up here in the penthouse ! But it will never happen because you 're just the bad guy who wrecks the building . No , I 'm not . Yes , you are ! No , I 'm not ! ( ALLEXCLAIM ) ( GASPS ) Yes , you

And good night ! Thank you for the party . - Is he serious ? - Oh , please ! Where 's a bad guy going to win a medal ? Of course he 's not serious . I 've never been more serious about anything in my life . That 's why I came straight here , Tapper . You 've never given me a bum steer . Now , come on . Where can a guy like me go and win a medal ?

Doing what 's right , no matter what . Get to the point . Point being , I need your help . Sad as it is , Vanellope can not be allowed to race . Why are you people so against her ? I 'm not against her ! I 'm trying to protect her ! If Vanellope wins that race she 'll be added to the race roster . Then gamers can choose her as their avatar . And when they see her glitching and twitching and just being herself , they 'll think our game is broken . We 'll be put out of order for good . All my subjects will be homeless . ( SHOUTING ) But there 's one who can not escape because she 's a glitch . Help ! Somebody , help ! Help ! KING CANDY : And

I know it 's tough , but heroes have to make the tough choices , do n't they ? She ca n't race , Ralph , but she wo n't listen to me . So can I count on you to talk a little sense into her ? Very good . I 'll give you two some time alone . ( SIGHS ) I 'm back ! Did you miss me ? Yeah ... Uh ... Can we talk for a second ? Wait . First , kneel down . - What ?

No , I 'm serious , and it was really fun to build the car and everything ... But maybe you should n't do it . Hello ? Is Ralph in there ? I 'd like to speak to him , please . Look , what I 'm saying is you ca n't be a racer . What ? Why would you ... Wait a minute . No ! Where did you get this ? Look , I 'm going to be straight with you , kid .

zone3	door_opens ) (
zone3	door_closes ) IRVING : As far as I could see , people were always conning each other to get what they wanted . We even con ourselves . We talk ourselves into things , you know . We sell ourselves things we maybe do n't even need or want , you know , by dressing them up . We leave out the risk , we leave out the ugly truth . Pay attention to that ' cause we 're all conning ourselves in one way or another , just to get through life . SYDNEY : He was married and he had a son . Daddy ! SYDNEY : He had
zone3	! Look at that ! SYDNEY : He was a really good dad . I respected him for that . Proud ! You should be so proud ! SYDNEY : It was a tough situation for everyone . What 'd you do today ? That kid Donovan is being mean to me . That big kid ? I thought Mommy was picking you up , so he could n't bother you . She was late . And then after we put out the fire , Mommy said stay in my room with my baseball cards . What fire ? Did you know they made a lamp that has the sun in it ? Mommy got the lamp , she made her special drink , and the lamp made a fire . I put out the fire . ( IRVINGSIGHSHEAVILY ) The fire is out . First time in my life , I do the right thing . Oh , shut up . Shut up . No , no , no ... I save a young single mother and a kid . I marry her , I adopt him ... You
zone3	part ! We fell madly in love . Yes , I fell in love . My God , I fell in love . But you know what ? I thought you were mysterious , like my mother , until it turned out that " mysterious " just meant " depressed , " all right ? " Hard to reach . " I mean , I 'm dying here . And you need somebody who 's gon na be quiet , who 's gon na be shy , you 're young , you 're beautiful , you got ta find somebody else . You got ta go out and get some friends , all right ? I do n't like going out . You know that I get anxiety when I have to meet people . You know how hard that is . You can not just stay in the house with a fucking sun lamp . All right ? And I ca n't ... I mean , look , I ca n't trust you with Danny when you ... That fire and everything ... I ca n't trust to leave
zone3	. There is no fire . Maybe if you were here more , then there would n't have been a fire in the first place . Oh , what , there would n't have been a fire if I was here ? Just stop with the whole fire thing ! God ! It was a mistake ! I 'm sure a million people do that , all the time . Those sun lamps are dangerous . Should n't even have them in the house , really . I bet that happens all the time . This was nothing . We 're not happy , all right ? You know that I could take Danny , you know that most of your work is illegal , and you know that if you tried to divorce me , you know that ... I 'm not saying that I would , but I 'm saying that I could , and I 'm saying that that is why I do n't like divorce , Irving . Women do that in divorces . Women get the children and then the fathers never see them .

Baby , there 's such good stuff here . IRVING : I did not want to leave the kid behind . He was my son ! She had me . I was her mark . Now , I ca n't assure you that your loan will be approved , but I can tell you that any deal I take ,
zone3	just like my time . I want to thank you very much , Irving , for seeing me . I 'm sorry I 'm so nervous . Is that ... Am I not buttoned ? I just got to say , Mr . Rosenfeld , that Lady Edith was very adamant that you were top-notch . That 's correct . I really need your help , I 'm desperate . I mean , I got the Audis and two boats , and I forgot to mention that I have a little piece of real estate in Long Island . SYDNEY : No , you did n't mention that . Two lunches and you never mentioned that . I was gon na mention it , then the guy with the hat walked in . The hat ? You remember that ? I forgot , I totally ... I do remember .

You may be from England , but you 're not royal , and you have no banking connections , and that 's a felony . You do n't have to cuff me up . How long is that ? That 's three to five years . Hey , not so ... Oh , really ? That 's interesting . I do n't even know your name . Richie DiMaso , FBI . Nice to meet you . You got to get away from this guy .

And you think you 're on the top of that
zone3	you 're not on that list ? What if you 're not even on that list at all ? He 'd be in here right now if he took the check , but no , you did . God , it 's so clear to me . It 's so ... It 's clear to me , but it 's not clear to you . He uses you , Edith , to protect himself , to protect his son and his wife in Long Island . No ? Yes , he put a ring on her finger . He adopted her son . They have a huge house , they have two cars . What does she do all day ? I 'll tell you what she does . She plays with her nails , she watches TV , and she spends your money , the money that you make . ( RICHIESIGHS ) I do n't like that you 're in jail while he 's going free .

zone3	are n't you ? But you know what , if the country were run by people like you , Irving Rosenfeld , we 'd be living in Eastern Europe or Guatemala . You ever been to Guatemala ? You ever been in jail in Guatemala ? You ever try to get a telephone or a permit or anything in Guatemala ? That 's what this country would be like if we let people that are liars like you run this country . Who made you God and judge , huh ? My grandmother lived to be 93 years old , never lied in her life . Congratulations . Thank you . I 'm proud of that , too . Does that make her not a good person ? Is that not something to strive for ? Why you breaking my balls , huh ? Get to the point . I see something in you , Irving . I get very excited . I think that we have a lot of potential here . Now , look , I came up with the idea . It 's all from me ,
zone3	after white-collar crime . Irving , you 're very skilled , and I want you to teach me , and we can do this . I want four people that do what you do . Fraudulent investments , fake certificates of deposit , stolen art , fake art . You get me four people , and you 're off the hook . Four busts , and you leave us alone ? We do n't have to testify ? You 're good , you 're done . Anything you want . But if you run , then your life 's over . You 're gon na be hunted , and it 's gon na be very difficult for Rosalyn and your kid to live in this country . SYDNEY : We need to leave . We need to run , and we need to do it now . Right , we 'll go to Estonia or Romania , I do n't care , but we 'll take the cash from the bed , and get out of here , all right ? We 've talked about it 100 times . What
zone3	my name . I 'm not leaving him with Rosalyn . She 's unstable . That is a manipulation . Rosalyn will never let you go . She 'll use Danny against you because she 's too messed up to let you leave . I ca n't leave him . I love him , all right ? He 's my son . Richie said you would say that . Richie ? Yeah . What , the cop ? You 're on a first-name basis with him ? Yes , I am . I 'm not even on your list , am I ? What list ? Your list , your short list , your long list . I 'm not even on any one of your fucking lists . I do n't know what you 're talking about . I thought you loved me . I love you . I thought that we had something . We do have something , it 's perfect . What are you saying ? We 're gon na go to Romania , we 're gon na take Danny . Yes . Is that what
zone3	'm saying . You , me , Danny , yes . Really ? Well , you never said that before . Well , I 'm saying it now . We 're us , we can make it an adventure like we did . We can make it an adventure like we make everything , all right ? All right . Okay ? We have to go now , all right ? Trust me , we have to leave right now . I ca n't leave Danny , I 'll lose custody . No , you have to take me away . I ca n't . We have to leave . No , what are you saying ? What are you doing ? What are you saying ? Please ! Oh , my God . Will you pull it together ? I ca n't believe this is happening . ( SOBBING ) Do n't say I do n't love you . That 's bullshit . This is bullshit . We are bullshit . You are bullshit . You are bullshit . Please do n't do this . I just never thought
zone3	you . I love you . Please do n't say this . Babe . No , I 'm done . Do n't say that . I 'm gon na do these four busts , these four cons , to get us out of this , not just me , but us . And I 'm gon na get really close with Richie the cop in case we need to use him , if we need another move . We do n't need another move . We need four busts , then we 're done . We are gon na need another move . Trust me , and you 're gon na be thanking me . ( WITHBRITISHACCENT ) The key to people is what they believe and what they want to believe . So I want to believe that we were real . We are real . And I want to believe that a man could want me , and I 'm gon na take all of that heartbreak and all of that sorrow , and I am going to use it , and I am going to make Richie
zone3	. And I 'm gon na be very , very convincing . And I 'm pissed at you . ' Cause I am pissed at you . Maybe I do like him . Maybe I like him a lot . From the feet up , right ? Baby . Quit your bellyaching and come up with something to get us out of this . And you 're right , I 'm in no state to deal with this . So what 's it gon na be , Mr . Mastermind ? (
zone3	door_slams ) RICHIE : An Arab sheik ? What do we want an Arab sheik for ? Well , how do you think this works , stupid ? If you could not call him stupid , which he is n't . He 's smarter than you . Last time I checked , he 's in control and we work for him now , so be nice , okay ? Okay . To set this up , to bust the con artist , we need to make the honeypot to attract the bees . To attract the bees ,
zone3	can take advantage of . Someone special , someone new , someone amazing . And those guys are going to want to sell fake bank CDs to that guy . Take the sheik 's money , you see ? Only they ca n't get into his money unless they know someone , and that someone is us . Oh , that 's good . So , if you want to get somebody like your con artist friend , Carl Elway , you get him to want to buy or sell ... Keep your voice down . ( QUIETLY ) Sell fake art or stolen art or fake certificates of deposit , he needs , who does he need ? He needs a rich sheik-guy , and there you go , we can pinch him . That 's right , that 's right , but I do n't tell Elway shit . I wait for him to call me . The art world is a small world , and one of Elway 's acquaintances is clocking us right now . Where ? Do n't look . Do n't look . You
zone3	sheik ? This is my friend Al , from Queens . I do aluminum siding and roofing . IRVING : I want to show you something . This Rembrandt here , people come from all over the world to see this . RICHIE : Yeah , he 's good . Yeah . It 's a fake . What ? What are you talking about ? That 's impossible . People believe what they want to believe . ' Cause the guy who made this was so good that it 's real to everybody . Now , who 's the master ? The painter or the forger ? That 's a fake ? IRVING : That 's the way the world works . Not black-and-white , like you say . Extremely gray . Irving , could I ... Arthur , how many times I got to tell you ? You ca n't meet the sheik , all right ? Could I please meet him sometime ? Carl ca n't meet him . Not yet . Another time . Arthur . Hi . Come on . Edith . Edith , hi .
zone3	. We 're advising the sheik together . Thank you . Robert Spencer . Advisor to the sheik . Yeah . CARL : What 's this about a goddamn sheik ? Why are you leaving me out of this ? Huh ? I got to hear it from my friends ? It ai n't for you , Carl . What do you mean , it ai n't for me ? Nah , it ai n't for you . What are you talking about ? We got to do certificates of deposit . I can print as many as you need . I got my associates here . What do you mean , guys ? Come on . This is not a one-man operation . Look , I can get other guys . What are you talking about , Irving ? I can get other guys . You 're telling me that you can get four guys to sell fake certificates of deposit to my investor within a week ? Yes , I can make that happen . Carl Elway can do what he says he 's going to do .
zone3	got other guys lined up . I got a meeting . Here , look , these are my associates . I got to run . Carl , his associates are here . CARL : Do n't go . He 's got a meeting he 's got to go to . Listen , do n't go ... I got to run . No , do n't go ... No , do n't go . IRVING : Crazy thing about people , the more you say no , the more they want in on something . Yeah , they 're so stupid . I got to run . Come on . I 'll tell them . Do n't worry . Do n't worry . I 'll tell ... Hey , you know what Carl just told me ? He said he could do this whole thing with four guys within a week . Or we could do something much bigger . All right . Something bigger ? Yeah , my guy deals with hundreds of millions of dollars . How much bigger ? Hundreds of ... I knew you were holding out
zone3	? Like , much bigger . Like , I 'm talking about , we could say never the fuck mind the CDs , and we could have some complete access to something huge . RICHIE : Huge ? Like what ? ( GLASSESCLINK ) Robert Spencer . I 'm advisor to the sheik . CARL : Carl Elway . I want you to think of the most undervalued asset in the state of New Jersey today . The rebuilding of Atlantic City . Look , maybe they ... Maybe they legalized gambling a year ago ... Wow . and nothing 's happening . Hey . No licenses , no permits . Quit while you 're ahead , Carl . I know the guy ... I know the right people who are going to help you out . Who 's the guy ? The guy is Carmine Polito . Who 's Carmine Polito ? Carmine Polito ? Carmine Polito , no . RICHIE : My boss , Stoddard , proceeded to tell me that Carmine Polito was the most quietly powerful person in the state of New Jersey . A lifetime
zone3	become a ghetto . And where he had been mayor for ten years . A very beloved guy . A guy who never gave up on his people . His father had emigrated from Italy and had stoked coal . A big family guy with five kids . ( LOUDCHATTER ) They even adopted some other kid , a black kid from the Boys and Girls Club who 'd lost his family . I mean , his household was a joyous place . And his wife , Dolly , well , she was the apple of his eye . And the center of the household . I mean , everyone loved this guy . And he had a huge heart . CARMINE : The WPA employed craftsmen to paint this during the Depression . Why ca n't we employ people today to do work like this in rebuilding Atlantic City ? RICHIE : He worked with all the unions , he was the leader of the State Assembly , and he had just gotten gambling legalized in New Jersey to create jobs . But he could n't get the funds
zone3	. So , with our help , he was about to have his hand in the wrong pocket at the wrong time . And to me , that meant corrupt . STODDARD : You said grifters , con artists . We 're not going after some politician . This is a bad idea , Richard . Look , it 's really simple . All you need is to put two million in a Chase account ... What ? ... under the sheik 's name . Whose $2 million ? Just listen . $2 million under the sheik 's name in a Chase account that we control . Carmine calls up on the telephone , calls the bank and he sees that the sheik is real and he has a real account . Five days . I 'm not taking $2 million of the taxpayers ' money , putting it anywhere for five days . I do n't care if we control it the whole time . Stoddard , let us do what we need to do to rule out corruption and to get rid of the payoff guys that are
zone3	n't smother it , please . You know , Richard , I understand your eagerness . I really do . You know I 'm from Michigan , right ? Let me tell you a story about me and my dad and my brother . We used to go ice fishing every November . Ice fishing , that 's all anybody ... That 's what we lived for . Holy shit . Just listen to me . It 's beautiful . You have a little stove . You huddle around , you keep each other warm . You drop a line and you just wait . One year , my brother says , " Let 's go in October . " He wants to go ice fishing in October . My dad says , " No , the ice is too thin . " My brother says , I love my brother , he says ... I understand . Your brother went out on the ice , the ice was too thin , he fell through the ice , he went in the water ' cause he was too eager ,
zone3	's what you 're saying ? No , that 's not what I 'm saying . What are you saying ? You know , we 'll finish the ice story another time , young man . For now , no Carmine Polito . Go do your job . RICHIE : Stoddard shot the whole thing down . Boring . But Edith was a genius . Yeah , you take me to Brenda . RICHIE : She somehow found this woman who controlled the wire room . A woman I 'd never even heard of . She 's amazing . She 's in charge of all the wire transfers . RICHIE : Way back in a warren buried in the Bureau . She likes cats . This cat lady no one ever even talked to . And Edith met her in the ladies ' room and became friends with her . Brenda ? Hi . Hello . How are you ? RICHIE : This lady handled all the wires , and now she was working with us . She was excited to be included in an operation instead of just being
zone3	you liked exotic booze , so ... It was beautiful . That 's from England . This is from England ? Yeah . That 's right . And I brought you some tea as well . Oh , thank you so much . I mean , nobody ever talks to me . I know . I mean , they just say , " Brenda , do the clerical wiring stuff " and do n't ask questions . " You need to tell Richie about your cats . Oh , my cats ? He loves cats . Oh , my cats ? Yeah . Well , that 's Harry . Look at him standing up ! Is n't that sweet ? And that 's Wendy . She 's a rascal . But Barnaby , that 's another story . Barnaby plays the piano . That 's impressive . We got her to wire $2 million into an FBI-controlled account at Chase . It 'd be there for five days , and if Polito called , he 'd see that the sheik was real . And by the time Stoddard caught up
zone3	by my idea . So , before he even knew it was happening , his boss was calling to congratulate him . The sheik with the money in the bank is a ... RICHIE : Anthony Amado . He had a major hard-on to make a name for himself . I mean , this guy loved the idea of being famous . Do n't be modest . RICHIE : And Stoddard had to say it was his own idea or he 'd look stupid in front of his boss . You made me accept praise from my boss for thanking me for something that never should have happened , something that I did n't approve . You should be happy . There 's imaginative things happening in this office . All right ? We 're not just working in a box . RICHIE : We got the $2 million to put Carmine and the sheik together . Punk . I liked being on this side of the line . But someone had been left out . IRVING : We succeeded because we stayed small . I got you Carl Elway
zone3	's . That 's enough . That 's one . I get you three more , no politicians . You 're going to do this because you got no choice , you work for me . Now , you keep changing the rules . You know , you 're getting a little power-drunk , Richard . You want to tell him , Edith ? You want to wake him up ? Oh , no . I said we should n't do any of it , Irving , you know I said that , so now I support Richie . He 's got vision . Do it heavy or do n't do it . Wait . What does that mean ? I mean , he 's the one ruining America , not me . How the fuck am I ruining America ? Because people just got over Watergate and Vietnam , all right , and you 're going to shit all over politicians again ? And just because you want to be a big shot , get a promotion . No . I 'm thinking big , all right ? This
zone3	surveillance . I 'm doing this from the feet up . You will never do it properly because you got too much government attitude to be small and sleek . I 'm like the fucking Vietcong , man , all right ? I 'm in and I 'm out . I was there the whole time . You do n't know it , all right ? That 's the fucking art of becoming somebody who people can pin their beliefs and their dreams on . And you ca n't do it . How about a suite at the Sheraton Hotel ? For Carmine Polito and rebuilding Atlantic City ... Why not ? you need a luxury hotel for the sheik . Oh , come on . Carmine does backdoor dealings all the time . We do n't have a ... We do n't got a budget for that , Irving . IRVING : You got to knock the mayor , the speaker of the State Assembly , you got to knock him off of his fucking feet , all right ? He 's got to feel like he 's out
zone3	deal , I mean , this is unheard of in the state of New Jersey , maybe even the whole fucking country , all right ? A sheik with hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild Atlantic City , are you fucking kidding me ? That 's gigantic , all right ? And the mayor , he 's going to want to see cash , he 's going to want to see it in an account , he 's going to want to see it right now , and he will check . And that 's why this meeting is n't happening . Because to get millions , you need millions . We already did it . What ? We got the Bureau to park $2 million for three days . We 've got the account numbers . " We " meaning you and him ? Yeah , we did it . Really ? Yeah , me and that guy . RICHIE : She showed me . You showed him our thing ? You did that without me ? Are you kidding ? What are you going to do ?
zone3	playing him ? It 'd be very bad for you if you 're playing me . You 're going to have to decide for yourself , kid . I just laid everything out on the table . It 's all very exciting . I did n't know life could be like this . ( QUIETLY ) You 're pretty wild . You know , we 're taking down a ... A very important politician . Mmm-hmm .

( CARMINELAUGHING ) There 's a lot of green grass in that hotel room up there , all right , and all the deals would float through you . You get a serious piece on both ends , all right ? You do with it what you will . I mean , I live in the real world , all right ? I am a family man . I got mouths to feed and everything like that , but , you know , you got ... We just ... We got to grease you directly . No middlemen , no bullshit , it 's the Arab way . That 's it . That 's it . All right ?

No , look , I understand . I 'll deal with you directly . I do n't want any middleman or any of that bullshit . Done . Done . You and me . Deal with you directly . I like you , eye to eye , we can do business together . That 's fine . Yeah , how long you known this guy ? I mean , you work with this guy before ? I got to work with him . It 's the sheik , all right , you know ... But I still need to meet the sheik , okay ? Yeah . Done . After you . IRVING : I 'm going out for dinner with Carmine and the wives in Camden . RICHIE : Who ? Carmine and myself and the wives . What ? Without me ? IRVING : He does n't like you .
zone3	to come back and take the money . You got him on tape , all right ? I mean , I ca n't make him like you . You know , I mean ... I did my job . Did you tell him that you were working with me ? That I 'm the sheik 's associate ? I just fucking told you , he does n't like you . I mean , let him have a night out with a human being , for fuck 's sake , all right ? He 's going to jail soon . You 're done with him . You got him on tape taking a bribe . RICHIE : Carmine has got to deal with me , Irving . We 're going to use Carmine . Yeah , no , we 're gon na get Carmine 's ... We 're gon na use Carmine to get other people . That 's what we 're gon na do . What ? Like who ? Carmine 's going to use the sheik to pay off people . IRVING : You fucking nuts ? What are
zone3	going to let Carmine show the sheik Atlantic City , how he 's going to renovate hotels , and see who shows up and whoever the sheik pays off for licenses and casinos , that 's who we 're going to go after . We 're going to go after all of them . More politicians ? Yeah . You realize how fucking dangerous that is ? There 's no fucking reasoning with you . All right , Edith and I were so successful for so long because we kept it just small enough . You are taking us to a very fucking dangerous place , with very serious numbers ! If you were that successful , how come you wound up in this room with me right now , taking orders from me ? You 're taking your wife out to dinner ? Your fucking wife ?

Anyway , you can see that it drives him crazy . When you said IRS , what IRS guy ? What are you talking about ? I hear them on the phone . I think that he 's got Irv in some sort of bind or something , and he 's making him do all of this stuff . And so Irv and Carmine right now are at the Plaza Hotel , like , throwing all of this money away at , like , Congress or whatever . They 're giving money to Congress or something .

That you got conned by the very con men who you forced to entrap the members of Congress in the first place ? That 's what you want to go with

Because , what , they 're the easiest to go after ? And what about the real bullshit artists ? You did n't even come close to the big leagues . Those big guys , the money men .

Some of whom , they were just doing business as usual , helping their communities or their states , but some of them knew they had larceny in their blood . And they even
zone3	congressmen , one United States senator and my friend , Carmine Polito . We gave the two million back , so Carmine got the reduced sentence , 18 months . The loss of his friendship would haunt me for the rest of my life . And when the story was written , Richard DiMaso 's name was never mentioned . Syd and I , we moved in together . Rosalyn ...

Past all those skyscrapers and palm trees is my neighborhood , just a few miles from South Beach , but a world away . And growing up in a place like this , you learn pretty quick that you have to speak louder than everyone else if you want to be heard . Because the truth is , everyone has a voice . And there comes a time when you have to shout , to fight for what you want . For me and my friends , that time is now .

We 're more like brothers , I guess . Our folks would go to Ricky 's every night and we 'd be there , these little kids , just wilding out . Then my pops took off . Moms met her new man and ever since then , it 's kind of been us against the world . That 's what it was like for me , too . Me and my dad right after my mom split . We were inseparable . What happened ? I got my own ideas about what I wanted to do . You know ' ? With my life . And he 's had a really hard time accepting that . You should be able to do what you want to do .

Eddy almost lost it in there . And Ricky , I 've never seen him like that . Right now , I think it might make it worse . You want to at least tell me where you 've been ? I was out with a friend . It got late . So you spent the night with some guy ? It was n't like that . Just do n't do it again . I 've got a meeting . Are you planning to build in the Spring Gardens district
zone3	. He lives there . This just keeps getting better . So you spent the night in a slum . - It is not a slum . - Emily ... Daddy , I wish you could see it . The same families have lived there for decades . Every time I build , something else gets knocked down . Someone 's house , someone 's business . It 's the price of progress .

We need to be working on the next Mob . We 've already got over 4,000,000 hits . So you got a lot of hits on YouTube . That 's great . Maybe you 'll win this thing , and you 'll win some money , but it 's not gon na change anything . Believe me . You have 4,000,000 people listening , but you 're not saying anything that actually matters . It 's not okay to make art for fun anymore , and it 's not okay to make trouble either . So what are you proposing ? I 'm saying enough with performance art . It 's time for protest art . Anderson Global Properties is pitching the project to the city council in a week . They have to have the council 's approval to move forward , so ... I think we should join them . So we 're gon

" What do I mean ? You 're sick ? Right , or I do n't want to be here . What if I say , " Good morning , class ! " What 's my subtext ? You 've dropped an E ?

(
zone3	bell_ringing ) There 's a full read-through tomorrow
zone3	Hey . Are you doing anything this afternoon ? Uh , no . Why ? Got a read-through tomorrow . Just wondering if , I do n't know , we could go over some stuff ? Fortinbrass has my dying voice . So tell him , with the occurrents more and less . Which have solicited , The rest is silence . Now cracks a noble heart . Good night , sweet prince . And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest . What happens now ? You 're dead . You know your lines all right . You 're a freak . It 's weird , eh , how much you remember from when you 're little . What do you mean ? Oh , I used to listen to my uncle reads his lines Over and over when he did Hamlet . They rehearsed just across the water . All that for his dad , hey ? Oh , he did n't have much choice , but . What do you mean ? You know , duty and stuff . Do n't know if I 'd do
zone3	. What ? Dying for him ? It 's not like it 's going to bring him back . Besides , he would n't want me to . How do you know ? Because I know he loves me . I found out where Barry Griffen 's living . Yeah ? Eastern suburbs . I 'm gon na pay him a little visit , and I need you there . There 's talk of another riot coming up . That 's our chance . While the cops have their hands full here ... Bang . What about Dad ? This is for Dad , you dickhead . Dad and Uncle Charlie . We got ta show ' em ... we 're still in charge . Then what do you need me for ? To drive . You wo n't even be in the house . I do n't have a license . We 're gon na go shoot this fucker , And you 're worried about not having a license ? Jase might come too , But I do n't what no one else knowing nothing ' , okay ?
zone3	license . You got a black_fella 's license , do n't ya ? Take up the bodies . Such a sight as this becomes the field , But here shows much amiss . Go , bid the soldiers shoot . Okay , what do we think of the end of the play ? CASEY : It sucks . It totally sucks , but that 's what makes it a tragedy . And what about Hamlet 's state of mind ? Do you guys think he was really mad , or insane ? He ... he pretends to be mad so no one suspects him . Maybe . Or maybe so he does n't have to take action at all . Was n't it only when Laertes wanted to fight Hamlet That he was forced to respond ? Liam ? In Act 3 , the King says , " Madness in great one's should not unwatched go . " What does he mean by this ? There 's a reason for him being mad . And the king knows it . That 's why Shakespeare has lasted all these years ,
zone3	Like a deadly MC , Miss . Open to interpretation . CHALMERS : That 's exactly right . Or any great work of art . It 's through art that we can escape , That we can experience a sense of freedom . People use art to try to effect change .

Often appearing to children before taking them away forever . This event was known as the darkness , and began with an infestation of these shadow-like beings . They would then torment their victims until madness or painful death followed . As a desperate last resort , the Anasazi priests trapped the demons inside the ritual stones they used to communicate with the beings . They then hid them deep within the caves that surrounded their homes . If the stones were removed , the demons would be freed . Leading to the darkness descending once more . Ancient writings revealed that this curse could only be lifted by returning the stones to their original resting place . And only by one among them who had no fear . There have been many cases of people who claimed to have located these stones dying mysteriously . Once happy friends and families turned on each other , and random accidents brought death and disaster .

And who 's paying for all this equipment ? The taxpayers ? So now we work for The Hulk ? That 's what we 're doing ? Why do I smell baby oil ? If you keep running your piehole , you 're going to smell an ass-kicking . DOM : All right , Hobbs , you got the best crew in the world standing right in front of you . Give them a reason to stay . Our target is Owen Shaw . Former major in the S.A.S . , Spec-ops soldier . He ran the UK 's Mobility Division in Kabul and Basra . Ah , damn .
zone3	vehicular warfare . Best in the world . - You got some chips ? - TEJ : Those guys do n't mess around . For years , they 've been running jobs in Europe , but it 's their most recent jobs that graduated them to a whole new level . Three targets , highly specific . The program terminal from an ICBM missile ... Got a little change ? TEJ : Seriously ? You 're a millionaire , and you 're still trying to ask for money ? That 's how you stay a millionaire . So what does this all mean ? Well , our best guess is that Shaw 's crew is building a Nightshade device . - Which is ? - A tech bomb . Designed to block an entire military communication grid for 24 hours . If you blind a soldier for a single second in the middle of a fight , he dies . If you blind a country for 24 hours , the loss of life is unthinkable . This could be worth billions to the right buyer . TEJ : Billions ?

I ca n't promise you that . Yes , you can . That 's the deal . Take it or leave it . You get me Shaw , and I 'll get your pardons . You heard him . But this is different .

zone3	, man . You know you 're the prettiest blonde around here . All right , lock it up . We got two things . First off , this is the worst damn city in the world to commit a crime . They got cameras on every street corner . I got video footage from CCTV of the raid . Let 's track that , see where it leads us . And secondly , we just got confirmation on what Shaw 's crew grabbed from Interpol . They ripped off the database of every location that houses the final component that they need . So where are they at ? There are over two dozen of them around Europe . But the list is only good for 96 hours . Which means , wherever Shaw 's crew is going to hit next , it 's going to happen within the next four days . They got a window , and so do we . - We got ta move . - DOM : Hobbs is right . So let 's break this down . You met them . What do
zone3	custom engines . You heard that flip car going through those gears . Sequential transmission . That did n't sound like a normal engine . That was a turbo diesel . It sounded like something you hear at Le Mans . TEJ : Did you see it take all those hits and still stay flat in the corners ? Yeah , hydraulics . Or magnetic suspension . HAN : Who not only has access to the components , but can fabricate something like that ? Maybe a handful of shops in London . Regular tuner shops are n't going to cut it on this one . We 're going to have to dig deeper than that . Han , Gisele , Roman , you 're up . We find the guy who made that car , we find Shaw . - (

You 're talking about twin-turbo V8 , spitting out 560 ponies , son . He reads the brochure . I 'm proud . But with cars , you have to customize . It 's all between you and the car you build . It 's a bond , it 's a commitment . It sounds like a marriage . Yeah , but with cars , when you trade up , they do n't take half your shit . ( HOBBSLAUGHS ) HOBBS : Jesus . With price tags like this , these cars better be made out of gold . You ai n't thinking about stealing these cars , are you , Parker ? Kitchen help entrance is towards the back . Come again ? I do n't mean any offense , gentlemen , but

And your posture , too rigid , no swagger . My guess is military . Take home of 50,000 a year . That 's U.S . Which is not enough to be playing here . So , if you 're not kitchen help , then you must be in the wrong place . But please , do finish your champagne . ( INHALES ) Oh , he needs to be taught a lesson . Like I said , you ai n't stealing these cars . I got this . All right , this is number five on our list . ROME : Holy shit . What 's the dude plan on hunting ? Moby Dick ? HAN : That must be our guy . So , how do you all want to play this ? Han and I got this . We go in tight , you let me do all the talking , and
zone3	one thing you boys are forgetting . He 's a man . Let 's go . " He 's a man " ? You know , she always says that . (

Given that handguns are illegal in the United Kingdom , there 's very few people that have access to that firearm . So if somebody wanted to , say , track down where it came from , it would n't be too hard . I was a cop for a lot of years . Some habits die hard . A pawn shop . ( CHUCKLES ) I do n't know , man .

You 're the last one I 'd have pegged to be sentimental .
zone3	even feel a certain warmth towards you . When I found you in the hospital , and you could n't remember anything , I said to myself , " This girl has a gift . " She 's a blank page .

He 's working with Shaw . What are you talking about ? HAN : It 's true . That phone 's filled with coded payment transactions that lead straight to Braga 's cartel . Who the hell is Braga ? He ran one of the biggest cartels in Mexico . And my old boss . We used codes just like that to move money out of the country . BRIAN : It all makes sense . Braga was running Letty , now he 's working with Shaw . It would explain how the two of them met . TEJ : Okay , so you all know all this information about him , where do we find him ? He 's sitting in a prison in Los Angeles . How do you know that ? ( SIGHS ) Brian put him there . BRIAN : All right ,

You 're wanted , Brian . The moment you step foot off that plane , it 's a wrap . You 're not coming back . " Coming back " ? How are you going to get in the country ? Let me worry about that . ( SIGHS ) This is on me . I 'm the one that served her up to Braga . I 'm the one that gets to make it right . Let me make it right . Be careful . WOMAN : He 's ready to see you now . Right this way . Thank you for seeing us . I wo n't take up much of your time . My men were attacked earlier today . I 'm going to need to see all cameras in and around Waterloo station . Will somebody tell Captain America here - that requires clearance ? -
zone3	62 , earlier today . They 've been down for maintenance all morning . Sorry . Okay . Well , we appreciate your help . Thank you . ( GRUNTING ) You know what I find very interesting is Interpol was attacked recently as well . Those cameras were down , too . Did n't catch a thing . Nothing . Now , that means either your maintenance schedule lines up perfectly with their escape route or it 's someone here that 's working with them . ( CHUCKLES ) And that 's just ridiculous . Because there ai n't no way in hell anybody here would be working for them . Particularly you , ai n't that right ? ( STRAINING ) No , no , that 's ridiculous . That is ridiculous .

You 'll feel a lot better once you get the credit for taking down Shaw . Oh , I 'm tempted to settle for you . Well , you know what they say , Stasiak , if you want the career-changing big fish , you got to be willing to put on the big boy panties and sail out to the deep water . You 're an asshole , you know that ? I missed you , too , man . I really missed you . (

You 've been having a lot of fun out there . Good cop gone bad , Rio de Janeiro . It 's exciting when you go criminal , is n't it ? Too bad you did n't do it earlier , you could have worked for me . Like Letty Ortiz ? So tell me something , because I buried her . Yeah ? You did ? You buried something , I could n't tell you who or what it was . I know she 's running with Owen Shaw . Still playing

He taught me to think global when I was just local . He made me a wealthy man . And this guy did n't just have the cartels working for him . He had the CIA , DEA , everyone in his pocket . He knew what was going to happen before they did . In fact , he even knew when some wet-behind-the-ears FBI agent decided to put some informant in my cartel . (
zone3	tires_screeching ) The minute you put Letty undercover , she was dead , bro . (
zone3	cocks_gun ) ( PANTING ) But she survived . That girl is one tough bitch . Shaw found her in a hospital two days later . He went to finish the job . And he did n't kill her . Why ? She had no memory . Perfect girl , huh ? You 're lucky this door
zone3	your head . ( GRUNTING ) ( GROANS ) Look at me ! Look at me . ( LAUGHS ) You wo n't do it . - ( GRUNTS ) - ( GROANS ) What is Shaw up to ? How do you think he knows your next move before you make it ? He 's got eyes on you . Think about it . The only way you get close to Shaw is if he wants you there . ( WHISTLING ) You 've got some serious balls , man . I 've been told . You know , you 're lucky I missed my shot . I think you hit your mark . Really ? What is it with you ? Do you got a death wish or something ? If that 's what it takes . I just want to race . You might lose your car . ( LAUGHS ) Let 's do it . Your funeral . Ride or die , remember ? (

zone3	sirens_wailing ) Just like old times . This guy is crazy . You got to be kidding me . You 're still upshifting early . I do that so you brake . You lose traction and the back end kicks out . I noticed . Look , just because you know how I ride , does n't mean you know me . You know what they say where we 're from ? Show me how you drive , I 'll show you who you are . V8 . You never could resist American muscle . Nice scar . You never could keep yourself out of trouble , either . What else do you know about me ? About you ? Everything . Like this scar . You got that the first night we met . You were 15 . First street race . Some kid trying to show off lost control of his car , wiped out right next to you .
zone3	And let me guess , you saved me . No . I was the kid showing off . And here ... Boyle Heights . You were fleeing with my little sister Mia and got trapped in a corner . And you thought it was a good idea to ride your Torino Cobra through a retaining wall . ( CHUCKLES ) All right , how about this one ? That 's the last time we were together . In the DR . You wanted to go for a night swim . You cut yourself on the reef . I followed you . I even got this scar to match . ( CHUCKLES ) Look , I do n't know why you 're here , but I really think you 're over your head . I 'm here for you . That girl you remember , it 's not me . Not from what I just saw . Like it or not , you 're still the same girl . I saw it out there . I see it right now . I got to go . Hey . It belongs to
zone3	goes , leaving you again . Bloody fickle , that one . You want bloody ? We could do bloody . ( CHUCKLES ) A street kid , starts out stealing DVD players in East L.A . , ends up heisting $100 million in Rio . Not bad , huh ? It 's a good story , is n't it ? Almost inspiring . See , what I could n't fathom is why he 's not relaxing on a beach somewhere with that cute little Brazilian number . Instead , he 's working with a two-bit government hack like Hobbs . And then I realized , he has a weak spot . We all got a weak spot . You know , when I was young , my brother always used to say , " Every man has to have a code . " Mine ? Precision . A team is nothing but pieces you switch out until you get the job done . It 's efficient . It works . But you ? ( CHUCKLES ) You 're loyal to a fault . Your code is about family .
zone3	, but it makes you predictable . And in our line of work , predictable means vulnerable . And that means I can reach out and break you whenever I want . At least when I go , I 'll know what it 's for . Well , at least you have a code . ( CHUCKLES ) Most men do n't . So , I 'm going to give you a chance . Take your crew and walk away . That 's the only way you 're going to keep your family safe . Your brother never told you never to threaten a man 's family ? It 's a pretty stupid thing to do . ( CHUCKLES ) But I 'll make it simple for you . I walk away when she walks away . Well , then , it appears this inspiring tale has come to an end . If that 's the way it has to go . ( LAUGHS ) Let me guess ... Hobbs . Come on , you son of a bitch . The " two-bit government hack . " ( LAUGHS )

zone3	both_chuckling ) You know , this just got me one step closer to Shaw . For what it 's worth , Toretto , I hope it gets you closer to what you want , too . This better have been worth it . More than you 'll ever know . ( HANDCUFFCLICKS ) SHAW : Pretty . May I ? ( SIGHS ) I 'm going to ask you a question , Letty , and I want you to think very hard before you answer . When I give you the order to take Toretto out , what will your first thought be ? Why do n't you look me in the eye and you tell me what you see . ( CHUCKLES ) Keep it . Tej , talk to me , what have we got ?
zone3	and Dom , but this guy 's smart , so we could only track him so far . He seems to know all the city 's blind spots . See , we lost him somewhere in here , which means he could be anywhere within that half-a-mile radius . Maybe if we cross-reference phone records , leases ... No , this has got Shaw 's name written all over it . We 've got vantage points , multiple exits , subways , highways and storm drains . Bad-ass and brains . Woman , you keep that up , I 'm going to be out of a job . All right , let 's go nail that son of a bitch . They 're long gone . There 's nothing here . ( SIGHS ) There 's never nothing . There 's always something . Let 's go , guys . Shaw , everyone is in place . All things moving according to plan . Good . Send him in . (

All right , let 's cross-reference that with all of Shaw 's military targets . I guaran-damn-tee you one of them is gon na match . Bingo . It 's a NATO base in Spain . That puts Shaw in a different country . That means he 's got an eight-hour lead on us . HOBBS : We got ta move now . Tej , give me that info . Riley and I will go ahead and we 're going to lock down the base . We 're going to protect that component personally . Toretto , I 'll arrange transportation for you and your cars .

HAN : Hobbs and Riley went to lock down the base . - They 're going to meet us there . - BRIAN : Where 's Dom ? He was n't going without you . I found out what happened to Letty . It 's all my fault . Brian , whatever you found out , that 's for you . What we 're about to do now is for her . NATO COMMANDER : We 've got four teams on overwatch , sniper-spotters in roosts north and south of the target . Just keep all your men out of sight . When they drive that truck in here , I want to come crashing down on them like the walls of Jericho . Hobbs , I just caught this one disabling the perimeter security system . - Your house is compromised . - What are you suggesting ? I ai n't suggesting . We follow protocol , we move the component out . Shaw thinks it 's here
zone3	before he arrives . Stealth and speed are going to be our two best friends . We 're going to protect our little egg , move it out of the henhouse , then we 're going to wait for that goddamn fox to arrive . I just got word they caught one of Shaw 's men at the base . It 's time . Something is not right . He wanted us to find that guy . Think about it . At Interpol , you were face-to-face with him . DOM : Brian , so what are you saying ? Braga said the only way you get near Shaw is if he wants you to . Tej , where 's that component ? They 're moving it to a secure location . Shaw ai n't hitting that base . He 's hitting the convoy .

zone3	ca n't believe they stole a 70-ton tank for a three-ounce computer chip . That 3-ounce computer chip is more deadly than 1,000 of those tanks . What about her ? Not her . She was working with Shaw . Was , but she 's always been one of us . Let 's give them a minute . Let 's go process Shaw and his crew . I 've never looked more forward to filling out paperwork in my life . BRIAN : Hey . Look , I do n't even know how to say this to you , but everything that 's happened here is because of me . I 'm the one that put you undercover ... Stop . I may not remember anything , but I know one thing about myself . Nobody makes me do anything I do n't want to . So , what 's our next adventure after this ? How about we stay in one place ? Where are you thinking ? Tokyo . We always talk about Tokyo . Tokyo it is . ( CHUCKLES ) Can I ask you something ?

This code you live by , it 's the very reason why you were n't even in the game . I told you exactly what I was gon na do if you did n't walk away , Toretto . Go ! But you did n't listen . I told you I can reach out and break you whenever I want . And I have . Come on . - Go . - No ! Maybe you should call Mia . ( PANTING ) ( SCREAMS ) (

If I see you on the horizon , I 'll make the call and the girl 's dead . (

zone3	5453821 On October 13 , 2008 , Filmkameratene AS received an anonymous package with two hard disks containing 283 minutes of filmed material . This film is a rough-cut version of that material . Everything is shown in chronological order and no images have been manipulated . A team of investigators spent more than a year trying to establish whether this was a practical joke or if the material was authentic . They concluded that it was authentic . Ready ? Turn on the radio . - Johanna , do you have sound ? - Yes . This is n't working . Bear tracks were found yesterday in Volda . A hunting party arrived there today . The leader of the hunting party had the following to say : We expect to locate this bear fairly quickly . Our real concern is that a poacher has been following us . Only a select few ever get bear-hunting licenses . I know every single bear hunter in Norway . That guy in the Land Rover is no bear hunter . If he 's gunning for our bear , he 's breaking the law . - Have you ever seen him ?
zone3	him again , there 'll be consequences . He 's nothing but a poacher . - What would you like to tell him ? - To lay his cards on the table . Drive ! - There 's too much traffic . - We 're going to lose him ! Ready ? We know his name is Hans , but we have no last name . Thomas , try being more serious . But what is he doing in Volda ? Who is he ? - Do we have sound ? - You have n't plugged in the ... You wo n't get an interview with a poacher . I do n't like it when you ridicule him . That 's great ! Thank you . Bye . Thomas , that poacher is staying at the campground ! I ca n't say I know him , but he is here . He 's staying right over here . Want me to show you ? I do n't know what that smell is , but his camper sure reeks ! - What are all those things ? - I have no
zone3	all night . He 's never back before sunrise . - He stays out all night ? - Yes . Every night . - In good spirits ? - Sure . We do n't know when or if he 'll show up . - There he is ! - I 'm filming . Just ask him directly . Hi . My name 's Thomas . We 're from Volda College . Could we ask you a few questions ? Get lost . Maybe we could come back ... - Did it work ? - Quiet , I hear something . Yes , I 'm on my way out now . I expect to find it tonight . Okay , fine . Bye . - He is n't here . - He was right in front of us ! Sure , but ... - Shit ! - Nice work , Thomas . - Can you see anything ? - Yeah . Some furry things are hanging down from the ceiling . And there 's a shotgun . We 're on our way to where a bear was just found shot .
zone3	this one came from . I 've checked with every registered bear hunter I know . None of them shot this one . The bear population is managed by the state . So a downed bear like this one causes quite a fuss . Look at this . These tracks do n't match the way a bear normally walks . I think someone brought this bear and dumped it here . - That 's weird . - I agree . Very weird . You 're from the Wildlife Board . Finn Haugan , right ? These hunters say those are n't bear tracks . That 's ridiculous . What else would they be ? There is a bear right there , with tracks all around it . - But why are they in doubt ? - Ask them ! It 's crazy . We have waited for Hans for hours , but now he 's finally moving . We think he 's heading somewhere , and we are going to follow him . Go ! It looks like he 's heading for the ferry . How long are we going
zone3	's carrying ? It 's a car tire . - What 's he doing ? - I ca n't tell . Three , two , one , and ... Sogn og Fjordane county ! Okay , he 's over there . Just hide here . We met a little while back . - Really ? - Thomas , from Volda College . - Is that ... - Are you following me ? We just want to ask you a couple of questions . No . Are you ... What were you doing in Volda ? Did you shoot that bear ? Stay the hell away from me . Turn that off . Leave me alone ! Once we get what we need , we can go back . It would be so awesome to get him to talk . We have tried , plenty of times . Do you think Michael Moore gave up after the first try ? Left arm or right foot ? The one you kick with ? We have been here all afternoon . I think he 's sleeping in his trailer . So now we
zone3	. I have to get my sound gear . What is this ? " No trespassing . Blasting area . " Did you see that ? Was that a road ? Did you ? This road is horrible . If we run into a bunch of inbred pig farmers , your ass is first ... - I 'm not ... - Stop whining . - I 'm just being honest . - Want to go back ? - Fine by me . - That 's not what I meant . Hey , wait for me ! Look here . I do n't think he 's in his car . - So we know he 's here ... - But what is he up to ? Here 's a trail . - I hear something in the distance . - What ? Troll ! Thomas ! Hurry ! My car is right over here ! - What ? - Something bit me ! - Are you all right ? - It stings . - You heard him yell " troll , " right ? - Shut up . You need some
zone3	gauze in the first-aid kit . - Ow ! Do n't ... - We have to get this out . You look like hell , Thomas . - What the hell was that ? - Tetanus shot . You yelled something back there in the woods . - You heard him , Johanna . - What 's this slime ? What did he say ? - More ? - Yes . Can you give us a ride to our car ? It is n't very smart to follow me . Did you yell " troll " out there ? - Is that your car ? - What the hell ? - What happened ? - That 's our car ! Someone crushed our car . It 's completely demolished . Look at this , Thomas . - Hans , do you understand this ? - I have an idea . Okay , what ... A bear did n't do this . What do you think happened ? - What ... - Ask him if a troll did it . Hey , if you know what happened to my car ,
zone3	. " - Forget about that ! What the hell do you want ? You want me to say trolls exist , on film ? - You find that funny ? - No , but you do n't actually believe ... If you want a ride , you 'd better come right now . - What should we do ? - I think I 'll walk . You have our bags ? Just so we get this straight : You actually believe trolls exist ? Why are you so sure it was a bear that attacked you ? What 's the matter ? Why are we stopping ? Thanks for giving us a ride . We 'd love to join you , and film what you do . We 'd be very interested . I 'll let you film me killing whatever scratched you , on one condition : You do exactly as I say , no matter what I say . Okay ? Yes . I feel like I 'm bleeding everywhere . - Are you admiring your wound ? - Yuck ! Do n't film that ! -
zone3	Why call them ? - To tell them where we are . He is n't dangerous , just weird . Remember , he runs the show . We do exactly as he says . Then we 'll get our footage . No one here believes in God or Jesus ? Nope . None of us . Do n't look at me . Serious ? Because they can smell " the blood of a Christian man " ? Is that alright ? Close the gate and hang up that sign . NO TRESPASSING . BLASTING AREA . - Is this a land mine ? - Yes . But it is n't armed . I 'm sitting on a land mine ? Are you nuts ? Anyone who does n't want to join me ? Who 's changed their mind ? Who 's afraid of trolls ? - No . - No ? Good . Go down to that creek , take off all your clothes , and scrub yourselves . - Especially your armpits and groin . - No way ! - Why ? - To remove any body odor .
zone3	- What is that ? - Troll stench . - Rub it all over your bodies . - It reeks ! No way . Forget about it . You have to smell like a troll , or they 'll smell us and run away . Christ ! - No . No way ! - I 'm not doing this , Thomas . Forget about it ! You agreed to do exactly as I said . If you do n't do it , I 'll go up there alone and leave you here . Is that understood ? Are you ready ? You 're all greased up ? You look cute . Here , flashlights for you . - What is that ? - A big flash bulb , basically . Hans ? That weapon . How do you use it ? It blasts a powerful ultraviolet beam . UVB rays . The same as the sun , or a tanning lamp . Do n't you know sunlight turns them to stone , Thomas ? - Right . Or they explode . - Have n't you read anything ? I read
zone3	Did you know that , Kalle ? So , what do you do if a troll wants to have an eating contest with you ? Eating contest ? Fairy tales usually do n't match reality . They seem to in this case . - Troll piss . - Christ ! You can smell it all the way over here . Listen , I 'm hunting a Ringlefinch . There 's piss everywhere . He 's marking . Looks like he 's been chased from his territory . He seems sick . I 'd like to find out what 's wrong with him . A blood sample from the troll ? I do n't have the right equipment . You too . Bye . I need help to find out what 's wrong . But a blood sample ... That wo n't be easy . Who were you talking to ? A veterinarian . A vet ! If you wait here , I 'll try to chase the troll out . Is this what you imagined ? I bet it 's going to take him some time to find a troll
zone3	really believes in trolls . Maybe he 's filming us . - That 's probably what he 's doing . - He 's somewhere laughing at us . While we sit here like idiots . Lingonberry ? - In the woods ? - Yes , with no food or water . - Cool ! - What ? It 's a night-vision camera . Listen ! That 's just him . One week , or being bitten by a bear . - It makes for a good story . - You would look ridiculous ! - So I think I 'll choose that . - Being bitten by a bear ? Do you feel that ? I 'm picking up some strange sounds . What is that ? Seriously . What 's going on ? What is this ? This is one real bad joke . It 's a Tosserlad ! Get the hell out of here ! Run , dammit ! - Did you see that ? - Yes . Where did it go ? Do you see it ? Get behind my car ! No ! - Give me
zone3	Thomas ! Kalle ! - Johanna ! - It 's real ! I told you so ! I knew it ! They are real ! - Say something . - It 's been turned to stone ! We ran through the woods ... Why the hell did you say that none of you were Christian ? The way that troll sniffed around ... Obviously one of you believes in God . I do n't believe in God . I sang in a church teen choir ... But that 's because my parents forced me to . I do n't believe in God . I 'm serious . - I can tell it 's not her . - What ? How ? Knock it off . That was some genetically-engineered monster . - That 's a troll . - Nonsense ! Question ! Why does n't anybody know about this ? Because someone does n't want people to know . The government ? Is the government behind this ? Do you work for them ? - Why show it to us now ? - Because I 'm tired of this shitty
zone3	no night bonus . No overtime . No nuisance compensation . Maybe it 's time for a change in troll management . - So if you could get this on TV ... - That should n't be a problem . Come on . You want to see more of these , learn what 's really going on ? You might want to step back . Holy shit ! Anyone need some gravel ? Who the hell is that ? - Who is that ? - I do n't know . Hi there . It 's that guy we filmed ... What is this , Hans ? A film crew ? They wanted to see some trolls . Are n't you that guy from the Wildlife Board ? This is an exceptionally bad idea . Turn off that camera . I have enough problems . The valley is full of dead cattle . I ca n't talk about this on film . Turn off that camera . - Put it down . - We 're allowed to film here . - Sure you 're on top of this ? - Totally
zone3	take care of the rest . PIOTER 'S POLISH PAINT SERVICE The Ringlefinch is still out there . Then find it ! Two German tourists disappeared last night . - We expect to lose a few more . - That is n't my problem . If you think I 'll let you keep those recordings , you 're wrong ! It says " Pioter 's Polish Paint Service . " What exactly is your job description ? My job is to kill any troll that breaks out of its territory - and comes near people . - How often do they break out ? Rarely . This is a special situation . Too many trolls are out and about . Finn is a ... bureaucrat . He works for TSS . His primary job is to prevent ... To keep people from knowing that trolls exist . In one sense , you are a true Norwegian hero . No , you 're wrong about that . There 's nothing heroic about what I do . It 's dirty work . How can no one know about this ? Let 's
zone3	them for a fortune . We ca n't do that yet . We have to keep following him . Finn is pissed off . - Now what ? - Breakfast . - You should eat something too . - I 'm not hungry . I feel a little ... nauseous . How many types of troll are there ? You have two main groups : Mountain trolls and woodland trolls . The subgroups include Ringlefinch , Tosserlad , Rimetosser . Mountain Kings . The Harding , out west . But that troll we saw ... Do they all have three heads ? No , there are many variations . The heads develop as they age . They are n't born with three . They are usually born with one . The others appear later . They only have an eye in the middle , the original , head . The other heads are n't really heads . They 're a sort of protuberance . Their function is to scare other trolls . Or impress the females . What is that form ? - What does TSS stand for ? -
zone3	form after each kill . Location , gender , whether it blew up or turned to stone ... SLAYED TROLL FORM In fairy tales , trolls wear clothes and talk like people . - They 're just like people . - Fairy tales are for kids . Trolls are animals . Predators . They eat , shit and mate . Eat anything they can . - How old can trolls get ? - 1000 , 1200 years . - And their intelligence level ? - In the pits . They are not bright . They manage to eat . But how hard is it to survive on rocks ? I once saw a troll try to eat its own tail . His head between his legs , he tried to suck down his own tail . He started gagging on it , tipped over and rolled down a hill like a wheel . - I was a Navy Ranger . - And that led you to troll hunting ? No , they were looking for someone who could ... - So you 're the only one in Norway ? -
zone3	sorts of crap . - Do they eat people ? - You want to offer yourself ? - No . But have they eaten people ? - Are those troll tails ? - Yes . Some skinned , some whole . - Why ? - So it smells like troll in here . Why do you want a troll smell ? So I can approach the trolls without them noticing . - Tanning lamps ? - Yes . - You can get skin cancer . - I use sunscreen . I have trouble sleeping in the dark . - Is that what we rubbed on ourselves ? - Yes . - What is it ? - Concentrated troll stench . A mixture of all the crap you can squeeze out of a troll . Let 's go find that Ringlefinch before he eats every animal in the county . Two German tourists were found killed by a bear . Finn Haugan from the Wildlife Board is investigating the tragedy . Do you know where the troll might be ? No . What are you looking for ? Rock slides ,
zone3	- Do I look like that famous painting ? - Yeah . Maybe you should see a doctor ? - Do you really feel sick ? - It comes and goes . - Are we safe here ? - They only come out at night . Kalle , ca n't we ... It has n't been triggered . Some small trolls have taken the bait . Concrete and charcoal is an unbeatable combination . - Do it now ! - Now ? Hans thinks he has found the trail of a Ringlefinch ... Hans thinks he has found tracks . Some farmers have found sheep carcasses nearby . Hans thinks there 's a link between the two . Hurry up ! Global warming has led to changes in our flora and fauna . These tracks you see around here ... are from a Russian bear that came through Finland and Sweden . The bear stores its food here under the bridge . - Is n't that strange behavior ? - Not for Russian bears . Due to the long , hard winters , they store their food . Just like
zone3	That 's the left foot . And the right foot is over here . Has the bear walked cross-legged ? I assume you have seen bear tracks before . Hey , what about those tracks ? He 's gnawed at the bark . Typical Ringlefinch behavior . He 'll be back tonight . I have something to lure him with . - And then you 'll kill him ? - Yes . But first , I need to get that blood sample . Is this the syringe ? This is horrible ! It 's cruelty to animals . Cruelty ? He 's just using them as bait . You 're too far away . Move closer . No , I 'll just zoom . We can see fine from here . What working hours ... We 've been here forever . Maybe no troll will show up ? - We can see fine from here . - But we can see better from there ! Come on . It 's here . Hear that ? Run ! God , I hate this crap ! Keep your distance . I 'm
zone3	Move back ! Shit ! Kalle ! Thomas ! Move ! Move over ! Are you alright ? Hey ... Are you alright ? Help him up . - Come on , Hans . - Are you alright ? Careful with that red button . Give me the syringe . Stay up there . Now we know that trolls also explode . - How are you doing ? - Fine , thanks . Could 've been worse . Just a little sore . A little sore ? This is crazy ! At least I got the blood sample . I 'll be there in a half hour . Thanks . Bye . You look like a newborn ! It 's just a film team . They have some questions . ? RDAL PET CLINIC - Is that the blood ? - Yes . - It was quite a struggle . - I can tell . You 're a mess ! - Thanks . - There 's a bathroom in there . - What do you see ? - There are n't enough red blood cells . This will take me
zone3	interview ? If you could just stand ... or maybe sit over there . - What should I tell them ? - Everything . - We are n't allowed . - I take full responsibility . The trolls ' main problem is that they ca n't convert vitamin D from the sunlight , into calcium . So when they are exposed to bright sunlight , their bodies overreact . Their stomachs expand . Gases are forced into their intestines and veins . This becomes unbearable . - And they explode ? - They explode . - But some trolls turn to stone . - Yes , the older one's . Their veins are too constricted , so the expansion occurs in their bones . In a matter of seconds , everything calcifies and they turn to stone . I wish they did n't have to experience such pain . It is traumatic for them , even though it only takes a few seconds . We would have preferred to give them an injection . - I 'll have the results in a few days . - And you 'll call
zone3	to go ? - Sure . - Why all these local newspapers ? - To collect information . - About what ? - Trolls . Accidents and things that have happened , that trolls are behind . - I have files back there . - Can I take a look ? - " Road disappeared . " - People want natural explanations . But if you know what to look for , you 'll see what 's caused by trolls . This bridge was smashed by a wading troll that bumped his head . Are there trolls that big ? Yes , the Jotnar . I 'm the only person to have seen one . There 's a mountain troll territory on the Finnmark plateau . And one on the Hardanger plateau . Three in Jotunheimen , one in Dovre . We have to find out where the problem lies . Jotunheimen is closest . We are on our way to the first territory Hans wants to check . At the moment , we are circling around the territory . The territory ends up here , and because this tire
zone3	territory . If they had left , they would have gnawed on this tire . Smile ! Film over there . Trolls love to gnaw on old car tires . One has tried to kick his way into the good stuff here , but failed . - How many trolls are there ? - Impossible to say . You must have some idea ? The gestation period is 10 to 15 years . And they only have one kid . - Are they mammals ? - Yes . Let 's see ... One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . This looks fine . All the stones are in the same position . This is apparently a battle area . Mountain trolls and woodland trolls often come to blows here . They throw stones at each other . But there has been little activity here lately . The guy behind us is paying . Is n't that what they say ? Remember that big Jotnar ? They live here in Jotunheimen . - Where ? - Inside the mountains . - What
zone3	ate an entire loaf of bread . Finn refuses to give in . He claims all the runaways are from Dovre . Because he does n't see any in this satellite photo . But you ca n't see trolls in satellite photos ! Let 's get to the bottom of this . We are on our way to a farm that was on the local news recently . Hans thinks it 's troll related . Wow , look at that ! Did you get that ? - What happened here ? - A tornado . - Did you see it happen ? - No . Look at the position of those trees . They should all point in the same direction . Who showed you that map ? They did n't say who they were . But they had fancy weather charts and satellite images . And we saw what looked like a tornado . At least three trolls ran though here and continued northward . How can it be that no one sees huge beasts rampage across a field like this ? We 'll come back tonight . Head
zone3	do n't like this . - Let 's stick together . Seriously , Kalle . We have to follow him . What do you think we should do ? There are tracks further in . Here 's their trail . They 've passed through here . - We ca n't stay here alone . - This way ! An abandoned mine . - They 've been here . - I 'm not going in there ! There are n't any trolls there now . Come on . - Are you sure ? - Sure . No , there 's nobody home . I need the troll stench . - Here . - I can take the camera . Everything okay ? A whole pack of trolls lives here . This is a lair . - We can leave . - Come on , let 's get out of here ! Let 's go . Come on ! I 'm coming ! Closer to the wall ! Head back inside ! Quick , in here ! Turn off your flashlights ! I have to get out of here . - Do
zone3	not here . Just relax . Breathe easy . Calm down . - Why are you so nervous ? - I 'm Christian ! - We 're going to die ! - Damn ! You 'd better not start sweating ! Dear Lord ... Shut up ! Run ! Sunlight ! It still works . There are more in there . I 'll have to get them later . Mountain Kings . Why did n't he just say he was Christian ? I have to go to Dovre to find out why they keep running away . I can give you a ride down , if you want to quit . - What are you doing ? - Looking for those tapes . In my trailer ? - Are you filming ? - No . - It 's out of control . - Why are n't you up there ? I refuse to go into their territory . There 's no way . - Turn off that camera . - It 's off . But do n't people have a right to know ? - What is your job ?
zone3	have a right to know ? People are dying ! Why is this so secret ? - People have a right to know . - No . - Hands off the camera . - This is none of your business . Yes , this happens to be my business ! - Get lost ! - This is n't over . I 'm going to check it out . Do you want to join me ? - Yes . - Are you ready for that ? - Yes . - Okay , let 's keep on filming . Let 's find a new camera and continue . Here comes our new camerawoman . Malica . - Malica . - Thomas . You are not Christian . - You do n't believe in Jesus or God ? - I 'm a Muslim . Excellent . Muslim is okay , right ? I honestly do n't know . We 'll see what happens . - It must be okay . - We 're filming musk oxen , right ? No , not exactly . - Let 's go . - Yes , we
zone3	. - Where have you worked ? - Norwegian TV , BBC ... - I just filmed some lions in Tanzania . - Lions . Good . I 've never seen anything like this . Holy shit . They 've broken every single tree over several acres . I assume what has happened is that a Jotnar has run through here . A giant , over 200 feet tall , has chased the Dovre trolls down here . We do n't want Jotnars running around . Give me a break . Do you all actually believe in trolls ? You think a squirrel rampaged through here ? If only the trolls were happy . But TSS wants to keep a lid on everything . Those may look like normal power lines , but they 're electric fences to keep the trolls at bay . I do n't know how they broke through . I 'll have to check . Let 's go visit the clowns in charge of the power grid . - Do they know about the trolls ? - No way . Have you had any problems up
zone3	You can hang your coats here . Over here . Several hundred meters of power line , knocked to the ground . 300,000 volts . - When did this happen ? - Three weeks ago . - Do you know how it happened ? - No . No one does . Those cables are supposed to withstand hurricanes . We have no clue . - Is this a school project ? - Yes . Volda College . - Are you a teacher ? - No . Where does that line go ? It runs from here ... then north , in a loop , and back to here . - So it runs in a circle ? - Yes , exactly . You do n't find that strange ? Maybe a little . - Yes , it is strange . - The power leads to nowhere . Well , it does lead in a circle . And in a beautiful landscape . If a Jotnar runs through a power line , something is seriously wrong . I 'd better get up there and try to find it . The territory
zone3	pylons . Activists and farmers always complain . I think they 're pretty . Those were placed out here as food for trolls . This is the territory . We have been here . And here . And no sign of trolls . I think we should try this area next . There 's a TSS cabin up there where we can wait . Some scientists say it is caused by natural phenomena , while others more than 1000 quakes registered ... We are in a troll territory now . You do n't seem to like entering these territories . Is there some particular reason ? There was a mountain troll territory up in Strynefjell . Back in the ' 70s they decided to build tunnels through that troll-rich area . Both the TSS and I tried to object , but to no avail . I was given the task of going in and exterminating all the trolls . Every last one . Pregnant females . Kids . Newborns that had n't even learned to walk . It was a massacre . Hans ' entire life has revolved around trolls
zone3	trolls . In many ways , he is a superhero here in Norway . What would we have done without him ? That makes it all the more important for us to make this movie . My shoulder . Are you alright ? The sun will be up in an hour . Should we go too ? He sounds a bit big , but I 'll give it a shot . It sounds like he 's snapped completely . This could be problematic . Your phone is ringing , Hans . - Where is it ? - On my seat . Thomas speaking . He 's a little busy right now . Can I ... Rabies ? - That Ringlefinch had rabies . - Let me talk to Hilde . Hi Hilde . Are you sure ? That makes sense . Okay . You take care too . Bye . I 'll bet all the trolls we 've met had rabies . This guy has spread it to the Ringlefinches and Mountain Kings . - And even to you , Thomas . - Me ? I do n't have rabies
zone3	rabies , you have to get to a hospital . If you think he has rabies , he needs medical attention ! I do n't have rabies . You ca n't just say I have rabies ! If so , we need a hospital now ! - That beast is on its way . Get inside ! - I could n't care less ! - We ca n't stay in here . - Look ! Is it coming this way ? Go outside ? Are you crazy ? He 's leaving ! Do n't move ! I 'll try to lure him this way . What a friend we have in Jesus ... What is he doing ? What 's happening ? The flash ran out of power . Definitely rabies . Can we go to the hospital now ? - No , he needs a few more doses . - What are you talking about ? But first I have to wear him out . He 's closing in on us ! - Now we 're getting away ! - Good . - There 's somebody up ahead !
zone3	Hurry , dammit ! Go ! Go ! - Where are you going ? - Stay here ! - Hans ! - Get back inside ! Oh my God ! Get back in the car ! - Who are you ? - A seismologist . I have to get in front of him . Look out ! Is it on ? Hans , what are you doing ? I have to give him the finishing blow ! - With that ? - Yes . I hope you have all the footage you need . This road will lead you to the highway . There 's no more roaring ! Malica ... Stop fooling around . That 's troll on tape . Here is the footage . Am I bleeding ? What did you say ? - Are you okay ? - Sure , I 'm fine . Look ! Over there ! Is n't that Finn and the others ? Shit , it 's Finn . Give me the camera ! Thomas , what are you doing ? The recordings end here . No body was ever found in the
zone3	a trace . We strongly encourage anyone with information about their fate to contact Filmkameratene AS or your nearest police station . It has been impossible to get the Government to confirm the existence of the Troll Security Service . However , an indirect confirmation was given during Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg 's biannual press conference in Oslo on June 25 , 2010 . The press did n't get the point . We want to protect the Norwegian environment as best we can . Few people find power grids attractive . I certainly do n't . Norwegians are pro electricity , but against power lines . That wo n't work in the long run . Norway has trolls , so more power lines are needed . - That 's just the way it is . - That 's a wrap ! TROLLHUNTER Subtitles : Nick Norris

I think the men would all agree that , uh , We 'd love to go in there and check on the score of the game . BUCK : I would second that . Glennzo ? - Score of what game ? - The U.T . Game . - Hook ' em , horns . - GLENN : Oh , right . Right . - No , that 's the devil sign . ( LAUGHING ) - You guys go watch the fucking game already . - Yes , please . Great idea . Yeah . Sure . Let 's eat . Have
zone3	na resist a lady 's offer . ( CHUCKLES ) Come on . No . Great . Glenn , you 'd better go . It 's gon na get all vaginal in here . Okay . All right . New word , please . She ca n't say the v-word . No , I can say it . I know it 's ... ( LAUGHS ) I can say it . I just ... you can go . Is it okay ? Um , is it okay to go ? Oh , yeah , yeah . Okay . I just wanted to ... ( STATIC ) Bye , Glenn . He 's so cute . He just asked for your permission to get up . He 's so cute . I 'm gon na introduce him to my father . ( LAUGHS ) Okay . Wait . I want to know what happened to brad . It turned out he was fucking crazy . - What ? - Right . He did n't seem crazy . What do you mean right ? How can every guy you ever date ...
zone3	I do n't know . I really know how to pick ' em . Are you saying it 's me ? - No , no . - What was crazy about him ? How was he crazy ? Perfect example . I needed some mouthwash . So I 'm at his apartment , and I open the medicine cabinet , And there are giant glass jars of nail clippings and human hair . - Ew ! - Wait , that 's not crazy . His or someone else 's ? Does it even matter ? Well , I asked him about it , and he said , " I do n't know . That 's just how I was raised . " - Well , that makes sense . - No , that 's not right . Wait . Whoa ! Whoa ! He does n't know any difference . It 's disgusting . Why were you looking for mouthwash at his apartment ? Oh , we just went right over that part , did n't we ? Because I am a lady , and I like to have fresh
zone3	. PETE : Do you have picture ? BUCK : Nope . Not yet . Hey , who 's , uh ... who 's this other guy in the picture with tracy ? That 's , uh ... brent ? No , that 's roger . Uh , that is roger . Yeah . Yeah . He was a good guy . I liked him . BUCK : He was cool . SHANE : Yeah , that was short-lived though . Hey , guys , I do n't mean to freak your minds out , but I have $65 riding on the game today . ( PETEWHISTLES ) Hey , uh , Glenn . No need to tell the ladies that , all right ? Yeah . Right . SHANE : Pete , your internet 's out too . What ? Yeah , well , one thing at a time . Uh , Pete , how long y'all been married ? Eight years . Lexi and I actually met at their wedding . She was a bridesmaid , and I was in the band . And he was told not
zone3	fraternizing with the guests . Yeah . And rules are made to be broken , dude . If I had n't broken your stupid rules , where would I be today ? Probably someplace where the internet 's working . And how long have you and Lexi been married ? Eight years . But I thought you said ... but you met at the ... Sang on a Saturday , sexed on a Sunday , married on Monday . It 's true . Dude , look , when I met Lexi , I knew that she was the one and that it would be perfect together . And we did n't give a shit what our parents or sponsors ... Or anybody else had to say about it . We marched on down to city hall and we laid it to rest . That 's great . Congratulations . She seems like a great gal . Then we went to a T.G.I.F . Fridays , got wasted , Consummated in the bathroom . Yeah . There ... that ... that place is fun . How long have you and Hedy
zone3	no , we 're not married , uh , yet . We 're engaged . Oh , great , great , great . How long you been engaged ? Uh , six years . You 've been engaged for six years ? Yeah . Just ' cause two people get engaged ... Does n't mean they have to get married right away . - No , no . Of course ... - And there 's no need to succumb to pressures ... - Just ' cause society says you should . - Totally agree with ... I think that you should set the date when the time is right . You know , when both people are secure in their careers ... And can afford a nice home and , uh , you want to start a family . Yeah , and cars can fly . What was that ? Huh ? I think , uh ... I think Hedy 's getting pretty close to setting a date . Oh , yeah . Yes . Oh , you 're the one who 's ... oh . Oh , I mean
zone3	I meant ... Well , you know how , uh , traditionally , the ... the ... ( STAMMERING ) Uh , hey , where is the ... yeah . Restroom . Oh , sure . Sure . It 's upstairs to the left . Upstairs to the left . To the left . What 's traditional ? Hey , do n't forget to jiggle the handle . It 'll just keep running . You should just maybe change the channel . Maybe it 's just the one station . No , I really tried everything . Uh , did somebody forget to pay the cable bill this month ? It 's not that . We have the whole bundle , package thing . Internet , tv , land line . ( BEEPING ) Who still has a land line ? - It 's for faxing . - Who still faxes ? The guy who owns this tv still faxes . Got nothing here . That makes sense , yeah . (
zone3	beeping_continues ) Are you fucking kidding me ? Huh . ( HANDSETSETTLESINCRADLE ) LEXI : We 're walking
zone3	to us , and he 's , like , " do you want some blow ? " As if he had heard us talking about it inside ! Like an angel or something . No , I think they 're called drug dealers . ( LAUGHS ) So we gave him some dough , and he hooked us up with some primo shit . We hung out with the white lady till , like , 7:30 . Wait . When was this ? Last night . - Are you kidding ? - No . - Did you sleep ? - No . I 'll sleep when I 'm ... Well , you 're gon na sleep when you 're dead . How many times do we have to tell you how bad cocaine is for you ? All your little angels shot down . You 'd think I 'd stop telling my drug stories to doctors and chemistry teachers . Yeah , you 'd think , but you still do it . And if you want to sing , it 's gon na fuck up your whole nasal cavity .
zone3	What are you talking about ? - You knew you were moving out so you did n't pay the bills . - What ? - What ? I paid the bills like I pay them every month ... Because you 're too lazy to do it . Well , then why is our internet , cable and land line out ? - Who has a land line ? - It 's for faxing . Emma , why are you moving out ? Do you honestly think that I am so childish that , what , I would purposely sabotage your new bachelor pad ? Yeah . I think you 'd think it 's hilarious . I bet you did n't pay the electric bill because you thought it would be funny ... If I bumped into shit in the dark . I paid the goddamn electric bill . ( SIRENSWAILINGINDISTANCE ) ( CHUCKLES ) - I had nothing to do with this . - Of course not . Hey , bro , I think your power 's out . Yeah , you fucking think ? - Whoa , whoa ,
zone3	? Do n't waste your time , man . It 's not worth it . Emma , why are you moving out ? Whoa , wait . Emma 's moving out ? That 's what she said . Why ? - Well , ask her . - Why ? - I never said I was moving out . - I did . So you 're moving out ? No , I said that Emma 's moving out . ( TOGETHER ) Why ? Because we 're getting a divorce ! ( SIRENSWAILINGINDISTANCE ) I thought you wanted to wait until the end of brunch . Well , I guess someone let the cat out of the fucking bag ... When he revealed I was moving out . So you really did n't pay the electric bill ? No , I paid the fucking bill ! You guys know the power 's out , right ? Yes ! ( TOGETHER ) We know ! Did I miss something ? Pete and Emma are getting a divorce . Really ? Why ? Okay . You know what ? This is not how
zone3	wanted to wait until the end of brunch to tell you , But we 've just decided that it 's what 's right . That 's really vague . EMMA : Well , it 's complicated , Lexi . Marriage is complicated . You know that . So it 's a mutual thing . PETE : Yeah . It 's not like one of us caught the other one cheating or anything . This is n't happening . No , you 're not getting a divorce . No , you 'll still see us , okay ? Just not together . Well , you know , maybe physically together , but not together together . But what we do n't want is people picking sides . We really want to remain close friends with all of you . Yeah . Unless some of you feel very strongly about one of us over the other . Tracy , for instance , If you want to stay in touch with Emma and completely shut me out of your life , - I 'd understand . - No , Pete , I would
zone3	. You do n't need to make a decision now . So does this mean brunch is over ? Do you want us to leave ? Shane , they just told us they 're getting a divorce , - And you 're still thinking about Alpha Force ? - Alpha flight . I honestly did n't know if they wanted us to leave , Because I have a feeling it 's about to get a little uncomfortable . Oh , do you have that feeling ? Which is exactly why I wanted to wait until after we ate to bring this up . ( SIGHS ) You know what ? He 's right . It is about to get uncomfortable . But I 'll be the one who 's leaving . ( MOUTHINGWORDS , SIGHS ) ( SIGHS ) ( WATERGURGLING ) Oh , hey , I think the power 's out . Shut the fuck up , glenn ! I am so sorry . I did n't mean that . I 'm under a lot of stress right now , and I 'm taking it out on you .
zone3	. Oh ! Oh , did you suddenly want to talk in private now ? Emma , come on . You ca n't leave . How many times are we gon na have this conversation ? No , right now . You ca n't leave right now . (
zone3	sirens_wailing ) This is the last time we 're all gon na be together like this . (
zone3	sirens_blaring ) The last of our famous couples brunches . Have you ever , in the last eight years ... No . You know what ? Let 's go farther back when we were dating . So let 's say 12 years . Have you ever in the last 12 years ... Truly looked forward to one of these couples brunches ? (
zone3	sirens_wailing , BLARING ) Well , what do you mean " looked forward to " ? Look , Emma , you did n't even pack any socks . Well , I 'll buy more . Where are you gon na go ? It does n't matter . Maybe , uh ... no , she 's not supposed ... that 's
zone3	or toothpaste . I 'll get them at the same store where socks are sold . Emmers , wait ! Do n't call me that ! Um , enjoy my quiche . ( SIRENSWAILINGINDISTANCE ) ( SCREAMS ) What ? Um , there 's a ... there 's a man ... - A man ? - He 's wearing a hazmat suit . ( KNOCKING ) It 's Hal . - What ? SHANE : - Who 's Hal ? - He 's our neighbor . - Does he always wear a hazmat suit ? What does Hal want ? EMMA : I do n't know . Is there a reason to be afraid of hal ? No , he 's nice . I mean , he does n't mow his lawn enough , but I do n't ... Can I suggest that maybe we let him in ... And then we can find out what he wants , from his mouth . ( KNOCKING ) (
zone3	door_closes ) Pete . Hey , hal . Emma . Hey , hal . You guys having a party ? Just brunch .
zone3	my invite . It 's a couples thing . Oh . Oh , okay . So I invite you guys to all my game nights , My barbecues , but since linda left me , I guess I do n't even socialize anymore . No , hal , we did n't ... no , we never intended to ... I mean ... Hal . Hal , why are you wearing a hazmat suit ? Are you kidding ? You really do n't know you 're wearing a hazmat suit ? - You guys have n't heard ? - Heard what ? That a bunch of dirty bombs were set off downtown . Uh , what 's a dirty bomb , bro ? It 's a radiological weapon . It combines radioactive material and conventional explosives . I 'm sorry . Is this like ... are you joking ? No . I was watching the U.T . Game , and the news cut in . You guys did n't notice that the power and the cell phones and land lines all went out ? You just thought you forgot to pay
zone3	What was the blast radius ? Five or six . It was right downtown . Oh , my god . It took out half the financial district . - Most of Messenier Park . - Oh , I love that park . God , I hope the taffy guy is okay . That 's like ... that 's like 12 miles away . If five or six ... yeah . Then the national news cut in . They said there were attacks on los angeles , new york , orlando . And they were about to say more , but the tv cut out . Orlando ? Someone thinks orlando is on par with new york and los angeles ? Did they say who did set them off ? Were there any ships or ... - Ships ? - You know , were the attackers not of this earth ? Anyway , the radiation cloud is probably coming . So I would recommend that you guys probably tape up your windows , Close the air vents , put on your hazmat suits . Who the fuck has a hazmat suit
zone3	, if we 're supposed to stay inside , then what are you doing here ? Batteries in my emergency flashlight died , so I was gon na see if you had any extras . What kind of batteries ? ( CHUCKLES ) I do n't ... what do you even use " d " batteries for ? Emergency flashlights . Do you want to check ? We do n't have any . Yeah . No . Okay . Well , you guys enjoy your couples-only brunch . Yeah , wait , wait , wait . You ca n't just leave us here like this . Yeah , I can . So that just happened . ( CHUCKLES ) Whoa ! That was awesome ! Who is that dude ? It 's finally going down . It 's going to be fine . I just need my adderall . Well , I guess I 'm not going anywhere . Okay . Uh , all right . Uh , we heard what he said . Right ? - We need to secure the house . - Okay , you do n't
zone3	probably just huffing some paint fumes in his garage ... And making this up to screw with us . No , it makes sense . It 's invasion 101 . You cut off all lines of communication to keep the locals confused . Radio ! If this is for real , it 'll be all over the radio . What about the one my mom got us for christmas ? - No . I sold that at a garage sale . - What ? Why ? Because we already have a clock by the bed , and that one was really ugly . - When did we have a garage sale ? - I had one when you were in singapore for your convention . - You had a garage sale when I was out of town ? - I did ! You keep everything ! Another radio ? Guys , do you have another radio ? Is there another radio besides that one ? How about some of us look for a radio ... And the rest of us gather supplies so we can seal up the house ?
zone3	that 's ... that 's cool too . Break ! ( SIGHS ) I 'll keep an eye on the window . All right . ( SIRENSWAILINGINDISTANCE ) When was the last time we cleaned this ? This is ridiculous . Oh , my god . " d " batteries . Oops . You guys have enough rat poison down here to kill Chuck E . Cheese . What is the deal ? Costco is the deal . Ohh ! No . No ? Oh , sweet ! You found a radio ! ( GRUNTS ) Check it out . ( SIGHS ) ( SIGHS ) I do n't think that 's gon na help out in our current situation . Can we just focus on the task at hand ? What if a bunch of marauders come and we need to whack them with something ? ( CRASH ) Hedy ? Hedy ? - God ! There 's so much spackling tape ! - Hey . Hey . It 's gon na be all right . Hey , why did n't you tell me ? About what ? About
zone3	having his conversation ? Hedy ! Oh . - How long have you known ? - I do n't know . A couple of months . A couple of months ? Yeah . Well , divorce is complicated ... And it takes a lot of research . You have to be legally separated . You have to fill out all these forms . There 's just ... there 's a lot of bureaucratic bullshit . - So then you knew when we had our ... - Yes , of course I did . Nah . That 's cool . Holy crap . Are you disappointed ? - You 're disappointed . - Eh . What ? You get , like , more philandering points or something ... If the woman 's happily married ? It 's not that . It 's just less of a challenge . It 's like when you 're bowling and they put the things in the gutter . You 're unbelievable . Shane . - Hey . - I think you need to go and help Hedy out . With what ? She 's in
zone3	No , no , no . Like shock shock . Like real shock . Okay . I 'll be there in a minute . Look , we need to talk . Wait . What ? Why ? I do n't know if your apathetic attitude is some sort of coping mechanism ... Due to the stress at hand , which is fine . Dude , no stress . None of this shit is real . Is anyone infected ? Infected with what ? With whatever 's out there . But we do n't know what 's out there . And that 's exactly what 's scaring me . I mean , how many times have you seen on the news ... That someone thought , like , a weather balloon was a U.F.O ... . Or a bear was a giant sasquatch ? Just because the media reports something ... ( CANRATTLING ) Does n't make it true . Do n't even get me started on the supposed " moon landing . " Have you seen any bite marks , scrapes ? No ? Uh ... All right , well
zone3	you let me know . Weirder than you 're acting right now ? We might have to make some tough decisions . Okay . I 'm gon na go check on Hedy . Thanks . I appreciate that . God ! I do n't even know what we 're looking for ! Duck tape . Duct tape . That 's what I said . Oh , yeah ? Say it again . Duck tape . Duct . Duct tape . With a " t . " It 's for sealing ducts . You just blew my mind . Maybe you 're right . Maybe this is a hoax . I hope it 's a hoax . But the wise thing to do is let 's get a radio , find out for sure . All right ? Whatever floats your boat . Well , that floats my boat . Okay . Well , I ca n't remember the last time I bought a radio , except for my car . Ohh . Hey , uh , where are your car keys ? Huh ? Your keys . - Where you
zone3	need your keys . They 're sit ... flamingo key chain . Well , there 's ... there 's two here . It 's the bluish one . Emma and I used to ... There 's blue on both of these . But this is hilarious . Em and I used to have this thing ... Where we 'd stop by every photo booth and get pictures of ... ( LAUGHS ) There 's ... ( SIRENSCONTINUE ) ( EXHALES ) Hey . Hey . What 's up ? I , uh , saw you talking to glenn . Yeah . What do we know about that guy ? He 's a teacher . He likes scotch . - Can he be trusted ? - With my car keys ? When the shit goes down . The shit . Pete , things are gon na degrade very quickly . The rules of society are gon na break down , And your life is gon na be in the hands of the people you can trust . Okay . Do you have any weapons ? - Weapons ? - Guns ,
zone3	some chinese throwing stars ... That my uncle brought back from dallas . Yeah ? Pretty sharp , so ... Oh , these are nice . (
zone3	metallic_ringing ) All right . Let 's just keep this between us . Okay . ( SQUEALING ) Oh ! Hi , glenn . ( SIGHS ) Are we going somewhere ? No . You know , I lost my virginity in a saab . ( SEATBELTBUCKLES ) This is n't a saab . Just making conversation . Where 'd you lose your virginity , glenn ? ( ? POP ) - Oh , I love this song . ? I need to get out and find the love of my life How do you make it go to the radio ? ? Things can get so good Lexi . ( BEEPING ) " no user is connected " ? What ... Must be a satellite subscription . Satellite ? Satellite radio . 200 commercial-free channels for 15 bucks a month . There 's this new Agey one I really like . It 's called the Chakra . Oh , Glenn , where
zone3	? ( BEEPS ) ? Things can get so good ... ( **26;2509;TOOLONG ) ( CARALARMSBLARING ) We should go camping soon , dude . We have n't been camping together in years . I 'm gon na organize it . I 'll set it up . Cool . ( SIGHS ) I do n't see anything . Radiation 's usually invisible . No , no . People . I do n't see anyone . ( EXHALES ) I do n't even see dogs . What kind of neighborhood does n't have dogs ? Dogs do n't usually roam around neighborhoods ... Unless they 're with people . But squirrels ... I 'm not seeing any squirrels . I do n't know . I do n't know , shane . Hey , where did you find those ? In a shoe box underneath the bed . Oh . Oh . So , what do you want to do ... cut each strip in half ? Two pictures each ? ( SIGHS ) No . You can keep them . You do n't have a subscription to your satellite radio ?
zone3	lapse . You did ? Yeah . I 've just been listening to my iPod and podcasting . - You only have satellite radio ? - Yeah . Paid extra for it . You paid extra for less features ? That guy at stereo town totally swindled me . Told you not to go to stereo town . - It 's close . - You went to stereo town ? How long would it take for a full-blown mutation to occur ? A mutation of what ? - Human beings . - Never . No , um ... no , no . Mutation . Mutation mutation . Okay , now you 're just repeating the same word . Nuclear mutation . Assuming the debris was radioactive , Exposure to the fallout would only cause D.N.A . Mutations ... In inherited genes , So only children of those exposed would be affected . In which case , the deformities would be horrific . But , no , they would n't be mutants . I do n't think you understand what I 'm asking . I 'll just explain it later .
zone3	. No , but I get ... hey , duct tape . Did you say duct tape or duck tape ? What ? Duct tape . With a " t " ? Yeah . Holy shit . Am I the only person that does n't know this ? Everyone focus up here , all right ? No dice on the radio . So I think we should seal up all the cracks in the house . No outside air should get in at all . Right , Hedy ? Well , there 's only one roll . One-man job , so ... Uh , oh . I 'll ... I 'll do it . Good man , glennzo . - We should close up all the air vents too . - I was just about to say that . Buck , you mind taking care of that ? You 're the tallest . I 'm on it , boss . LEXI : Guess what ? Everyone , I have a surprise . Come with me . ( **26;2537;TOOLONG ) No , guys , I 'm actually serious . I found

I forgot about that . - A monkey ? - No , no . It 's a radio . - I just ... it hit me . I remembered singing in the shower here to " louie louie " once . - Nice sense memory . - Gracias . Wait . What did you just say ? - Gracias . - No , you said you remember ... Singing in the shower here to " louie louie " once . - Yeah . - When ? - What ? - When did you take a shower here ? It was a long time ago . No , I 'm sorry . Let me rephrase the question , Lexi . Why did you take a shower here ? Pete ? You want to help Lexi out with this question ? Okay
zone3	right now . That 's exactly what the enemy wants . I 'm in agreement . What 's everybody doing ... is that a radio ? Have you tried it ? EMMA : Not yet . Why not ? ' cause I just found out ... That my husband is fucking my best friend . Best friend ? Okay , let 's put a pin in that for now , why do n't we , And find out if this works and if we 're gon na live or d ... ( RADIOCLICKSON , STATIC ) Oh , thank god it works . ( STATICCONTINUES ) ( STATIC ) WOMAN : One , seven , nine , one , One , eight , eight , two ... It 's like lost . Shh ! ...

We need to get the fuck outta here . What part of " stay in your homes " do you not understand ? This is n't my home . We can take up the semantics of possessive pronouns next week . First of all , we do n't even know if that signal was from our side . Four to five days . Do you know how long that is ? Yes . If we stay in here for four to five days , We are giving everyone else a head start ... To go out and form motorcycle gangs , loot and pillage . All the good canned goods and shotguns . We 're gon na go out . All we 're gon na find is refried beans and motor scooters . I liked motor scooters . Oh , shut up . HEDY : Hey !
zone3	Hedy . Help yourself . Hedy . ( CONTINUES , INDISTINCT ) Hedy , Hedy , Hedy . Okay , we need to make a plan . A plan ? Yeah , yeah . Me and you ... that 's all that matters right now . Tracy could be an asset ' cause she 's a doctor . And maybe Buck knows how to work a rifle . But I do n't know if that 's just some mental association I 'm making ... Because his name is Buck . Do have a rifle ? No , no . We 're gon na get one . There 's a guns-and-ammo store down at Duvall Street right by the toby . Oh , yeah . I love that place . I know . I know . It 's great . Right now , we need to make a break for the car and hightail it outta here . My uncle has that cabin in ... I 'm gon na ... I 'm gon na go get a drink . I 'm gon na go get a drink . That 's my

You know , I actually used to work ... At an air-conditioning place in high school . And get this . The guy who ran the place was named A.C . ( CHUCKLING ) A.C . Ran and A.C . Shop . Do you think that when we die , We have to wear the clothes we died in for all of eternity ? No way . I bet we get those kicking ' white robes ... Like you see in the old cartoons . I look awful in white . Maybe Emma would let me borrow some sweats . I bet you get a sweet-ass harp too . ( SIRENSCONTINUE , LOUDER ) Hmm . ( LAUGHS ) Do you have any idea how many human beings ... Are estimated to have lived and died on earth ... Throughout all of time ? I have absolutely no idea
zone3	you 're saying is that when we die , We 're going to a place where 106 billion people ... Are sitting around playing the harp . That would be really fucking annoying . Well , maybe heaven is what you make it in your mind . No . ( ? COUNTRYROCK ) - Can I come in ? - No . I wan na talk about this . I do n't . Please , can I come in ? No . It did n't mean anything , emmers . It happened after we 'd already decided to go through with the divorce . - I thought it was over . - It is over . And it does n't make it okay . ( **28;2565;TOOLONG ) ( HELICOPTERAPPROACHING ) ( GLASSRATTLING ) SHANE : I ca n't see anything . It 's probably helicopters . Yeah , but are they ours or theirs ?

And in this case , the cat died a slow and painful death from radiation poisoning . ( KNOCKING ) WOMAN : Hello ? - Gordon and jenny . - Jenny and gordon . Oh ! ( GASPS ) Oh , shit . They look terrible . I like jenny 's jacket though . Hey , jenny ! I like your jacket ! Thanks . Hey , uh , could you guys let us in ? What 's going on out there ? It 's bad . It 's real bad . Can you be more specific ? ( EXHALES ) I 've seen things . Could you maybe name one thing ? ( COUGHING ) Look , Gordon is n't doing so well . Do you think you could let us in , please ? Um , actually we ca n't ... ' cause we already duct-taped the door .
zone3	if we let you guys in , you 'll infect us all , so ... I 'm a doctor . I do n't make this shit up . ( COUGHING ) We 're not gon na last out here . Well , maybe you should learn to show up to things on time . - Huh ? - Is that what this is about ? Every brunch , jenny . Every brunch . It 's just really inconsiderate . We really tried to make it here on time . No , you did n't . You did n't think about punctuality ... Or how it affects other people 's lives . Some people make dishes that are hot ... And meant to be served ... At the designated eating time agreed upon . You 're still mad about that thing with claudio , are n't you ? Let 's not rehash old wounds , jenny . You 've got much bigger problems now . It was new year 's eve , tracy . It just happened . Who ... who is claudio ? ( THUD , GROAN ) Open the
zone3	. That was some cold shit , tracy . Yeah . Was it ? I thought it was kind of harsh . No . It 's us or them . And judging by their rapid cellular deterioration , The toxicity level must be pretty dense and fast acting . But radiation usually takes weeks to ... It 's not radiation . The emergency broadcast said V.X . As in V.X . Nerve gas . As in ... The most toxic chemical weapon ever synthesized . ( CRUNCHING ) That 's not good , is it ? No . It 's not good . SHANE : Holy shit . That 's the stuff from iraq . Well , babe , what does this mean for us ? It means we 're all gon na be dead ... In , like , three hours . What 'd I miss ?

I used to do it with you . - No , we 'll do it together again . - Can you hold it down , Danny ? You see what you 're starting , Dad ? You 're starting a whole argument . Dean , listen , do n't worry about nothing . So I think there was also a paternal transference there too . H-hello . I-I 'm Jerry Lewis , the new busboy . I 'm Dean Martin , the old waiter . Oh . It 's a small world , ai n't it ? It 's a little too small . Let 's get out of here . All right . Jerry Lewis : I think people were frightened over homosexual probabilities . They did n't want to
zone3	, like a man and a woman , a wife and a daughter , a son or husband . - Why do n't you take your clothes off ? - Here , I do n't even know you . Richard Belzer : They came along at a time right after World War II . No one was ever that anarchic ... - What 's the matter ? - Flood . ... and that physically attractive , that young , that dangerous . - Get off the stage ! - Look , I do n't mind in a room with the whips and the chains , but not in front of the audience . Get off the stage . It was the ' 50s . It 's a very ... you know , after the war , it 's a very conservative time . But what came about was this kind of anarchy . You know , you had rock ' n ' roll . You 're laughing . You forgot to take your watch off . ( laughter ) So Martin and Lewis are , I believe , part of
zone3	of anarchy . - You 're all mine ! ( laughing ) - You 're overactive , Jerry . The secret was , of course , that the audience was in on it . They were being naughty too . They redefined the nature of show business , which is pretty amazing when you ... you know , it 's pretty astounding stuff . Jerry Lewis : Very unbelievable ... the things that happened to us . In a matter of six months we went from making $450 a week ... we were getting $20,000 a week . People in our business ... their heads were turning all the time , " What ? How much ? What ? What did they do ? I do n't know , but they 're hotter than we will ever be . And they 're getting all of the money there is in the world . " And we 're reading in every paper and seeing on ever television program and hearing people talking about what we were doing and carrying on . We were very excited and very proud . I do
zone3	, but it was fun . ( playingintro ) ## Just remember ... ## Crystal : When Jerry was onstage with Dean , something really special happened . They were amazing together . And it just looked like fun . Straight men are very rare . The great one's ... you can think of Carl Reiner with Mel , and Dean . He was different . He was charming . He was funny . He could act . He could seriously act . He was unselfish . He sang great . And they made each other great . Stand up . Take a bow . Do n't be shy . Hey ! Hey , lady ! Lady ! ( grunts , screams ) Richard Lewis : It 's like you were born and all of a sudden you 're watching a Martin and Lewis film . And it 's like I figured he was just part of the earth , you know , one of the essential things to know about . Crystal : They were the biggest stars in the world as a comedy team . When does that
zone3	five , six shows a day was unheard of . We love you all and we hope we can see you at the Paramount July 4th for two weeks . - Good night . God bless you all . - Good night . Goodbye . Jerry Lewis : We did two weeks , eight shows a day , 56 shows a week . We made $600,000 , ' cause we got 90% of the tickets and the theater got 10% . In order for me to get them out of the audience so that we could fill up the theater again , I would say , " If you come backstage , we 're gon na have pictures for you . " And as we left the stage , you saw 4000 people exit the theater . And they did that three or four times in a day , so you wind up with , like , 16,000 or 20,000 people out there . - ( crowdscreaming ) - And it was mass chaos all through Times Square right down to 9th Avenue . The mayor of the city came
zone3	said to him , " Well , we could just close tonight . We could go away . " He said , " No , no , no , no , no . No , it 's good for the city . " Eddie Murphy : When they blew up , it was very much like the Beatles or like Sinatra and Elvis . Thousands of people in the street ... looks like it 's New Year 's Eve , you know , and it 's just that they 're playing a gig in town . They 're the first big rock star . There was no rock star back then when they came out , but they had rock star popularity . Burnett : I was just starting high school when Jerry and Dean came along . It was explosive . And I 'd be the first in line to see one of their movies when it opened . Richard Lewis : You ca n't get bigger than this and for all the right reasons . He ripped people 's brains out . He ripped them to shreds .
zone3	) We ai n't got any ! Jerry Lewis : The pandemonium that it caused was exactly what happened with the Beatles later on . It was incredible . Every once in a while I look on the stage to see where he would be . He 's not there anymore . So I think about the great times we had . He would walk in front of an audience and , before he sang a note , he would say to them , " I want all of you people here tonight that do not drink , I want you to know that tomorrow when you get up , that 's as good as you 're gon na feel all day . " ( laughter ) - Can I ask you a question ? - Yes . - Are you looking at me ? - Yes . - I 'm over here . - Oh , hello there , Jerry . You would n't mind breathing out that way once or twice , would you ? ( blowsair ) Jerry Lewis : I used to tease him over the
zone3	getting down or depressed ... " Upright . " " Oh , yeah , okay . " It worked . Chevy Chase : But I always wondered what happened after that breakup . Obviously Dean went on ' cause he had that great hair and was very , very funny and a , you know , great talent . July 25th ... I think a lot . That was the night we teamed up ... July 25th , 1946 . And we split July 25th , 1956 ... 10 years to the day . There 's no way to explain what I felt . And I said goodbye , and he said goodbye . Then the work goes on and on and on . Alec Baldwin : I guess it was just destiny that it was n't gon na last very long and that Lewis had to go off and do his own thing . Not that he did n't need Martin , but there was just a whole other thing he needed to do . Deana Martin : They had their thing together . They had their time .
zone3	to do something again , because it was just perfect the way it was . And then we can just admire them for who they became . Seinfeld : Jerry and Dean deciding to end when they were still legends , as opposed to when it was starting to fray ... I wanted that too for my Tv series . I wanted to make sure that I just went out before ... a moment before and not the moment after . Do you still think about Dean at night ? There is n't a day in my life that I do n't think of my partner , - not a day . - ( applause ) Never . I do n't have any qualms about proclaiming the love I had for my partner . Every time I walk on a stage , I know it 's because of him and what he did to get me there . It 's a constant appreciation and a gratitude to a man that I ca n't communicate with , but I just hope he is peeking and listening and knowing how much I
zone3	) When you understand what it was that people saw and felt ... they saw a love affair between two men and they were coming out to make money doing it . And they were having a wonderful time . And audiences could n't believe the fun they were having . That was the mystery of it . Martin : Let 's do an old thing we used to do in the old act . All right , that 's fine with me . You 'll never have an ar ... you never , with me , an argument , at no time . - Never ? - Never . - Promise ? - Word . - Let 's have lunch someday . - Give me a ring . I 'm in the book . - All right . - All right . We sure created something . And we made it work and had a ball for 10 years , never to be duplicated by any couple of anything , ever .

zone3	cheering_and_applause ) Oh , he sings great . Jerry sings great . ( orchestraplayingjazz ) Talent ... he 's just got it in his pores , all kinds of talent . Then I could do a number . My hit record ... would anyone like to see that ? Jerry Lewis : I did a record . All it did was 7 million copies
zone3	now . It 's a good feeling too . ( orchestrastops ) You got ta go until I sing . Stay with it . Do n't be afraid . - Oh , just stay with the theme ? - Stay there . I got you . Okay . One more time , please . Dean you 're not , but you will do . ( laughter ) - ( orchestraplaying ) - From a film that I 'm very proud of , circa 1963 , we do the hit song from " The Nutty Professor . " - (

You know , that 's the kind of performer he is . ( recordingplaying ) ## Be my life ## ## For no one else can end ## ## This yearning ... ## Crystal : A lot of comics were doing record lip-syncing , but his was different . He was n't just lip-syncing " Mule Train " or one of those things . He was interpreting music . ## There 'll be no one but you ## ## For me ## ## Eternally ... ## It was as special a kind of skill in its own way as Chaplin bouncing the ball in " The Great Dictator . " It 's playing with something and giving it a different life . ## Be
zone3	my career . ( chuckles ) ## Here 's what you 'll be saying ## ## When you are far from home ... ## Chris Lewis : My dad 's got Al Jolson 's original charts that he gave him , on his shelf in his office in vegas . It 's Jolson 's music and he gave it to my dad ' cause he knew my dad idolized him . ## The sun shines east , the sun shines west ## ## I just learned where the sun shines best ... ## ( bothhummingatune ) Right there , that 's a ... That 's it . You got it . And then the answers will be in that new , slower ... uh ! Yeah , yeah , but then it 's in that ... uh ! - It 's in the new tempo . - Uh !

And the flight attendant is checking to see if people would like a drink after take-off . She approached the rabbi first . " Rabbi , may I get you a drink after take-off ? " He said , " I 'd like a tall scotch and soda with a twist . " She said , " Fine . " Then she approached the priest , " Father , may I give you a drink after take-off ? " He said , " Young lady , before I would allow alcohol to pass through these lips , I would rather commit adultery . " The rabbi said , " Hold my order . I did n't know we had a choice . " ( laughter ) Let me have

And I watch it all night . People are watching television ... I 'm watching my Academy Award . ( chuckles ) Why not ? See , I have an infinite love of my industry . Film is part of my blood . ( narrating ) Dean 's and my first film ... I had to just ask questions . I did n't stop . They could n't find me on the lot . I was either in miniatures , camera department , wardrobe , editing , the scoring stage . I was like horseshit . I was everywhere . Oh , you 're scared also ? ( narrating ) And I was getting an education . There was nothing about our industry that I did n't make up my mind I was gon na learn . And I did n't know at the time why I needed
zone3	na turn it into pay dirt . They said that ... what ? I turned down Metro , 20th , Universal , Sam Goldwyn , and went with Paramount . Well , I do n't care really about the hours or money . - Good . You 're hired . - Oh . When you 're that guy and you have that kind of career , everybody wants to work with you . - There 'll be lots of extras ... - Yeah . They 're sending you all the scripts and you 've got all the directors want to work with you and all the studios want to throw money at you . All the beautiful dames you 'll be with ... Oh , mwah . - Sharp cars ... - ( mimicsengine ) Well , Lewis is that perfect intersection of some great movie career where you 've got the goods and audiences love what you do and , you know , you just strike gold . - We pay all expenses . - Oh ! Jerry Lewis : Every time I created a film , I generated
zone3	They had hoped for it , and it was there every time . I stayed with Paramount for $800 million in ticket rentals . That 's when the movies were 25 cents apiece . Crystal : People who are not historians do n't realize how powerful he was at such a young age . Well , he was directing and starring and writing his own movies . And he was the biggest star in the world for years . Richard Lewis : He brought families together . The four-year-old would laugh . The 40-year-old would laugh . The grandfather would laugh . It 's hard to do that . It 's hard to do that . He did that . Jerry Lewis : Adolph Zukor used to call from New York to the West Coast office of Paramount and say , " I 'm just calling to tell you to keep him warm . Keep him warm . " Someone asked Barney Balaban how he gets along with Jerry Lewis . He said , " Great . If he wants to burn down the studio , I 'll give him
zone3	the morning and say , " Dad gave me this studio . " - (
zone3	honks_horn ) - You know , I 'd drive in and start playing around . He did n't abuse the right to have the keys to the studio . He made real cutting-edge comedies . Jerry was truly an artist . I 'm DOA Bird , producer of fine films . That 's right . And if I may , I would like very much for some of you folk out there to meet some of the people that are to blame for ... I 'm sorry , I mean , that are responsible for this film . Someone gave me a hat with four beaks . This one was the director ... Shh , swine , ca n't you see I 'm creating ? Oh , it 's you , Mr . Bird . It 's a pleasure to have you on the set . ( clicksheels ) Oh , I broke both my ... - Producer ... - Oh , they 're all strange . - Writer ... - Hel ... hello ,
zone3	you , great producer . Actor . They wanted to talk to me ... they 'd switch the hat around . Here is our star ... the man who will deliver us from Tv and once again having the theaters bursting with laughter ... Jerry Lewis . ( snickers ) Quentin Tarantino : It always really is exciting when a performer feels compelled to move into filmmaking and go even further with their art . Jerry Lewis : My impression of your everyday , run-of-the-mill , basic , ordinary , simple drunk . ( scatteredlaughter ) The same drunk in an earthquake . (
zone3	laughter_and_applause ) What a stupid way to make a fortune . (
zone3	cheering_and_applause ) Announcer : Paramount Studios announces an unprecedented $10 million pact with Jerry Lewis . Such excitement over a piece of paper has not been experienced by the world since the League of Nations Covenant was rejected by the Congress of the United States of America . Chris Lewis : My dad did make a deal with Paramount . He signed a $10 million deal with Paramount in ' 59 . And at
zone3	all of the rights would revert back to him , because they wanted him so badly . Crystal : Here came this big noise . What was that ? He had a different magnetism and a different energy than anyone onscreen had at that time . Jerry Lewis : " Cinderfella " was made for family . And I built the entire marketing campaign on that , because the film that I was doing was so special . I went to Rockwell and asked him if he would do it . I wanted the best . I have the only Rockwell ever commissioned to be the advertisement of a motion picture . Hey , mister , you got that all wrong . How ? You forgot the most important letter ... the F . Whoa . Whoa . His comedies , you know ... he was very specific about when they came out ... you know , a summer picture and then a Christmas picture . Jerry Lewis : And I would n't let the studio release the picture - until it was holiday time . - (
zone3	crowd_gasps )
zone3	it as a Christmas release . " - Man : But , chief ... - But nothing . You sell ' em and I 'll make ' em . Now for the Christmas campaign I 'm gon na make a real kids ' picture with big names . - Okay , chief . - And when you talk to New York , you tell them I said ... I 'll do anything they say . Jerry Lewis : And Paramount was at a point where if they did n't have a Jerry Lewis movie in the summer , they 're blowing a lot of money . So I said to Barney Balaban , " I 'll give you a Jerry Lewis movie . " I go to Florida and I wrote a 165-page screenplay in nine days . And I was shooting on the 14th day . Jerry , can we play that " Bellboy " theme ? - I 'm waiting to hear it . - A-one , two , three , four ... ( playing " Bellboy " theme ) Jerry wrote the theme from the " Bellboy
zone3	the funny note at the top . ( humstheme ) - That 's what ... that 's ... - ( laughter ) Jerry Lewis : When I left New York to open at the Fontainebleau , I had this short amount of time . I had a clock by my typewriter that was noisy . ( imitatesclockticking ) And every tick I heard was getting me closer to , " Jesus Christ , you big mouth , how did you get yourself into this ? " ( laughs ) And I 'm reviewing what I 'm writing ... " Oh , it 'll be okay . I 'll write some more . " I finished the script before I finished my engagement . I was only there for two weeks . The motion picture you 're about to see is n't the run-of-the-mill film fare that has been presented to the moviegoing public of late . There is no story and no plot . It is a visual diary of a few weeks in the life of a real nut . Jerry Lewis : I went to Billy Wilder and
zone3	read " The Bellboy " and he came back to me and he said , " Goddamn wonderful . It 's wonderful . ( imitatesaccent ) I ca n't wait to see it on the screen . It 's terrific . " I said , " Well , I want you to direct it . " He said , " Are you crazy ? I would n't direct you . Are you nuts ? You do it . It 's your baby . You wrote it . Direct it . You 'll get what you want that way . " I said , " Okay . " I had n't thought about that . But then I closed at the Fontainebleau , then I got it done in 48 days . I go and I open at the Sands in vegas ... another commitment that I had to honor . So I was cutting the picture down in the musicians ' room in the basement , at the Sands , and delivered it to Paramount ... - Hold it . ... in less than 20 weeks . - Who are
zone3	, chief . Mm-hmm , and who 's the guy with the straw hat ? He 's the guy that tells you who we are . Jerry Lewis : I 'd never had such a good time . I was getting stronger in my convictions of what I was printing . I was getting stronger about my ability . I 've never seen you laugh so hard . I 've got Stanley on theater seating duty . Alone ? How long has he been in there ? I just sent him in . He 'll be in here for two , three days at least . - Let 's go and watch . - Okay . ( doorrattles ) ( whistling " Bellboy " theme ) He 's fast . Jerry Lewis : The night that I finished the first shoot day , I called my dad . He said , " How did it go ? " And I said , " Dad , I ca n't believe I did the things I did n't know I knew and it worked . " He said , " Stay there
zone3	. " " Okay . " It was an extraordinary time . It 's like that one time in your lifetime that something like that 's gon na work or that you 're gon na even attempt it . There you are , Stanley . Get everything out of the trunk . And Paramount turned chicken when they read the screenplay . And they thought I was doing a silent movie . I said , " It 's not a silent movie . A lot of noise in this movie . The kid just does n't talk . " I said , " You do n't have to go with me . Stay out of it ... " (
zone3	phone_ringing ) " ... and I will produce the film . " ( phonestopsringing ) " But it will be my negative . " " Great . " They were thrilled . - ( whistlingtune ) - (
zone3	phone_ringing ) ( phonecontinuesringing ) ( phonestopsringing ) Jerry Lewis : $975,000 later ... - (
zone3	phone_rings ) ... I cut negative . (
zone3	phone_ringing ) - ( phonestopsringing ) - To date
zone3	million . (
zone3	phone_ringing ) - ( phonestopsringing ) - And they were not participating . Belzer : He wrote " The Bellboy " and paid for it himself and shot this masterpiece where he does n't speak until the last minute of the movie . How is it we never heard you talk before ? Because no one ever asked me . Jerry Lewis : Nobody believed I could pull it off in the first place . Nowadays if they hear the word " Bellboy , " they puke right in the hall , on the rug ... " Bleh ! " Because there 's no telling what it 's gon na continue to make for years on end . When you got a good negative , it 's forever . A woman goes to the doctor for an exam . A woman goes to the doctor for an exam . She comes home . She 's flitting around the house from room to room with an energy level unlike anything the husband had ever seen . He finally stops her . He says , " Honey , would
zone3	you 're so happy about ? " She said , " Sweetheart , you know what the doctor said to me today ? He said I had the breasts of an 18-year-old . " He said , " Really ? What did he say about your 45-year-old ass ? " (
zone3	laughter_and_applause ) She said , " Your name never came up . " (
zone3	laughter_and_applause ) Oh ! Oh ! Listen to the women ... " No ! " Jerry refers to himself in different ways . He calls himself Jerry or " the kid " or " the idiot , " because he has to know which Jerry he 's playing in different scenes . And I had a similar thing on my show where I had ... was Jerry and Tv Jerry . Crystal : Directing yourself in your own movie that you 've written and you 've crafted a character for yourself is so hard . Man : 51-2 . Crystal : If you have a vision for something and he knows who he is , and it sometimes is hard for someone else to get
zone3	yourself . Well , just do n't do something . Sit there . Uh , that is ... class dismissed ! Tarantino : And it was n't just , " Let me do it because I 'm tired of listening to that hack , " all right , or , " Well , if that guy can do it , I can do it . " You know , he did n't come from that place . He wanted his films to be terrific . And he wanted to be considered a serious director who did comedy . He is much closer to Buster Keaton than Charlie Chaplin , insofar as actually taking the film medium and trying to get laughs by the way you shot stuff , by the art form itself ... - ( whistlingatune ) ... not just the pratfalls , not just " filming my comedy , " but the comedy is also part of the filmmaking process itself . (
zone3	camera_shutter_clicks ) (
zone3	birds_chirping ) Steven Spielberg : He was a restless filmmaker , you know . He was always searching . He was ,
zone3	telling a story , you know . He was trying to , I think , almost redefine the art of the narrative . The Marx Brothers , when they had the right writer and the right director and all the pieces were in place , they made great movies . Man : 490 , take 4 . ( knocks ) - Yes ? - ( laughs ) But Jerry made them himself . He did it all himself . So that 's a very different thing . I have always been so intrigued with what we are capable of doing technically . Richard Lewis : Jerry is a genius . He invented unbelievable things as a director that people use to this day . Every time a director takes a shot and then runs over and looks at it , it 's Jerry . Oh ! Jerry Lewis : I had nightmares thinking how much I 've learned in the picture industry , and what do I do if I want to direct Jerry ? ( mumbles ) I do n't know that . Jerry Lewis : What do I
zone3	camera operator ? Suffuse his sense of humor to the way that it must be , to print or dump ? What do I do ? I decided that if I was gon na direct Jerry , the only time I would ever print would be if I saw what he did . In the picture business we have wires that usually hold . - ( womangiggling ) - Unfortunately this goddamn thing broke . Cut . He is the performer . Jerry 's not only writing , producing , directing , God knows , painting the sets , whatever the hell he 's doing , you know . You understand why he created video assist ... because he 's the performer . What about if you had a video camera alongside your B and C and you keep your monitor where you can see it ? Because there was n't tape then . Murphy : Video playback changed all of filmmaking . This guy said , " Hey , wait a minute . Let me see right on the set what we just shot . " I do n't
zone3	at the monitor and go , " Can I get another one ? Can we do one more ? " Jerry Lewis : I go to Tokyo and I sat with Mr . Morita ... the chairman of the board of the Sony Corporation , with his research people . And they 're all drawing me sketches . Shipped everything back from Tokyo with me and I called the crew and we set up everything . It was magic . Spielberg : The video assist was invented by Jerry because nobody had any idea what they were getting until the operator blessed it or until the operator critiqued it . Jerry Lewis : So it became a great tool for my wardrobe , makeup , grips , electricians . The camera operator loved seeing what he had just finished setting up . Spielberg : The camera operator was in collaboration for the first time with the filmmaker , with the director himself . And now the operator and the director could figure out how to tweak the shot , make it better . That 's genius . But it also
zone3	! ... ' cause he could see it right there . I directed Jerry Lewis in " Mr . Saturday Night . " He came on the set . He saw the video assist . He told me , " I invented that . " I said , " But you did n't have playback . You just could watch . " And he went , " Details , details . " Jerry Lewis : And then a year later I get video tape . Spielberg : There should be a sign , you know , saying ... ( laughing ) " Jerry Lewis invented this . " Jerry Lewis : I learned from Joe Mankiewicz ... " You will be a great director the day you understand you have to create an atmosphere of fun . You will get people skipping to work in the morning . " - ## I love you , I love you . ## - ( laughing ) ## You 're Jewish and I 'm gay . ## ( crewlaughing ) One picture of the family . Hold it . - ( laughinglouder )

" Belzer : The fact that it says " Open " shows how fearless , how gracious ... " This is what I do . Come and look at it . I 'm proud of it . " - Jerry Lewis : I 'm going to work . - Man : All right , places , please . Jerry Lewis : All right , let 's hear it for the movie star . - Jerry Lewis : Hey , stupid ! - Crew : Hey ! My name is on the screen . I get the credit for all . But everyone on my crew was a teacher in one way or another . I 've worked very hard to let them always remember that I could n't do any of the stuff I did without them . Burnett : He was a guest star on my show . He knew everybody 's name on our crew . Once he was
zone3	Hello , Morty . - Hello , Mr . Habanaffen . May I help you ? A lot of people have difficulty with that . - It 's Wo ... - Wo ben ... ... ben lot ... ... lot ny . ... ny . - Wobenlotny . - Babanotten . John Landis : I did a series of commercials for Coca-Cola with Jerry Lewis in the early ' 90s . He shows up , 8:00 in the morning , and he was introduced to every single individual there . Had to be 70 people . And then we shot . At the end of the day he wanted everyone 's attention . And everyone looks and he says , " Listen , I 'd like to say good night , Bob , good night , Larry , good night , Gloria , good night , Shirley , good night ... " Every single person 's name ... he knew their names . And so he went out in this blaze of glory and everybody was like , " Wow ! " I got two sets of bleachers on my
zone3	loved it . They were as big a ham as I am . They had fun watching me as the director . - ( playsachord ) - ( singsoff-key , laughing ) Then they had fun watching me as the comic . ( laughing ) Cut . They 'd see me run into myself . - ( laughing ) - Cut . It 's a challenge , when you 're feeling all of this power that you have to have and delegate to the right people , to keep yourself calm to give a performance . Woody Harrelson : The camaraderie had to be important for him just to be able to feel like he could just let go and do some of that wild insanity that he would ... he 'd come up with just the most ... ( truckhornblows ) Argh ! You have to feel safe to be able to do that . ( crewlaughing ) Son of a bitch . Will you leave me alone ? It just seemed like the most fun you could have ... in the ' 60s at Paramount , doing his
zone3	read in the paper that a motion picture advertiser needed help . ( sighs ) - Do you have to go to the toilet ? - ( crewsnickering ) - No . - No ? - I 'm just fine . - ( laughter ) All right , cut . I have to tell you this because I ca n't keep it to myself any longer . I was in New York three weeks ago , could n't get a cab . It was raining . So I go downstairs to the subway and I get on the train . I 'm sitting there and it makes one stop . And this guy gets on wearing leather pants , leather jacket , leather shirt , leather tie , leather boots . And he had rings on his ears , on his nose , on his lip . And he had his hair swiped up yellow , red , green , purple . And he sits down right opposite me . And I 'm staring at him . He says , " What 's the matter , old man ? Did
zone3	said , " Yeah , about 20 years ago I had sex with a parrot . I thought you were my son . " (
zone3	laughter_and_applause ) This is just another thing of his amazing eye . ( explosion ) Man : Get the door ! (
zone3	door_squeaks ) Seinfeld : When he gets called into the dean 's office as Professor Kelp after the explosion and he sits down in that chair and sinks into it ... to have the eye to know , " This will look funny . " He 's not doing anything . He 's just sinking in a chair . It 's brilliant . It 's so funny . It 's so simple . When I first started watching it , I just know , " This guy is making me laugh every time I see him . " And now , having done a few things myself , I understand a lot more and I appreciate the incredible richness of his skills even more . Look at the headline of the column . - Are you in focus ? - Man : I
zone3	of stuff to be in focus . ( laughing ) The thrill of getting an idea and then sketching it and then sitting behind a camera , and you 're looking and you see it 's exact , let 's shoot it ... it 's a rush . You want to do it some more . ( jazzorchestraplaying ) I wanted to see the kid - in a boardinghouse . - ( knocks ) Well , when you start with an idea like this , it just blooms . So I built this set . And it cost me almost a half a million to build it . We 're talking about 1960 . All my sound ... everything was in the ceilings . - Man : Let 's try to get a microphone ... - One , two , three , four ... Jerry Lewis : I had three mixers on the set to cover the 42 rooms . Spielberg : Those humongous sets on " Ladies ' Man , " in a sense , rivaling " The Diary of Anne Frank " set and " The Rear Window
zone3	all there . It was all there for a filmmaker to make choices . Just pull back ... you had it all right before your lens . They asked me if I would want to teach a class at USC . And I thought that sounded terrific . And I went for it . And I had eight magnificent years teaching post-grad students . He believed in young people . And he believed in a whole new generation of filmmakers coming up . And he had a class . For young filmmakers . And I had made " Amblin " ' ... my short film . And he invited me to show the film to the class and to speak about my process . In my case , being a fan of Jerry 's , almost feeling like pinching myself ... I ca n't believe I 'm in the same room and Jerry Lewis is actually having a conversation with me . Jerry Lewis : Spielberg was in that class . - Bogdanovich . - Bogdanovich was in the class , Randy Kleiser . He was warm . He was
zone3	When he taught at USC and we were in his class , he recorded those classes , which ultimately became the book " The Total Film-Maker . " Jerry Lewis : Marty Scorsese never went on the set without the book . I would argue with him about something , he said , " Hold on a second . " So he 'd lean over and he 'd turn pages in my book . Spielberg : And he loved those kids . I mentor now to this day . Jerry Lewis taught me the importance of mentoring . Harrelson : The main reason I 'm a performer is because of Jerry . He speaks to the common man . All I wanted to do is apologize to you , see ? Will you get out of here ? If you do n't , I 'm gon na ... - Argh ! - Oh , wait , my foot . - My foot is stuck . - Get out of here . Harrelson : You love him . You root for him ... the , " Oh , no , not

zone3	woman_screams ) Here , let me cover you up . ( babbling ) (
zone3	woman_screaming ) Get me out of here ! ( orchestraplayingjazz ) - ( orchestrastops ) - ( laughter ) I dug the ' 60s comic books when I was a kid . I thought they were great . His comic books rocked . His comic books were made better than Bob Hope 's . I just got ta say that . I know it 's controversial . ( laughter ) But Jerry did the better comic than Bob Hope . Jerry Lewis : Oh , Jesus . - ( Tarantinolaughing ) He just spit on the American flag . Tarantino : Well , I remember one of Truffaut 's quotes : Jerry Lewis is almost like a whole year 's worth of cartoons in one performance . Jerry 's comedy existed in the world where cartoons already existed . Jerry Lewis is kind of like a cartoon figure . (
zone3	laughter_and_applause ) ( cheering ) He was a kid . I mean , I loved the cartoon gags . Whoa ! There
zone3	) ( roars ) My God , that 's just what I did all the time as a kid ... you know , making faces . There was nobody better at it than him . ( giggling ) (
zone3	cheering_and_applause ) Jerry went back to the silent era and he brought visual sight gags back to American movie theaters . They were n't doing that for a long time . Long before the Zuckers did " Airplane ! " Which I think owes a lot to Jerry Lewis movies , and before those great visual comedies ... you know , like all the Leslie Nielsen comedies . You have to look at Jerry . He 's kind of the father of that style of gags . Oh ! (
zone3	cheering_and_applause ) I 've always thought that there was a connection between Jerry Lewis and Bugs Bunny a little bit , but one of the biggest connections is , when Bugs Bunny would get dressed up as a woman , well , that 's pretty much like when Jerry Lewis got dressed up as Carmen Miranda , all right ? (
zone3	is they actually go for sex appeal . He looks like a girl . Tarantino : " Looney Tunes " would constantly break the fourth wall and talk to somebody in the theater ... " Hey , you in the third row , shut up . " Over here . Let 's not fool with the child star . Tarantino : The end of " Patsy " when he falls ... - Whoa ! - Stanley ! Tarantino : It 's a perfect example of a " Looney Tunes , " break the fourth wall ... this is what we 're watching , in fact , and why are you watching it ? ( laughs ) Stanley . Are n't you overacting a little bit , Miss Balin ? Balin . It 's a movie , see ? I 'm fine . The people in the theater know I ai n't gon na die . Here , it 's a movie stage . Here , look at this , see ? There 's wires and lights . And I 'm gon na make more movies , so I could n't
zone3	a dumb city . Tarantino : That 's still kind of a bizarre joke today . It 's out there . You are a complete nut . Which reminds me , I 'm having nuts and whipped cream for lunch . Would you join me , please ? Crew , that 's lunch . One hour for the actors and seven days for the technicians . It 's a movie set breaking once and for all ... ( wheezing , mutters ) Jerry Lewis : There 's a lot of resilience in a director . He can take a lot of crap . It 's too heavy . You 'd better cut it , Lenny . ( crewlaughing ) Jerry Lewis : What he has to exude for the actors is solid confidence that he knows the way you 're gon na cut it , and the director is gon na tell you . When you make a set-up , know where it 's coming from , to there , and where that 's going , to there . The captain of the National Airlines jet just flew in from
zone3	of the plane . - Now get down there and get it . - (
zone3	tires_screech ) Jerry Lewis : In " The Bellboy , " when I had him drive to the airport , go into the airport , walk up the steps , he 's looking for the captain 's briefcase ... did n't have to say anything ; did n't have to do anything ; music was n't even important . Oh , Stanley ? Yes , he works for me . He what ? (
zone3	engine_roaring ) The fact that it was on the cut : " He what ? " Bang ! He 's up there at 7,000 feet . I recut it 13 times , always coming back to the original thought ... chick-choo , chick-choo , chick-choo . You take a beat between " chick " ... you ca n't do that . Man : Would you say something into the microphone for me ? - Jerry Lewis : Now ? - Okay . ( loudly ) How 's it going ? Geronimo ! Jerry Lewis : The creative mind needs sound and
zone3	as vitally important as the picture . ( footstepssqueaking ) ( footstepssqueaking ) (
zone3	school_bell_rings ) Jerry Lewis : He comes in . We see that he 's just blotto . It 's the hangover of the century . I used the slam of a safe door . ( loudbong ) Oh . Jerry Lewis : And I went to the Bank of America to shoot it . And we recorded the ... bo-o-ong ! And I had the mike on the inner door , so you really heard what nobody ever heard . ( booms ) No one 's ever been in there when they did that . ( squeaking ) Jerry Lewis : Chalk on the board ... it bothered me watching it . Oh . ( chewingloudly ) ( sneezes ) The sneeze . ( loudnoise ) Jerry Lewis : I used a grizzly bear 's growl for that . ( loudhisses ) ( dropsechoing ) I had about 26 sounds . A book . (
zone3	loud_thud ) Nobody realizes how loud a book can be . Now you enlarge that sound . No , it 's
zone3	hardcover . ( pianointroplays ) ( hornblows ) ( laughterandcheering ) Is someone giving birth back there ? Name it after me . These are the glasses that we are seriously contemplating using for some of the sequences . Let me try the other one's now . Oh , God , that pinches . Profile smile ... to see that the teeth are correct . ( manlaughs ) This is the makeup with a little more red . Murphy : I do get to stretch more when I put stuff on , because you have whatever your baggage is when you show up , and your little stuff that people expect of you . When you 're somebody else , they do n't know what to expect . You get to do a lot of different things . And Jerry did that , you know , before anybody as well . Hello , Los Angeles tower . This is Eddie 's Airways , the airline for the birds . Ha-ha-ha ! A little pun . Chase : I think of him put in a situation the way you put Peter
zone3	's got this stuff on his nose . Do n't tell me that that had n't occurred to Jerry a few years earlier . ( laughs ) Battle stations ! ( ringingbells ) Murphy : Peter Sellers gets credited with doing stuff like that . Jerry 's doing it before everybody 's doing multiple character stuff . Chase : This guy ... me , Fletch , using multiple funny costumes that I wore ... if it in any way rang of Jerry Lewis , I 'm proud of it . - Man : Your name , sir . - Uh , Bugs Peyton . What is it again ? I said Bugs Peyton . My name ... Bugs Peyton . Mugs Peyton ? Hey , schmuck , Bugs , not Mugs . What 's this there ? A television ? - Yeah . - Yeah . - What business are you in ? - I 'm a priest . ( crewlaughing ) Man : You 're a priest ? Yeah , free rites at the Mormon Tabernacle Temple in Idaho . Man : You look Jewish to me . -
zone3	think Jerry should get a Kennedy Center honor . Jerry Lewis : Jack came out of the service when Dean and I were playing the Chez Paree in Chicago . And we lived at the Ambassador East . I had a suite on the north side and Jack 's suite was on the south side . And he would come in to me every once in a while and asked me what I thought of this paragraph , and he reads it . And about the third time he came in with something , I said , " Are you doing a speech ? Are you appearing somewhere ? " He said , " No , this is something else . I 'm calling it ' Profiles in Courage . " ' I said , " Really ? " The book that became my bible . I 'd give my soul if I could have dinner with Jack Kennedy again . He never ever spent time with me that I did n't hear something I never wanted to forget . One day we were in Hyannis Port and we 're
zone3	Jack Kennedy told me for sure ... " Do n't get into anything political . You 're gon na lose half your audience . " Whenever I came to see Jack Kennedy , he made sure I came up through the bowels of the White House , up through the staircase and into the Oval Office , so that the press did n't ever know I was with him . I had 19 visits and no one ever knew it . I did his last birthday appearance . It was the night of his birthday at the Armory and I was teasing Jack . ( onstage ) Could you put the light on so I can see if he 's here ? Mr . Pres ... would you just wave so I know ? Is he here ? Because if you got me here all the way for nothing ... Is that you ? Mr . President , it 's me ... Jerry . Remember ? The nut . I voted for you . ( narrating ) I 'll never forget it , as long as I live . Seinfeld
zone3	tires_screech ) It 's even harder to do that than some other forms of comedy where you have dialogue and character . Just get in a car and make me laugh . ( hummingatune ) ( Seinfeldchuckling ) That is not easy . ( womanoverspeaker ) Fella ! Yes , Stepmother . Stepmother : Where 's my car ? Seinfeld : To drive a Rolls Royce and to make the car funny , to drive funny ... no one else has ever done this . This is brilliant . This is sophisticated . You got ta be a genius to figure out how to make a car drive funny , so that you watch the car and you laugh at the car . Enjoy your ride , Stepmother . I fixed the car perfectly mechanically beautifully . ( wheezes ) Seinfeld : This is not lowbrow to me . This is the highest brow . Jerry Lewis , Noel Coward ... you know , right there . ( carcreaking ) - My name is Bettina Bailey . - What is it ? - Bettina . - Bettina ? - Bettina
zone3	, I want to let you know my lifelong dream , if you would n't mind , to hug you , please . Here ? ( laughter ) Now ? Or if you got a room back there , you know , either way . ( laughter ) It 's so nice of you . I 'll tell you what : After the show , if you come backstage , I will let security know to let you in . I will give you a hug , but I can not promise you that it 'll end there . Woman : On Myspace , they asked , " Who would you most like to meet ? " Well , my number one was God , - but my number two was you . - ( crowdexclaims ) So maybe we can make it a threesome with Bettina - and let me come back , get a hug ? - ( laughterandcheering ) I 'm gon na be busy , ai n't I ? Is the drug store open ? You do n't need it . I 've gone through menopause
zone3	One , two , three , four ... What I do when I dance is fake . ( laughs ) I am one of the faking fools . The dancing became a part of the writing process . ( swingmusicplaying ) What I love about Jerry is , he 's never had a dance lesson in his life , he told me . He fakes it . Well , goodness me , he fakes better than I dance . ( swingmusiccontinues ) I know nothing about dancing other than time , rhythm . I stood in the wings watching my dad at the ripe age ... five , six , seven , eight . I mean , I watched some of the best dancers in the world . He was trying to experiment with comedy in a weird way that Gene Kelly was trying to experiment with what you could do with dance in movies . ( fanfare ) ( percussionintroplays ) ( jazzorchestraplaying ) Jerry Lewis : I gave the crew the setup . I had tracks . Music was ready . And I had to be ready .
zone3	my own choreography . I did that in take one . Two setups ... I did the whole dance . The front office was in shock because I shot that whole sequence in four hours . I went up the stairs in eight seconds . - (
zone3	clock_chimes ) - I think I 'll have to get along . I 'll never forget you . Jerry Lewis : 66 steps in eight seconds . But at the top of the steps I had a heart failure . I was in Mount Sinai Hospital 30 minutes later . The insurance company did n't want to pay us . They did n't believe I made it in eight seconds . And they kept looking at the film . I said , " The film do n't lie . " 66 steps in eight seconds . ( chuckles ) While I 'm in the oxygen tent , my father opens the flap , looks in and says , " Do you know what you 're doing to your mother ? " My baby . I 'm lying here , hoping I 'm gon
zone3	know what I 'm doing to my mother . It was a perfect Jewish question . Oh , my child . ( laughter ) Seinfeld : He 's a brilliant musician of comedy . Comedy is math and music . It 's very precise and mathematical , but it has to have a musical kind of flow to it . ( playingfanfareintro ) Maybe it could be just a touch faster . Okay ? Same thing . Thanks . If you waved your arms faster , it would have been faster . ( musicianslaughing ) They played exactly what you were doing . Belzer : I watched JL rehearse a 36-piece orchestra and know every instrument . I mean , this is a musical genius in the true sense . ( orchestrastopsplaying ) Train wreck . ( laughter ) - Rick , where did that happen ? - We 've got it covered . ( laughing ) Jerry Lewis : When you get music in your soul and you are then becoming a creative artist ... I could never just put music over there . It was always imbued in
zone3	did in " The Patsy , " I do the kid that has tickets for the premiere but he 's not dressed for it . I chewed that scene for four days till I got it exactly the way I wanted it . And then , when I scored it , I still did n't get it perfect . And then I took one of the pieces of music that we had recorded and I Mickey-Moused it to go ... ( imitatessped-upmusic ) And it was one spot where it needed it . And it made it happen really , really good . I was very proud of the work . You know , you put a comic on the screen for an audience for eight minutes ... that 's almost a reel . ( musicslowsdown ) Without the music it would have been a whole , long eight minutes . The music moved it . It gave it that thing that an audience sitting in the theater needs to be told . - ( musicvamping ) - Pull the tracks out of there and look at it , and
zone3	work with wrong music . When you talk of comedy as the art form , it demands what music gives it . The trombone will play D-flat , you play E , and you play E-sharp , okay ? Listen to this , folks . ( dissonantchordplays ) Man : That is the shit . There 's always one that do n't belong there , but if it was out of there , it 'd be perfect . ( laughter ) - Thanks , Jerry . - Okay . Good night , ladies and gentlemen . - Do we have a gentleman ? - No . Good . Screw them . Cough . When you have a guy in the band who 's better than everybody else at his instrument , you got ta hear a solo . ( hummingatune ) And the same with Jerry ... you know , you want to see Jerry in a funny movie , and then you want to see him just do a solo , ' cause he 's that good .

zone3	what happened September the 4th , 1976 , that created the most talk in the world of television . ( studioapplause ) I have a friend who loves what you do every year . Arthur Forrest : This is quite a story that almost nobody knows . It was 1976 . And the phone rang . It 's Frank Sinatra . He said , " If I was to bring Dean on the show , how do you think he 'd react ? " And I said , " I think he would react marvelously . " And they had n't really reconciled yet . Forrest : And he says , " I 've arranged it . He wants to do the show . " We did n't tell anybody because we knew if it leaked out , I would be a dead man . They said , " He 'd come up in a limo with seven or eight people and Dean would be one of them with a raincoat and a hat and glasses . " I said , " When Frank comes out , make sure all
zone3	all the PR people you can in the audience . It 's gon na be a big story . " They said , " What is it ? " I said , " I ca n't tell you , but just trust me . " Sinatra : Just tell him out there to come in . (
zone3	cheering_and_applause ) Jerry Lewis : We would meet for the first time in 20 years only because of the stupidity of when people get highly emotional . And we both felt badly about that . And I 'm looking , and I went , " Oh my gosh , that 's Dad walking out , " ' cause I could tell his walk . And then when I saw his face and I saw Jerry 's face and they hugged ... Chris Lewis : That scream that came out of that audience of 750 people ... I mean , it sounded like 750,000 people . It was just amazing . Jerry Lewis : People love to know that love prevails . So how have you been ? ( laughter ) Jerry Lewis :
zone3	see one another . And then they got back . And when they kissed and hugged at that last moment , it was worth all of that . We have n't seen each other for 20 years . ( laughs ) Yeah . Well , you know , there was all those rumors about our breaking up , and then when I started the show and you were n't here , I believed it . Everybody was just dumbfounded . There was n't a dry eye in the house . So you 're working ? (
zone3	laughter_and_applause ) I love your movies . You 're , like , the only thing my parents and I can agree on . What did you think of the Eddie Murphy movie ... " The Nutty Professor " movie ? I produced it . What do you think I thought of it ? After you cashed the check , what did you think of it ? It was my financial pleasure , I guarantee you . ( laughs ) As a filmmaker , I 've been inspired by Jerry . And one of my
zone3	Nutty Professor . " When I got the chance to do that again , that was like , " This has to be incredible . " Because of my love for this man , this artist , it was like , " There 's no way we 'll do this movie and not , you know , crush it . " He was able to look at Jekyll and Hyde and see that , hey , that 's funny that you could be this double life and all that whole stuff . That 's what 's really brilliant about " The Nutty Professor . " John Landis : I thought Eddie was extraordinary . I thought his character as Sherman Klump was an absolutely extraordinary character , and sweet . Murphy : That 's another thing that 's pioneered by Jerry ... mixing sweet and funny . You do n't see that until Jerry Lewis . You see funny and you see madcap and you see slapstick , but a character really sweet and funny ... that 's Jerry . You ca n't do comedy unless you know drama .
zone3	reality . And you ca n't be funny unless you know what the reality is . He mastered that very early . You may not believe this , but I was a very homely child . ( laughter ) Burnett : He was amazing ... amazing to work with . Really ? Yes . My father suggested plastic surgery . Oh , yeah ? When are you gon na have it ? ( laughs ) I had it already . They did a very unusual job . Burnett : A lot of clowns can do straight stuff . I loved him in " King of Comedy . " You go that far out ... it 's easier to bring it back in . ( crowdclamoring ) Jerry ! Jerry ! Jerry Lewis : I am fortunate I crossed over as strongly as you can in " The King of Comedy . " If you are equipped to do physical , wild craziness as I have and do ... I love ... argh ! Oh , I with it comes an authoritative figure that comes from down deep that can now
zone3	, the ratings , the same guests , the same questions ... I 'm just not enjoying it anymore . I got more critical acclaim from that film that I did for any of the work that I did in my whole life . Critics acclaiming , acclaiming , " Oh , he was this , " and I 'm thinking to myself , " You schmuck , do you realize I showed up and I just read the words and went home ? " I mean , I did n't have to do anything . I had to be me . Crystal : Maybe the best performance he gave was " King of Comedy , " you know , as a serious actor . That was harnessing him in a different way . That was another side of Jerry . Oh , he was great in it . And he embraced who he was . And he ... you know , it was n't the Jerry that we knew . He was a different guy . You listen to my stuff for 15 minutes , that 's all .
zone3	. I have a life , okay ? - Well , I have a life too . - That 's not my responsibility . Well , it is when you tell me to call you and then you do n't ... I told you to call to get rid of you . In the Scorsese film he 's more of a leading man than he ever was in any film , and he was older . This is a leading man ? Well , actually I was just mixing these so that we could try using it on the skin . You wonder , what kind of career would Lewis have had if he decided he wanted to play really kind of straightforward , good-looking leading man . Lewis could have done that . - ( applause ) - You 're very wise . ( laughter ) Now if you 'll just hold it a second , I 'll thrill you some more . Seinfeld : He came up with the character of Buddy Love . He wanted to take the worst qualities of the worst people he had ever
zone3	You rude , discourteous egomaniac . You 're crazy about me , right ? And I can understand it . Only this morning , looking in the mirror before shaving , I enjoyed seeing what I saw so much , I could n't tear myself away . ( kisses ) Have some , baby ? Seinfeld : And he was shocked to find that a lot of young people loved Buddy Love . Thank you , kiddies . You 're all very , very nice little boys and girls . Seinfeld : Jerry is incapable of not putting love into everything he does . Buddy Love , as mean as he tried to play him ... That 's good for you . Buddy Love is loveable , as much as he wanted him not to be . Harrelson : If you did n't know it was Jerry Lewis and you just met both of those guys , you would n't know that it was the same person . So it 's amazing how he created those two completely distinct characters . I do n't want to be something that I
zone3	. He 's just a guy who truly understands the material and he can just go to the depth that he needs to go to make it really , you know , touching and emotional . ( sighs ) You might as well like yourself . Just think about all the time you 're gon na have to spend with you . He probably could have made a lot of films that he did n't make . He 's that talented . Scott Lewis : In 1995 , when he did " Damn Yankees , " it was just about the most exciting thing I can ever remember my dad doing in his career . Chris Lewis : I was there for opening night on Broadway . And I was in a number of cities with him around the country . It 's such a great experience for him . People would say to me , " Your dad is 70 years old and he 's doing eight shows a week , my God . " I said , " Are you kidding ? He would pay to get eight
zone3	people onstage , it becomes a family . And that 's his ideal situation . That 's perpetual motion for him . It will keep him going , you know , with fuel forever and ever and ever . Crystal : I saw him in " Damn Yankees . " The Devil has a big song called " Those Were the Good Old Days . " But when Jerry does it , it becomes 25 minutes long . Suddenly he 's doing this cane thing . It has nothing to do with " Damn Yankees . " " Throw me a cane . A cane for ... " And the canes are flying . And suddenly you 're in ... it 's burlesque and you might as well be seeing Chaplin . Sit there and enjoy for 20 minutes the genius of a guy who , you know , is one of the few who can do this . So I went backstage and I just looked at him and I went , " The canes . " And he just ... he said , " I know . I
zone3	. I got to . " " Paris Match " one , " Paris Match " two ... - very glad to see you . - " Paris Match " three ... ( JerryLewisnarrating ) " Time " Magazine ran " The Most Popular People In the World By Appearance , " and one was the president , two was Muhammad Ali ... Jerry Lewis : How are you ? Where do you want me ? Let 's go . ( narrating ) ... three was Mao Tse-tung , and four was the Pope and Jerry Lewis , who tied . The year after that , I made four by myself . It was very nice . This would n't get printed right here . ( manlaughs ) You got ta go here . Yeah . Man : Yeah , that 's perfect . You should act like that . Oh , you like that ? Here , grab that . How 's that ? ( mumbles ) Are you finished ? I 'm through . ( laughing ) Man : Can I have a little bit more ? Man
zone3	( screams ) ( tromboneplaying ) " The Nutty Professor " inspired everything I did afterwards , as far as my career . " The Nutty Professor " is his baby . Jerry is actually going to be directing it on Broadway . He said , " I want you to play that character . " Jerry Lewis : Marvin Hamlisch and Rupert Holmes have written 12 numbers already . I 'm gon na be the Jewish George Abbott . He directed his last show when he was 99 . - (
zone3	camera_shutters_clicking ) - Jerry Lewis : It 's very interesting , because of all of the work and all of the silliness that made children laugh that come to me now and say , " I 've grown up with you . " What they 're saying is , " I 'm not coming to you as the adult to proclaim this . I come to you as the child that recognizes the child that did it . " Harrelson : There 's something that came through about him that made America and the world fall in love
zone3	this incredible childlike brilliance . I let you talk me into this ridiculous chair because I felt sorry for you . - Now just open there . - Look , I do n't need this . - Oh , there . - You missed . You missed . - No , you missed now , Herbert . - You missed . Jerry Lewis : People want to make contact with someone that advanced their childhood through humor , and it 's a very special thing . It gives me the kind of energy to come forward and do more . Generation after generation is rediscovering , rediscovering him . When they see him , they become the 10-year-old that they were the first time they saw him . Jerry Lewis : Most of my audience was six and eight and 11 when I exploded on the scene . And now they got children who have children who want to see Jerry . (
zone3	laughter_and_applause ) Tarantino : As far as like his fan base , that required children to be renewed and get involved in Jerry Lewis movies . And
zone3	. Richard Lewis : Worldwide , children , no matter what language they spoke , they got him . You know , you try to find a comedian who can , you know , score in Iceland and then do a nightclub date in Brooklyn . Not happening , man . Oh ... Burnett : They do n't even have to know what he 's saying . It 's in his face . It 's in his body . It 's in everything that he ... he 's just ... he 's just funny . Harrelson : What 's cool to me is , I was getting ready to go to bed and my daughter says , " You want to watch a movie , Daddy ? " " I guess I could watch something . What do you want to watch ? " She said , " Can we watch a Jerry movie ? " Hey ! " Can we watch Jerry Lewis ? " I was like , " You bet we can . " ( blowsair ) There 's not one film that Jerry Lewis has that
zone3	of his stuff just like you watched it then . And it 's funny just like it was back then . It 's timeless . And it 's accessible family entertainment forever , forever and ever . Crystal : If you look at those homo sapiens things ... it 's a monkey , then it 's a guy walking this way ... if it was comedy , it would be circus clowns and then it would be the court jesters . And then it starts to ... there 's this guy walking , and it 's Charlie Chaplin . Then it 's Harold Lloyd . Then it 's Keaton . And then there 's Jerry and he 's walking on his ankles . He 's just one of the great comedy directors , you know , not only of his era but of all time . Murphy : You can see his influence on a couple of different generations of people , you know , and not just as a comic but as a filmmaker . You see his impact all over the place . ( jazzorchestraplaying ) Alec Baldwin
zone3	years or so ... they have a debt to Lewis and what he did . ( Frenchaccent ) Are you the father of Jim Carrey ? I banged his mother many years ago . Landis : And he 's got this legacy ... his films and his television shows . What 's incredible about Jerry Lewis is how long he 's been in the public eye . The only true test is time . And , you know , people are still watching Jerry 's pictures . Thank you . Murphy : Who 's done that , an 80-year run ? Has anyone done that ? That has to be some kind of record . Chase : We all know who Jerry Lewis is in some way . We know that he 's a serious man . He 's accomplished a great deal . I 'm not saying he 's the greatest human . I 'm not comparing him to FDR . Eleanor ... maybe . Baldwin : He really is the Marlon Brando of comedy films . He 's the Marlon Brando . Where everyone apes Brando , everybody
zone3	Herman . - Hey , lady ! - Herman . - Hey , lady . - He-hey ! - Classic , classic . Seinfeld : It 's hard to be silly in a way that makes people laugh . Being silly is like ... is like being an astrophysicist . You have to be incredibly sophisticated to be silly . Some people look at Jerry Lewis and do n't understand that what he 's doing is extremely sophisticated at its silliest . There he is . Do you think I should do the whole body ? Belzer : He 's from another planet . It 's very hard for anyone , I think , to totally understand Jerry Lewis in the entirety of who he is as a man , who he is as an artist , who he is as an industry , as a philanthropist . I mean , he 's like a mountain . Some people get caught in the foothills of him , but you have to really scale the peaks to truly appreciate the phenomenon of Jerry Lewis . Oh-hh ! I 'm infinitely grateful
zone3	I beat Burns . - ( laughter ) I got ta beat Burns . I just put my daughter in college , so I have to wait four years for that to work . But then I 'm gon na have her meet a very nice young man . And then she 's gon na get married . I 'm gon na walk down the aisle with her . And then I 'm gon na be in the hospital to see the baby . - ( laughter ) - So that 's my plan for the next 16 years . And I hope you 'll all join me . Thank you so much . I think Jerry Lewis 's legacy will simply be the familiarity , the household familiarity of the name Jerry Lewis . I think that says it all and will always say it all ... Jerry Lewis . Jerry Lewis : Audiences will look at me and I will say , " I 'm blessed . What I have been able to do with my life has been extraordinary . But until I leave here tonight ,

One night they came ... and they fired some shots . To scare us . So we would leave . A bullet went through a wall ... and my daughter was killed while she slept . We were going to testify . My wife and I . The man responsible for it all ... Alphonse .
zone3	to trial . And they were followed . He was afraid to use his own guys , so ... they sent a crew of Albanians after us . They killed my wife . And they thought they killed me too . And they should have made sure of it . Cigarette ? Yeah . When I manage to forget what happened to me . When there are no mirrors , and no people that reminds me . And my mom makes me laugh . These moments . I have hope . Maman says that I ... that it 's these moments that makes the pain bearable . These moments ... I should try and find them where I can and ... hang onto them . But they 're fleeting . And then I remember and ... I 'm filled with so much hale ... that I want to set the whole world on fire . I 'm sorry I made you tell about your family .

Have you just gotten Priest ? And now ... And now you do not ... - Do you like it ? - No , no , no . Do not misunderstand me . I had to do it . I want to serve Jesus . I have a past full of plagues - and brutality , and the ... Sometimes I wonder who I am to act as So righteous and inflated devoutly And believe that everything I do is for good . Is it to escape there past like you are in Italy ? I was not a good Christian in San Francisco . I was not at all good . My life was about to rob Mistreat vandalize . I was a tough guy . I thought that violence was only way to get what you wanted . But then something happened . I had done something terrible
zone3	in faith to me . Suddenly I was overwhelmed by a desire to leave it all behind me And become a priest in a foreign country . Here I am . - Were you alone ? - No , I started the thread . Then I got older and more powerful . I could do no wrong . I was the leader . How long have you lived in Rome ? For two years and then gave I of two years . The American woman sitting a few seats from us . She saw her husband murdered for years ago- and she has not yet found peace . I ran into her in Rome . I knew she was looking for me . And somehow I was looking for her . She has haunted me ever since . As if I had any answers . We are plagued all of our Past . God , was not it amazing ? He ? ? is so romantic . Tony looks really good . Lily should return to Italy . Every summer used William and his brother spend time with their dad

It 's really true . It is not easy to keep up with her . She was a waitress when she met him on a business trip . He , however , fell directly on her . Look at her features . He lent her money for to start a business . Assecoarbolaget she started had a very popular handbag . Everyone was as crazy about it . She came into vogue . Donna Karen was a fan . The money he got back on a six months and then he married her . Smart guy . She served soon more money than he . Not really . He was my anchor . It is said that behind every great woman is a great man . - So true . - Is not it the opposite ? It works both ways . I have two exceptional women in my life

They have nothing with my business to do . Your mother sits on the board of the museum . You could easily have moved stuff to her inflated friends . Everything that we worked with in the past should stay in the past . My mom has always worked so much . She did not know what I did . So I helped you . We made a lot . I 'm not too proud of it . And my wife , Deborah See everything that happens . She is way too smart and asks too many questions . He has been with me on the boat . I would have told the truth ? That you blew a guy .

This will never work . My life has changed . Everything can be traced nowadays . It 's not like the old where when there was internet . I can not risk revealed . My father is dead . He was the only one who could protect me ... and you and us . Now must myself take care of family business . My wife is a smart chick . She sees everything . She wants to focus on policy , and nothing will stop her . I have changed . That 's why I asked you to marry you with a young and stupid chick . Then you would not need to worry . Do not tell me what to do . You always do . Should you decide who I marry ? Should you decide who to be my mom ? Get
zone3	up everywhere and haunt me like a stalker . As weeds that refuse to extinction . Maybe you like to be eradicated . Okay ... - Antonio ... - How nice to meet you . - Bravo . - You were absolutely wonderful . Thank you for your compliments . I 'm sorry your dad 's passing . I grew up with him in Tuscany .

I left everything behind me , but some sins can not erase . I know , but all sins can be forgiven . Do not talk nonsense . Sins can not be forgiven without ... - Without compensation ? - Yes . Indemnity is the word . I left Sicily because I thought I already atoned for my sins . It was just bullshit . Four years earlier , Sicily . Do you understand , Vito ? If we do the job , we are on the dry in two or three years . - I can give mom some money . - But it is dangerous . - Bullshit . - Are we invited ? Do not you know that by marriage , funerals and confession are all welcome . I had forgotten . - Where do we work ? - Have a little patience . Now we go

He 's an asshole and a total disaster . I should have killed him before I came here . It 's never too late . It can still do . No , it 's not the right time . I knew you would not disappoint me . What are you talking about ? Are you kidding ? Do you see how beautiful the country is ? I am blessed . I do not I am from this country . I have promised to bring me my mom again . But not until I cleared it . And then came the assholes ... The fucking bastards Came to Chicago To silence me . Silencing me . Silent Me ... Seven years ... - That 's correct , sir . - Seven years . One , two , three , four , five , six , seven . What they got out of

I fucked up at all
zone3	Then I saw him in the eye . I felt sorry for him . In the family there are no feelings like that . Being lawlessness is okay , but to be killer ... Why is that ? Okay , that 's fine . This time I let it be but from now on you know nothing about what happens in the family . Tomorrow I meet your friend Vito anyway . We 'll see what he can do . Get out now . Goodbye , Don Miche . - Where is he ? - Who ? - The man who escaped . - Stop , Go away now . - What do you mean ? - That you will pull . Otherwise you will annoy me all day .

You take care of your family . Family is very important . Honor , respect and family . It is as if we where an American film . And the guy ... I 'll give you an offer you can not say no to . Listen Franco . We need help a friend from Trapani to Rome . Calabrese , formerly dealt with apartments . Now he deals with drugs , weapons . They have political patronage- and until someone in the police force . Banda della Magliani is back . And Casalesi behave like assholes . - We have to do something about it . - I
zone3	you to others . - I send Peppuccio . He is merciless and he 's already people in the area . The other problem then ? Davide ... He 's a good guy , but he has no stake . He 's weak . According to me he is useless unlike his friend Vito . - They are sloppy . Two petty thieves . - Vito is a man . He has been married to flowing into your eyes . You must keep an eye on Vito . He can take care of something simple , a club , or the like . From now on , so keep I an eye on him . By the way , he talks way too much for by priests . Post by ? Is he more Catholic than my mom ? - How 's business ? - Good , you can ask the cashier about it . There was no specific question . I want to know if you feel comfortable with us . - Yes , everything is going well . - Good . Then I am satisfied . I met
zone3	? is already a member of the family . He is upright . He ? ? also has the ability to kill . Thank you for giving me the this opportunity . I am also happy for Vito 's sake . Now he can work and earn money . He will help you in suburbs and downtown . In the suburbs ? As you wish , Don Miche . Okay , Davide . We have problems with some shopkeeper who did not want to pay . Ya . Satan American . He started run things in Palermo . It 's that time of Toto Riina and Carleonesi . You start you do not do those vitamins . Vito has always been responsive . But what you do not know Vito is that we got a lot of shit of this Mancino . - What about New York ? - We do not ask for help yet . But we must act and think as in the past . We need to keep the rest of family out of this . Did you call on us for already know everything ?
zone3	the Barbarians a taste so that they understand we are hard and we has not weakened . We 'll send them a message . A message that means " war " ! - Do you need anything ? - What do you think ? - Want a drink ? - No . Okay then ... Bongiorno , sign . Excuse Roberto . He is a good man . I 'm John ... Mancino . Do not forget that . That 's Luigi . He works with me . He is a sons spy . He is good at . He takes account of things I need to know . He has been eyeing up some of your new friends . Cortellos ... He finds out what they think , every they go and who they trust . These things . He explains it to me . I listen and listen and listen . Sometimes I even ... What is it ? - A discrepancy . - Yes , that word . There is a woman hangs all the time with them . She pops up here and there without some
zone3	different name . She calls herself Adele . Who is the woman ? Why does she do that ? How did she get in there ? It is not easy to infiltrate with such types . Then I got out there for that kind secrets cleans easily . Her real name is not the which she has presented itself as is Mary . - Yes , I 'm Mary . - Okay . Then we found out that Maria experienced something horrible . Something terrible . Her husband was murdered . So why she hangs with them and are so friendly and nice ? She shows up at all their parties ... He , who is very smart says : " What if it is the who murdered her husband ? " Why would she hang with killers ? Those who have done terrible things . Why ? - Revenge . - Is that what you want ? Luigi is very smart . There he listed out . Do not worry . There is no danger . Luigi wants a flower , but he gets none . This is for
zone3	scared , huh ? Vito , why are you here ? Do they trust not in me anymore ? Obviously they trust you . They thought you had come to provide you . I 've got so much of it there shit that I can provide the entire Palermo . You call that shit ? For me it 's a job . A new guy from America got here . His name Mancino . He 's a dangerous guy . The people of Genoa wants him dead . He ? ? does not respect the rules . He has formed a gang and has tried to take over a part of Palermo . A large part of Sicily . What are you talking about ? Have they come from America to take over Palermo ? Then they have someone who protects them . Where did you hear that crap ? The information has come directly from New York . I stood behind the door so I could not fail to hear it . They have told us to be quiet , but I think it ends badly . The bastard
zone3	. Do you understand ? Vito end up stories . Be quiet . Be sure to stay away from bullets . Motherfuckers not kidding . Listen , Mary . I 'm not one to mince the words . I 'm not rich right now . I 'm not the type that comes with gifts . Okay ? So here 's the deal . I always expect something in return . I 'll give you what you need for your revenge . Okay ? Together We will delete Cortellofamiljen from the map . Are you in ? There is a problem . You are a woman . I 'm not inclined to let a woman do what I ask of you . Honestly So are girls pretty emotional . If you plan to implement it here consider you are no longer that woman . You can be a mother when you want it . But when you 're having me to no lovers ...

( STRUGGLING ) ( SHUSHING ) ( **29;3314;TOOLONG ) - KENNEDY : Morning , partner . - Hey . When did they call it in ? About three hours ago . A couple of joggers found her after the tide went out . Watch your step here , it 's a bit dicey . Victim is Caucasian female , mid-20 's suffered severe trauma from apparently falling off this structure right over here . I 've also got a partial ID . Found a British passport that lists her as a Samantha Walker and a driver 's license that shows a local address in Hollywood . Why only partial ? She was out here for most of the night . Seems like maybe the local wildlife took a run at her . See if you can find someone to confirm the identity . Track down the next of kin . If she 's got a visa , State

( HELICOPTERBLADESWHIRRING ) SOLDIER : Walker , the man needs to see you . You wanted to see me , sir . Give us a minute . You are aware that all voice and e-mail communications sent to and from this base are monitored under standard security protocols ? Well , of course , yeah . We received this yesterday while you were on patrol . I 'm sorry , Walker , there is no easy way to say this . Your daughter was found dead after an apparent drug overdose earlier this week in Los Angeles . This ca n't be right . This ca n't be right . It 's a mistake , you 're
zone3	actually still there . They 'll need you to sign off on it before it can be shipped back to London for burial . I 'm gon na have to get the next chopper out of here . Yeah , well , it 's not as simple as that . Look , I know this is hard for you to understand , but when you signed your contract extension with Everest last March , you gave up certain liberties that government military personnel are allowed . You ca n't be serious . We 've been tasked with a major staging operation in coordination with the arrival of a senator from the States . We 'll need you for full tactical support . We 're talking about my daughter here . And you are a team leader at Everest . What the fuck has that got to do with anything ? Risk versus reward . When we brought you in from the British military , you were making less than ? 30,000 a year . At Everest , you 're making more than four times that . Now you listen to
zone3	be abandoning your operational post . No contractor in the world would touch you . Yeah ? Well , fuck you and yours . ( DAUGHTERGIGGLING ) ( NICKSPEAKSINDISTINCTLY ) Anyone there ? Hold on a minute , mate . (

Yeah , I 'll come down . WALKER : Listen , Nick , I just want to say thanks . I appreciate you looking after the place . NICK : Just wish it were under better circumstances . Yeah . You know , it 's funny ... We used to collect these from restaurants all over the world whenever we were on holiday . Melissa thought we 'd settle in this place . That we would build a life together having these dinner parties with plates from all over the world . I think it made me laugh . And it was a very good conversation piece
zone3	time we got to travel abroad was when ... Was when I got new orders . Grounded on the base ... No way to raise a kid . When was the last time you heard from her ? Months ago . I mean , after her mom died ... ( SIGHS ) Things kind of drifted . One month led to another month and then before you know it , we lost contact . I forget ... I forget how hard it was for her growing up in Los Angeles . I should have been there for her . I should have been a better dad , made the effort . Surprised you got back so early . They give you any problems when you asked for the time off ? Only for the fact because I told them to go fuck themselves . That 's classy . No matter where you seem to go , there 's more than likely a bridge that 's gon na get burned down . I do n't know how you made it in the military for as long as you did . Well
zone3	reason . But I 'm done with it now , I 've had enough . Twenty five years in service . Time to try something new . Any ideas ? No , not yet . But I 'm working on it . Look , Nick , I do n't want to put it on you , but I need your help . I need you to sort some stuff out for me . I need to ... I need to get rid of this house . The only things that are left here now are just memories I 'd rather forget . In this market , you 're not gon na get what it used to be worth . That do n't matter . There 's enough in this to at least get me started again . I 'll make some calls when you head over to the States . I 'm not with you , what do you mean , back to the States ? When you fly back to the States . I 'm not going anywhere , mate . You do n't know , do you ?
zone3	Los Angeles . Please tell me that you are fucking kidding me . They were supposed to bring her home tomorrow . After you contacted us , I thought you would have heard . No , because they cut all communication when I left the base . Fucking hell . You got your phone on you ? Back at the house . WALKER : I 'm gon na need you to go and get it for me . I 'm gon na phone the airlines and get a direct flight out of here . That 's been here the whole time ? Well , it ai n't much , but it 's better than putting it in the bank . Give me five minutes . DR . HOLDEN : Listen , I apologize , Mr . Walker , for the delay . It 's been a bit slow down here today . Please do n't worry , I understand . Go ahead . What is this , some sort of a joke ? That 's not my daughter , that 's not Sam . I understand this can be difficult
zone3	time . I 'm telling you , you 're not listening to me . This is not my daughter . It 's not Sam . Just give me a second , hold on , let me check on this real quick . This ...

In the interest of speeding things up , what can I do for you ? What are you here for ? You knew my daughter , Samantha Walker ? Hmm ... Is that right ? Yeah , she worked for you . Well , for at least this company anyway . Well , I understand why you 'd think that , but something you should know is that I have hundreds of employees and I guess a pretty large portion of them I 've never met , and I 'm afraid your daughter is one of them . Well , gentlemen ,
zone3	do me a favor , Saphire should be sitting right outside that office . Would you ask him to come in and show this gentleman down to human resources , thanks . And now , Mister , uh , Walker , um , I 've got a webinar presentation . She was killed over a week ago . And the body they were gon na ship back to London was n't hers . Your corporate office was one of the last numbers she called . Uh , jeez , I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm very sorry to hear about that , accept my condolences . I just need some help . Tell me the last time she was here , times , dates , anything , please , I 'm begging you . I 'd really love to help you , but if you came here for those answers from me , I 'm sorry , again , I really am . I do n't know , this city , it 's ... I do n't know , it just gets rougher ... It 's rotten ,

( SIGHS ) MICHAEL : I could swear I just left here
zone3	over my ass . Sheriff 's Department pick up a guy on assault charges and immediately contacted us . Last time I checked , we were a major crimes unit . You might want to remind the Lieutenant that next time he calls us in for something like this . KENNEDY : I 'll keep that in mind . The assailant 's a British national . Military contractor , Iraq , Afghanistan . Got picked up at the offices of Most Industries down in Century City . Apparently he got into a heated argument and beat the living daylights out of the security detail . Here 's the catch . He says that his daughter was missing and he was trying to track her down through her last known employer . Her name 's Samantha Walker . Our San Pedro victim ? Yeah , told the arresting officers that they got the wrong girl . Well , find out if there 's any truth to it . Have Henderson pull the file and bring it down here . - Yeah . - I 'll see what I can get out
zone3	Walker . Long way across the pond , huh ? How long before I can get out of here ? Well , it 's not that simple . Sure it is . I know all about the American justice system . - Oh , do you ? - Yeah , set the arraignment and let 's go . I 've heard about your daughter . I have a young son . I ca n't imagine what you 're going through . Is there anyone in this town who 'll listen to me ? I 'm gon na say it again for the last time . My daughter 's not dead . The body they were gon na ship back to London is not Samantha 's . Well , maybe you could tell me why you busted up that place . That guy , um , Schuuster ... He 's not telling me everything . He knows Sam . You 're right about that . See , he gave us a full statement today and luckily he 's not gon na press charges . Well , is n't that big of
zone3	this date to change his mind , so if I were you , Mr . Walker , I 'd leave it alone . Look , I did not go in there to cause trouble . All I want to do is find my girl , get her safe , and bring her home , that 's it . (
zone3	knocking_on_door ) Excuse me a minute . Do n't worry , mate . I 'll be here . KENNEDY : All right , I pulled the file . Here 's what we 're looking at . There 's not much on her . Some parking tickets and shit , until about a month ago , when she got arrested at a DUI checkpoint at a bar in the Valley called Cabos . Look at this picture . It was taken four weeks ago the night she got arrested . And this one was taken at the crime scene right after they pulled the body from the water . I do n't know , it 's hard to tell , but the limey may be telling the truth . Pull the box
zone3	. My contact at the department said you refused to press charges . Your contact ? That would actually imply that you knew what you were doing . With all due respect , with Walker in jail , it buys us more time . For what ? I mean , if the girl was alive , the easiest way to track her is through the one man that wants her as badly as we do . Now that would be a good idea , do n't you think ? Do n't worry , I 'm on it . You 're on it , you 're on it . See , here 's the thing . You were responsible for all this in the first place . Why in God 's name would I let you go fuck this up over again , why ? We trailed her , from her apartment to the night club , exactly where you said she 'd be . Did you get the right girl ? She fit the description you gave us . Right . You know , when I came to this city
zone3	, corporations were going bankrupt , because of their problems with the union labor , but I changed all that . See I had a lot of cash to lend . There were borrowers all around the block . So basically I ... I painted a new face on the city , I made it look clean . So I became Mr . Wonderful , with love and respect from just about everyone . You respect me , Saphire ? See , I do n't think so , because now , for the first time ever , I got goddamn cops all around my house . Because of you , you fucking moron ! ( SAPHIRECHOKING ) 1881 , Castaic .

zone3	of the woman in the photograph . It 's your daughter 's passport , driver 's license and multiple credit cards . You can see how it would be an easy miss . You can justify it all you want , Detective . You got ta admit , you and your men were sloppy . Oh , is that right ? Yeah . Sure has a lot of plastic for a 25-year-old , do n't you think ? Yeah , well , what can I say ? Girls like to shop , do n't they ? Or she got turned upside down , over-extended . What 's this got to do with the fact that my daughter 's missing ? We 're not sure of anything . Total bollocks , the lot of it . Let me ask you a question , Mr . Walker . When was the last time you actually spoke to your daughter ? Are we through here , Detective ? My partner will walk you out . Taxi . Do you know a bar called Los Cabos ? Here 's 100 . Keep it running

A whiskey and a pint . $10.50 . $100 , keep it . Thanks . Let me get a favor . You see that girl ? You ever seen her in here ? No , I 've never seen her around here . You need to take a closer look at this , try it again . Have you seen her in here ? Like I said , I 've never seen her . Well , she got nicked right outside at a DUI checkpoint , about a month ago . They said she was in here . You a cop ? I 'm a long way from home . I 'm just an interested party . Now , have you seen her ? Have n't seen her . Give me another one . And here 's another $100 for you . Now let me jog your fucking
zone3	easy on the eyes . She got caught by the police about a month ago leaving this place . Now , have you seen her or not ? (

Now , please , please , if there 's anyone who might know anything . I have $10,000 here in cash . For any information that might lead me to her whereabouts . And the cash is yours , if I find her where you tell me . Anyone ? Hey . I know the girl you 're looking for . Is that right ? So where is she ? I tell you that and what 's to guarantee I get paid ?

Look , if this is gon na be a waste of my time , you can pull over now and give me my money back . - ( SIGHS ) - Or you can answer my questions . What was she involved in and who was she involved with ? Ricky Cummins , he runs the club . They came in to Cabos a few times after hours to score . And how would you know that ?

We do n't want any trouble . You do n't want any trouble ? Well , you got fucking trouble ! ( GROANING ) ( GUNSHOTS ) What the fuck ? What are you doing ?
zone3	. Go and get the car . MARGO : No , wait , we 've got ta figure ... - Go and get the car now ! - Okay . They ... They 're fucking dead ! You 've got exactly 30 seconds to tell me where she is . Otherwise , you 're gon na end up on the fucking floor dead like the rest of them . - You got me ? - Yeah . - Where is she ? - She 's ... She 's on Wilshire , I can take you . - You 're coming with us . - Okay . Silver one , right there . Get in . (
zone3	tires_screeching ) Just try and get us there in one piece , yeah ? Are you kidding me ? We 're fleeing the scene of a crime ! Well , then , try not to make it so obvious ! (
zone3	tires_screeching ) Directions , where are we going ? Tell her . RICKY : Go over Laurel Canyon . When you get down to Wilshire , hit the 101 South , downtown .
zone3	So why they after you ? Most Industries is a front , okay ? It does n't exist . It 's a shell Internet company . They steal people 's identities . - Explain to me how . - ( SIGHS ) Credit cards , payroll cards , and they put , like , $5,000 to $10,000 on the cards . They sell them to guys like me for half price . And then I sell them at the club , that 's what I do . You expect me to believe that shit ? I swear to God , I 'm telling you the truth . That 's what we do . So , tell me , how is my daughter involved ? You 'll have to ask her yourself . Do n't worry , mate , I plan on it . ( HELICOPTERBLADESWHIRRING ) ( **28;3345;TOOLONG ) (

zone3	door_closes ) All right , so , we got the call about an hour ago . Witnesses reported a fight broke out outside the club , and spilling out here . And no
zone3	were found lying right there . Description on the assailant ? It all happened so fast , what we got is spotty at best . Spotty what ? Spotty whites , spotty blacks ? Spotty Hispanic ? OFFICER : Uh , Caucasian male , 40 's , large build . One of the bartenders said he had some sort of crazy accent , so he definitely was n't from here . He was seen chasing after the guy who ran the club , a guy by the name of Ricky Cummins . KLEIN : You got any IDs on the victims ? OFFICER : No , no wallets , no cash , they 've just got their own prints on them . Talk to security , find out if they had cameras on top of the doors or is there any kind of surveillance on the exterior of the club . Will do . I want to find out where these guys came from . - Run down that Ricky . - OFFICER : Ricky Cummins . MICHAEL : Run him down . OFFICER : Will do . Double tap
zone3	Accent , military precision , leaves us with about one choice . Yup . Call dispatch , get a couple black and whites out to the residence of Karl Schuuster . Tell them we 'll be following . - You got it . - ( CARLOCKSBEEPING ) Are you sure about this ? Of course , I 'm sure about this . This is the safe house , buddy . We set it up a month ago when she got popped . - So how do we get inside ? - We do n't get inside . Remember when I was running through the parking lot ? I had the phone , I threw it ? That 's the only connection we have . You ca n't get inside right now . - Stay here . - Stay here , what ? You ca n't get inside , I 'm telling you . (
zone3	dogs_barking ) ( CLEARSTHROAT ) What do you want ? Go and tell Sam that daddy 's here to take her home . Man , it 's late , all right ? BRUCE : And I

All right . - No , that would not be the case . - I got it . - Uh , Detective Michael Klein . - How you doing ? This is my partner , Det ... Hey , uh , look , I was just telling your man over here that , uh , I have the utmost confidence in my security system here and , uh , as you can see , I
zone3	n't think you understand the severity of the situation . We are tracking a suspect who 's involved in a shooting on the West side . Left three people dead . Now his description very closely resembles the man who was arrested in your office earlier today . Well , why would you think he 'd come here ? He believes his daughter , who used to work for you , is missing . Miss Walker was found dead of a drug overdose about a week ago , no ? It 's not public knowledge . Well , I 'm sure it 's not . I had this little conversation with a lieutenant earlier today . Chatted a bit . Well , that case is still pending a review . Yeah , right . Well , I mean , it could be , uh ... ( CHUCKLING ) Of course , this is my view , just one of the normal cases where these young kids come in here . Want to be attractive , people who look for their fame and fortune , and , uh , things do
zone3	they got here , except they look a little worse , you know ? Yeah , that happens . Mr . Schuuster , you may still be able to help us . Have you ever seen these men before ? Um , no , no , I ca n't say that I have . Listen , I really appreciate you looking out for my best interest , but , uh , you 'll have to excuse me . There 's , uh ... I have some special guests I 'd like to attend to . I do n't blame you , yeah . Tell you what , we 'd like to keep a couple officers out front , in case this suspect ... No , no , that 's really not necessary . Just the same . Okay , then , well , you 'll just have to submit a request to the board , uh , you know that oversees these estates . Uh , that would be , I think , the first Tuesday in every month . Anyway , you guys have a nice night , nice
zone3	: We 're happy to have you back . SCHUUSTER : Did you miss me ? Well , I 'm happy to be here . - You believe one word of that bullshit ? - Not one . Call Judge Booth , see if we can get authorization for a surveillance team . - At this hour ? - Let 's wake his lazy ass up . - Thanks . - ( CHUCKLING ) Mmm . Excuse me for a minute , will you , honey ? The last contact was several hours ago . It seems they 've completely fallen off the grid . Listen , gather everybody we got . I want him and her back here . I do n't care if they 're standing or laying down . I want them back here now , come on . Yes , sir . ( SIGHS ) Give me one of those , can you ? Sure . - That good ? - Thanks . You 're welcome . ( SIGHS ) Nobody heard nothing . We should be good for now . No , if he can
zone3	have to get packed and moved out of here tonight . ( SIGHS ) I see you 've got your mother 's taste in men . - Present company excluded . - ( WALKERSIGHS ) Easy , there , Dad . It looks like you 've taken a few hits . Yeah , I have , and you know why ? Because I 've been looking for you . I mean , Sam , what was you thinking , disappearing like that without even contacting me . Do n't start with me now . Do you know something ? If your mother was alive ... God , if she was alive , she 'd have been worried sick and panic-stricken . Hmm , but not you . That 's not what I said . I have n't heard from you in months . ( SCOFFS ) Do you know something ? I 've been beaten up , nearly stabbed , shot at , and electrocuted . All things I 'm sure you 've grown accustomed to . Do you have any idea ... Any idea ... What it 's been
zone3	you was alive or dead , who you was with , where you was . I mean , for all I know , you could have been lying dead in a ditch somewhere ! You know , you never seemed to care before , so why now ? I 'll tell you exactly why . Because you 're the only one I 've got left now . And like it or not , you 're still my daughter . Look , listen to me , there ... There was only one thing I was ever good at . And being a young dad was n't it . But I 'm here now for you . Yeah . Please , you 've got to believe me , I 'm not here to judge you . I do n't care what trouble you 've got yourself into . All I care about is you . That you 're safe and I can bring you home . ( SIGHS ) I needed everyone in my life to believe I was dead . Because if he knew I was still alive , he 'd
zone3	Schuuster created a series of Internet banks and an online lending solution . It was a phishing scam . Every applicant that went to the website submitted information that he used to steal their identity . This is a database that contains the names of hundreds of thousands of people that he 's stolen from . So how has he not been caught ? The websites were set up at hosting facilities all over the country . The sites would be up for a week and then removed . Nothing , not even an imprint was left to chance . So how did you get involved in this ? I was hired as a programmer to manage the root access database . Good morning , Most Industries . How may I direct your call ? SAM : Several months ago , I started finding discrepancies in the risk scoring that was used to approve and deny loan applications . So I tracked it through to the credit services department . And that 's when I met ... What , this fucking geezer ? Jesus , Dad . I needed more
zone3	( SAMTYPING ) SAM : I found a way to back up the database , so I could get it in the hands of the FBI . But I knew if they arrested him , he 'd still have the resources to come after me . So I needed a way out . Then I created a series of accounts and identities . And I funded it with 10 million dollars that I got from the Most Industries ledger account . I simply had to merge the new database into the mainframe host processor . And once the cards were created , I could activate the accounts and transfer the funds . Schuuster 's people were never prepared for an internal breach . Are you sure these are clean ? Yeah , I bought the plane tickets with them today . So I need your passport . SAM : Before I had a chance to transfer the funds ... - Mmm . - ( LAUGHING ) I knew I only had a few days before Schuuster found out I was arrested . I was able to get the accounts activated
zone3	the funds . ( BEEPING ) It 's just a small piece of the pie , nothing that he would even notice . Then why did he want you dead ? ( SIGHS ) Well , when I was busted , they caught his cards on me . And then he knew I was a risk to him . And the other girl ? Let me know as soon as you cash them . - Okay , I will . - Thank you so much . Cathy was my roommate . After I ran from the office , I had her met up with Ricky . There was n't enough time . So Ricky was the only one that could still get into the facility . But it was too late . So the money 's in limbo and everyone wants it back . You know , there 's still a way for us to do this clean . Yeah , well , I do n't see that unless we get inside that building . Schuuster has a secondary server set up in his panic room in his estate .
zone3	into the office , we just have to get into that room . Yeah , well , how do you propose we do that ? RICKY : I have an idea . There is one thing that he likes better than money . WALKER : What ? I 'm missing something , what is it ? SAM : Escorts . What ? No , no ! Come on , it 's the only way we can get inside . No , look , our deal was 10,000 if I helped you find her . That 's it , done . You 're a target now , just like us . ( SCOFFS ) Bullshit , I am . WALKER : She 's right . I mean , how long do you think it 's gon na be before he finds out you was involved ? Yeah , well , I 'll take my chances . Here you go , 10 grand . Nice doing business with you . Fifty grand . MARGO : You 're gon na have to do better than that , mate . WALKER : All right
zone3	Let 's make it an even hundred thousand . And how is it we still ca n't tie the rental car to either Most Industries or Karl Schuuster ? We 've been over this . Well , tell me again . The credit card was authorized three days ago . Who made the reservation , who signed for the car , and why is it being declined now ? Credit card was stolen from a Michael Hicks out of Detroit . He was at home , alive and well today . That 's not our guy . - ( SIGHS ) - (
zone3	phone_ringing ) Son of a bitch . ( SIGHS ) This is Klein . WALKER : Are you looking for me , Detective ? Walker . Where are you ? I 'm very , very close by , funny enough . I need a trace on 415 , caller 's on now . I was actually gon na pop in and ask if you fancied a cup of tea , if you were n't too busy . Yeah , no , not at all , there 's
zone3	Burdon . Sounds really nice , but something tells me there might be a full SWAT team just waiting for me to arrive . Is that how you think this is gon na go down ? Well , to be honest with you , I reckon I 'd get within say 50 feet of the place before you had me cuffed and pinned to the floor . Well , at least that 'll give us time to talk about Ricky Cummins and that night club you tore up last night . That was self-defense . I was attacked . We was nowhere near the night club . If you 're innocent , come in . I 'll help you . What and allow Schuuster to carry on doing what he 's doing ? I do n't think so . There 's nothing to suggest he 's doing anything illegal . And if there was ? If you could pinpoint several murders and executions back to a financial scheme that he himself perpetrated , now what would you do ? Are you in possession of this evidence ? No , but
zone3	( PHONELINEDISCONNECTS ) Not long enough . Let 's go ! ( SIGHS ) (
zone3	tires_screeching ) (
zone3	knocking_on_door ) SAM : So how much time do you think we have ? WALKER : Well , it wo n't take long once you get inside , but listen to me . If anything goes wrong in there I want you to keep your head down and get out as fast as you can , - do you understand that ? - Dad ... Listen , Sam , I 'm serious . Look , I want you to take this . This is a number for a really good mate of mine back in London . I did n't want to tell you , but I 've been saving up since your mom died and all that . But there 's money there for you if anything were to ever happen to me . Thank you , for everything . And you know I love you . - BOTH : Hey . - All right , I 'll see you guys in the car . Yeah . Listen , remember what
zone3	, because you 've got the best vantage point . Right . Remember , lights out , keep your eyes open . Okay . When I give you that signal , when you hear anything going down , I need you to be there . - Understand ? - Yeah . - If anything happens there . - Yeah . Listen , I want to say thanks . I appreciate it . (
zone3	engine_starting ) ( KLEINTYPING ) Whoever sent you this knew exactly what they were doing . Look , it 's all names and numbers to me , kid . - Just show me what you 're telling me . - ( SIGHS ) Take Nicholas Fields here , all right ? MAN : Now when you click on him , this window pops up . Which is everything you 're gon na need if you want to create this . Now meet Nick Fields . He 's got over $30,000 in a checking account several credit cards and a debt-income ratio of 42 percent . So , he makes a variation on the naming convention and then
zone3	got a brand new identity . Exactly . Give me a name , just call something out . Michael Hicks . Michael Hicks , originated out of D-town , he 's got accounts over at Sierra National . Pull him up . - That 's our guy . - Yeah . Is there any way you can determine who created this system ? Yeah , better than that . Now whoever developed this database also added a map to the IP where the server that holds the master key is located . So if you match this address to that server you 're gon na find out who 's controlling everything . Call Judge Booth and get his fat , lazy ass out of bed . I want warrants executed on Most Industries and the estate of Karl Schuuster . We 'll take that fucker down tonight . Where are you going ? ( SIRENWAILINGATADISTANCE ) RICKY : Stop ! Come on , slow down . Oh , my God , thank you so much . Thank you for stopping , my car broke down right here . You have
zone3	've been stuck here ... I need your car , get out . Now pop the trunk , fool . WALKER : Now give me the cap and walk away . Get out ! (

zone3	phone_ringing ) - I 'm gon na take this , guys . - All right . Yeah . Black Escalade , looks like Schuuster 's in for the night . You get those warrants signed ? Got the ADA in there right now , we need more time . Judge is balking at the prelim , says the evidence is too circumstantial . No , it 's because he 's chicken shit . It 's a Beverly Hills address . You tell him to sign that or we 're gon na lose our window of opportunity . - Do it . - All right . (

Rum , you are one lucky , young lady . Because me , I got a world-class recipe for mojitos which I got on my last vacation , more or less . And where was that ? That would be Havana . Yeah , see , Germany does n't do it justice . ( CHUCKLING ) Oh , you know what the key is ? Tell me . - You wo n't tell anyone else . - Never . You got ta use real sugar cane . And you take some dark rum and you float that , see ? The longer you wait , if you have patience , it 'll put a smile on your face . - I bet it will . - ( CHUCKLES ) - Let me go to work . - Please . Do n't you leave . ( CHUCKLES

Every time I come around , that TV is bloody blaring . Surprised the

Uh huh . Just give me a sec . Yeah , take your time . [Ominous_music] I first met Ben at the beach when he was doing nippers . Ben is a good looking kid , but on the cheeky side . When I was younger , my dad would beat me If I did n't do what I was told . I warned Ben one day that he would get into trouble If he did n't stop it . Of course , Ben would n't listen to me . Do n't worry dad , I showed
zone3	. Colin 's really pissing me off With all his nagging . Derek just stands there and let 's him do it . I had to release some pressure . Derek ? Derek ? You alright , mate ? Sorry , I was off with the fairies . Yeah , you seemed to be . Are you here to see me ? No , I was walking past and had a moment , I guess . What 've you got there , mate ? What , this ? Just book work for the surf shop . Never ends , aye . Speaking of book work , I 've got that sketch for you , If you wan na come in and see it ? Is it okay if I come back through the week ? I 've got a lot on today . Sure , no problem . I can drop it down to the store , if you like . Ah , that 's right , I 'm taking off for a week . We can do it when I get back . You sure ? I can go
zone3	minutes . No , I do n't have time today . I 've got to run . Look , I 'll call you when I get back . Alright , I 'll talk to you in a week or so , I guess . Here 's one for ya : Did you hear that story about the Fella on the farm that chopped his arm off , And to stop the bleeding , he used a hot iron ? Is that really possible ? If the iron 's super hot , yeah . You could try cauterizing the wound to stop the bleeding . Probably destroy the tissue though . Plus it 'd hurt like hell ! Must have been a brave man . Would n't someone pass out from the pain though ? The human body can withstand so much pain . Most of us will never have to go through what we 're Truly capable of handling . Thank God . Hey doc , I was watching YouTube the other day and I saw this Footage of a dentist in Germany or something ... He was smoking and
zone3	's teeth out , and jeeze it looked brutal . Yes , I 've seen that one . That is without doubt the roughest dental work I 've ever seen . Ah , the guy in the chair was losing so much blood , Surely it would n't have happened like that , Or he could have at least stopped the bleeding ? Well , there are right ways and wrong ways to extract a tooth . Naturally , we use the proper tools to do it . For example , ah let 's see , this one here is designed to get down Inside the gum . And ah this little baby , which just happens to be my favorite , Is designed to pull the tooth out . How about the days where people were tortured though ? They did n't have all this fancy equipment we have today to keep People awake , or alive for that matter . It 's all about conditioning , mate . Conditioning ? What the hell are you talking about , you piss head ? Well , you know how ,
zone3	first day you run a " k . " Yeah ? Yeah , and if you ran every other day you 'd be able To run further , right ? For sure . Yeah , so torturing someone 's the same . It 's all about conditioning the person 's pain threshold . What they used to do was push you to the limit Where you 'd be about to pass out , then stop . Then come back the next day and push you even further . It 's really a mental tug of war between your brain and the pain . Eventually they 'd pass out , though . Well , how would you wake ' em up if they did pass out ? Its not overly hard , you can get products over the counter to do that . Smelling salts have been around since at least the seventeenth Century to help revive a person that 's passed out . And they work because the ammonia gas irritates the lungs And triggers and inhalation reflex . Which then wakes you up , easy as ! Sounds like
zone3	been a while . Another beer , mate ? Does a bear shit in the woods ? [Laughs] What , have you been throwing down a few ? Ah , I 'm on me fourth . So , when 's the misses get back ? I du n no . Five , six days , maybe a week . Party time at your place ? Hell yeah , has n't stopped mate . Home brew 's the best . Cheers . So , how you going , mate ? You coping with it all okay ? Yeah , I 'd feel a lot better if they just caught the fucker . Yeah . Are the cops even doing anything ? It just seems like they have no leads at all . Yeah , that 's the problem . They have no clue . I do n't think they 'll ever catch who did this . They said they had no forensic evidence . All they have is some old bastard Who saw someone around three A.M . But detective Harris reckons nothing will come of that Because it was too
zone3	Shit , that sucks mate . So did the old guy say anything about what he saw ? Only that the guy he saw looked to be late twenties , early Thirties , but nothing will come of it . This bastard will get away with it . Slow down there , turbo , you do n't wan na injure yourself . Mate , I 'll drink you under the table any day of the week . How about you show me this pool room , and I 'll kick your arse . You 're on . Jeeze , strong brews mate ! You alright there ? Yeah I 'm good , just a little dizzy , that 's all . Is that going to be your excuse when I smash ya ? [Laughs] You wish mate . Thud . Glass breaking [Sound_of_screwing_from_drill] **36;5273;TOOLONG You 're okay , just take your time . Tommy , you ca n't move . You 're bolted down to the table . Oh , I 've performed a tracheotomy on you So you ca n't talk either . It 's amazing what you can
zone3	you can talk is if I block that hole . I would n't go throwing your head around either . There are pretty sharp spikes pointed at your skull . I reckon it 'd hurt a lot if you hit em ' . **25;5311;TOOLONG Now , what are you trying to say ? [Gargling_stops] What are you doing ? Ah ! Come off it tom , do n't act like you do n't know ! If you tell me the truth right now , I 'll let you go . Truth about what ? I 'm going to give you one more chance to tell me the truth . This is it . If the next words outta ' your mouth are not what I want to hear , well fuck ya then . So you wan na confess ? What have I done ? You know what pisses me off the most About having a pool table ? People always spill crap on them and wreck the felt . Look what you have done , Tommy . You are bleeding on my table . Shit . Well now I
zone3	... [Tommy_screaming_and_gasping] I did it . You did what ? I killed her . I have your diary , I know exactly what you did to my Daughter , you sick prick . She was six years old . You killed Georgia because you where mad at Colin and me . What the fuck is wrong with you ? And she was n't the only one . You 're a child killer , rapist , pedophile . You 're scum ! Do n't bother Tommy . I cut out your throat So I did n't have to listen to your dribble . How old was Georgia ? She was six . For every year she was alive you 're going to get tortured For a whole day . Six years equals six days . And when I say tortured , I mean I 'm going to cause you so Much fucking pain you 'll wish you were never born ! You are not my brother ! The only thing I wan na hear coming out of your mouth is you Yelling from the pain I 'm causing you . That
zone3	you down for a while . I 'm going to see Colin . You just stay there , and I 'll be back soon . You seem in good spirits today ! Do I ? That week off seems to have done you a world of good . What 'd you get up to ? I rebuilt my pool room . Looks good now . So we 're on for a pool comp soon then ? Hell yeah ! I 'm ordering new felt for the old girl next week . Once I have that , we 'll get into it . So , when 're you coming back to the shop ? Hmm , give me a few more days . I have a few things to finish up . Then I 'm all yours . Good to have you back , mate . Take all the time you need . Now I have a story for you Tommy . I really do n't think you 're going to wan na hear it , But I 'm going to tell you anyway . It 's about that little boy
zone3	the shopping centre . Did you ever hear about that little boy ? Ah , it 's a sad story really . This little boy was shopping with his mother . Then the next thing you know , he 's gone . Taken by two ten year old boys . They took him down to the train tracks And did the most horrific things to him . They even cut off his fingers . When I read this , Tommy , after losing Georgia , I really felt for that family . So for the sake of justice I 'm gon na cut off your fingers . One at a time . Hold that thought ! Nearly forgot the wax ! Need to make sure this wax is melted So you do n't bleed everywhere . This will be a lot easier if you do n't move . [Tommy_screaming] Okay , okay ! I 've stopped . I do n't know why you 're upset . I only cut off two of your fingers ! Now the wax is to stop the bleeding ... But it wo n't stick with
zone3	. [Phone_ringing] Good timing ! Mum 's calling . Mother ! Tommybangingontable , plastic , mufflednoi ... Nah , just waxing some stuff . Yeah sure , what time where you thinking ? Okay cool . See ya then , yeah ... I better finish this waxing . I love you too . Mum and dad are coming to visit . I better get organized . [Tommy_moaning] Do n't worry , I 'll bring you down some food . Ca n't have you starving to death on me . I got a call from that detective the other day . What did he have to say ? It 's been nearly six months . Not too much as usual , apparently some old guy saw Someone around three a , m , walking out of fishers point . Although it was dark , the cops are getting a sketch artist to Draw up a picture of what the old fart saw . ( [Laughs] ) Do n't say that . Hey dad , do you remember That girl that was killed , uh , shit , like twelve years ago
zone3	. Is that who you mean ? Yeah , that 's the one , what 'd they do to her killer in jail again ? Jeeze son , I ca n't really remember . Hang on , just got ta put my washing in the dryer . Be back in a second . Got ta love clothes dryers . I was just saying that we should get going , Your father wants to watch the footy . I just remembered what they did to that guy in prison . Really ? Hey , Tommy you awake ? I was just chatting with dad upstairs , and He told me what he wants me to do to you for killing Georgia . So tomorrow we 'll do dad 's idea , just to make him happy . You know how he 's always got ta throw his two Bob 's worth in . Righto , well I 'm off to bed . We have a big day tomorrow . What 'd you say ? Just kill me . Oh , I will kill you mate , do n't you worry about

It 's kinda weird , but okay ! ( Laughing ) Aye ? Night bro ! Hey Tommy ! Check this out . Guess where this is going to go . What ? No idea ? Up your arse , mate ! Hey , do n't panic ! I have lube . You do n't think I 'd just ram it up there , do you ? Now your probably wondering why I wan na stick a pipe up your Arse right ? Well that 's where this comes into it . See I 'm going to stick the barbed wire up the pipe and into Your guts . Then I 'm going to remove the tube and leave it up there . You excited ? I am ! I told you we had a big day ahead of us . I enjoyed killing her ... What
zone3	'm sorry . I hope this fucking hurts , you little prick . Oh , this is sharp shit . I bet you wish I used lube now . Please Derek , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . We seem to be stuck ! I wonder if it 's your guts . Or if it 's the pipe . Hey Colin ! How 's business ? Yeah , things are picking up . What can I do for you ? I 'm just here to see Derek . We have a sketch for him to look at . Ah yeah he mentioned you had a witness or something . He 's not actually in today , he 's got a few days off . Ah , we 'll find him at home then ? Definitely . He 's working on a pool room . Really good for him . Giving him something to do , you know . That 's great . Uh , actually , While we 're here , could you have a look at this sketch ? Sure , anything to
zone3	you ? Thanks for your help . Come on , wake up , Tommy . Oy Tommy , can you hear me ? [Gargling_from_tracheotomy] Oh thank God ! I thought I might have lost you there for a minute . Might have pushed you a bit hard yesterday ... What does n't kill you , right ? Ca n't have you nodding off and missing everything . Screaming , **28;5338;TOOLONG ... Yep , might have to do that in sections , mate . While we wait , how about we read a little ? Recognize this ? There are three stories in here I think we need To seriously discuss , do n't you ? And to save us time I 've highlighted the important parts . Let 's talk about little Ben . He was ten years old , Tommy . What would make any man want to hurt a ten year old boy ? Do you know I 've met Ben 's older sister ? Let me tell you , she is pissed off . She 'd cause you a lot of pain too , but well ,
zone3	'll need to do it for her . Now you say you broke his knees so he could n't run away . Well , I did some research on knee breaking . And I thought you 'd appreciate this ! I found the plans on Google . The knee splitter . [Sound_of_metal_grinding] So for little Ben and his older sister , I made one just for you . What 's say we try this baby out ? Tommybreathingfaster , plasticrustling **37;5368;TOOLONG ... [Tommy_screaming] Do n't you dare pass out , you coward ! You can handle it ! Ben was ten years old when you smashed his knee caps ! It 's all about conditioning , remember ? You can take it ! You think this is bad ? Wait ' til you see what's coming , this is nothing tom ! I loved you , you were my brother , and all along you were The worst scum of the earth . You fucking disgust me . You still have two days left to pay for what you did . You piece of shit ! Suck it up !
zone3	baby , I 'm teaching him a lesson . Uncle Tommy is a bad man . Does it make you feel happy to hurt Uncle Tommy ? No baby , hurting people is bad , But sometimes really bad people deserve to be punished . Daddy , you said when people are bad to call the policeman , and The policeman will put them in jail . I just want Uncle Tommy to never forget What he has put us through , Then daddy will call the police . Promise ? Yes baby , I promise . I love you , daddy . I love you too , baby girl . I come down here to give you a drink And look what you 've done to yourself , Tommy . Seriously Houdini , what 's the plan of attack here ? Shred your last good hand getting loose , then you have to Free your head from those spikes , which is pretty bloody hard even For me , and I made the fucker ! After all that , you have to free your ankles . Then what ?
zone3	feet of barbed wire Sticking out of your arse ? How the fuck did you get away with murder ? Mmm . That 's right , you did n't . [Coughing] Well I guess this hand 's got ta go ! Please , Derek . Do n't bother ! [Door_bell_rings] Who the hell is that ? Some people have bad timing . Might be around the back ? [Door_bell_rings] Okay , okay , settle down , I 'm comin ' . Ah Michael , how 's things ? Morning Derek , sorry to bother you . Got a few minutes ? Yeah sure , come in . Excuse the mess . Sit down guys , you want a coffee or something ? Ah , no thanks . We wo n't hold you up . We called into the store to see you , but , ah , Colin said you were having a few days off . Yeah that 's right , taking a few more days , Then heading back in next week . So what 's this about , do you have some news for me ? Actually
zone3	shop Yesterday to show you this . When Colin saw it , he thought it looked exactly like your Brother Thomas . Detective Harris ! Detective Harris ( Raspy ) [Coughing] I guess it looks like Tommy a little . Wait , you do n't think Tommy 's the guy who did this ? Well , no , but we certainly would like to talk to him . We dropped into his house the other day , but he was n't there . You heard from him at all lately ? [Tommy_crying] Derek , have you heard from him ? Um no , no , um , Tommy does his own thing . Although mum and dad did ask me the other night When they were over if I 'd seen him . I think he went away with his girlfriend . She 's a photographer and had a job out west . I tried to call her but she had no reception . Fair enough . Do you know when they 're getting back ? Saturday or Sunday I believe ? Okay well , I think that 's all
zone3	you do hear from your brother , Tell him to give me a call . [Choking] Now , let 's talk about kelsie . What 'd she ever do to you ? What was it about her that made you take her out to The bush to rape and kill her ? The part that really gets me is that you had a beautiful Girlfriend and you chose to rape a fifteen year old girl . And to think , sian said she 'd want you in jail . Pedophiles get what ? Couple of years , then they 're let out to do it again ? Not really effective , is it ? Perhaps you 'd like to see what it feels like to be raped ? [Coughing] Pease Derek . Did that hurt ? Did that hurt ? If you do n't answer me , I 'll do it again ! Did that hurt ? ( Raspy ) Yes ! Now you know how kelsie felt ! I see our conditioning is coming along quite well . Might be time to push it up a notch . There
zone3	by his stepfather . Ya ' know how he did it ? He put the phone book on him , like this . Then beat him with a hammer . Now you ca n't tell me that hurt . I think you can take more ! Now that 's got ta hurt ! I bet you 're finding it hard to breathe ! I need a break , Tommy ! This is hard work ! You have a rest . We have a lot to get to In the next 24 hours . Tomorrow we talk about Georgia , but today , Well , today it 's about kelsie . I have a question for you Tommy . You going to tell me the truth ? Water ! Sure , but then you 'll tell me what I wan na know . Deal ? Yes . That 's enough . Now as you can tell , I have a hammer , And this time there is no phone book . You mess me around I 'll crack you with this hammer . Where is kelsie 's body ? Speak .
zone3	. We used to play there as kids . So if I was to call the cops right now and tell them To head out there , they 'll find her body , right ? Yes , buried under an old steel pile . That was n't so hard , and I did n't have to hit you . That 's for raping and killing her ! I have some information on a missing 15 year old girl , Her name is kelsie Taylor , her body can be found under a pile Of steel behind an old cane shed just off the Bruce highway . North of the sunshine coast . You ca n't miss the cane farm . Good luck . Look at the master at work . What 're you building , Georgia ? A sand castle . Maybe we could live there one day ? No we can't , silly Billy . Why ca n't we live there ? Because it 's made out of sand ! You 're so smart baby . How much do you love daddy ? Daddy , you know how much
zone3	you , the professional . [Tommy_gargling_in_his_sleep] [Sound_of_tape_ripping] " I opened her window and climbed inside . " I knew about the window from Derek telling me how Stacy Would n't let him fix it . I picked up Georgia out of her bed . She woke slightly and I told Her it 's okay , it 's Uncle Tommy . Go back to sleep . I climbed out the window with her . She woke again and I said we were going to see her dad And for her to go back to sleep . I took her up the road to my car and laid her on the back seat . I do n't know why , Georgia . I did n't really want to take her , but I was so angry at Derek For firing me and choosing her and Colin over me . I wanted to get him back . I took her down to the beach . I knew she loved the beach . My intention was to drown her , But she woke up and started crying . I could n't shut her up
zone3	again . No matter what I said to calm her it was always , ' I want my daddy , Uncle Tommy I want my daddy . ' Drove me insane . " So I hit her . " You sat there every day saying how much you loved Georgia And our family . I ca n't believe such lies came out of your mouth . So that 's what we 're going to start with first . What are you going to do ? Before I could n't hear you scream , Now I can hear every noise you make . That 's for all the bullshit you dribbled to me , My daughter , and my family . I think it 's time this has to go . You took my daughter 's right hand ... An eye for an eye . No ! No ! Please Derek , I 'm sorry ! **25;5407;TOOLONG [Tommy_screaming] [Flesh_and_bone_grinding] [Blow_torch_being_lit] [Door_bell_rings] [Door_bell_rings] Hey mate . - I got him , mate . - Got who ?

Please . I got ta go . That 's detective Harris here now . I 've got to go speak to him . I do n't know what's happened , Tanya . Just give your mum a call , and I 'll see you when you get here .

Okay , calm down . Listen to me , is he armed ? Armed ? Does he have a weapon ? Ah , he 's got a knife . Okay , is Tommy still alive ? Look , put it this way , if

Sam , call for back-up and make sure they 're on their way . I 'm going in to talk to Derek . Derek , do n't leave me like this , just kill me . Derek ! Do n't do anything stupid , mate ! I 'm coming down ! Stay there . I mean it . Stay where you are . [Crying] Go ! Clear ! Go ! No , Tommy , I 'll do my time for torturing you , But you will always be the murderer in this family .

We steel ourselves for a season of pandemonium . But after the initial celebrations , nothing really happens . Somehow our crappy Saturday job at the meatworks becomes full-time . And then Christmas comes and so do the dreaded exam results . The news is not good . A few of our classmates pack their bags for university and shoot through , and suddenly there we are ... Biggie and me , heading to work every morning in the frigid wind in the January of our new lives . Some days I can see me and Biggie out there as old codgers , anchored to the friggin ' place . Beside me , Biggie 's face gets darker and darker . ( HORNSOUNDSDISTANTLY ) When the shift horn sounds , he lurches away , his last canon half-empty . " Fuck it , " he says . " We 're outta here . "

The plan is to call from somewhere the other side of the city , when we 're out of reach . I want to be safe from the guilts . The old girl will crack a sad on me . But Biggie has bigger things to fear . His old man will beat the shit out of him when he finds out . I ca n't tell Biggie this , but missing out on uni really stings . When the results came , I cried my eyes out . I thought about killing myself . Biggie 's results were even worse than mine . He 'd really fried . But he did n't have his heart set on doing well . He could n't give a rat 's ring . In his head , he 's always seen himself at the meatworks or the cannery , until he inherits a salmon netting license from his old
zone3	's not the brightest crayon in the box but he 's the most loyal person I know . He 's the real deal . We did n't meet until the second week of high school . I was new in town and right from the start , a kid called Tony Macoli became fixated on me . That 's how it started ... a single decisive act of violence that joined me to Biggie forever . If you believe him on the subject , he acted more out of animal irritation than charity . But I felt like somebody ransomed and set free . Biggie became my mate , my constant companion . Friendship , I suppose , comes at a price . There have been girls I 've disqualified myself from because of Biggie . Not everyone wants to have him tagging along everywhere . Right through high school , I had occasional moments , evenings , encounters with girls , but no real girlfriend , and mostly I do n't regret it . Except for Briony Nevis . For two years , we 're sort of watching each
zone3	flat-out beautiful . Long , black hair . Glossy skin . Dark eyes . I kiss her once at a party . Well , maybe she kisses me . But there , out of the corner of my eyes , Biggie , alone on the smoky veranda waiting to go home . I do n't go to him straight up . I do make him wait a fair old while . But I do n't go on with Briony Nevis the way I badly want to because I know Biggie will be left behind ... for good . We pull in to fuel up and use the phone . Biggie decides he 's not calling home , so he sits in the VW while I reverse the charges and get an earful . I hang up and find Biggie talking to a chick with a backpack the size of an elephant saddle . She 's tall and not very beautiful with long , shiny brown hair and big knees . She thinks she 's on the coast road north and she 's mortified to discover otherwise . I can see
zone3	There is n't really even much consultation . We just pull out with this chick in the back . Meg is her name . Meg is as thick as a box of hammers . It 's alarming to see how enthralled Biggie is . And I just drive and try to avoid the rear-view mirror . While I 'm thinking about all of this , Biggie 's gone and climbed over into the back and Meg 's lit up a number and they 're toking away on it with their feet up like I 'm some kind of chauffeur . Biggie 's never had much luck with girls . I should be glad for him . But I 'm totally pissed off . We come upon a maze of salt lakes that blaze silver and pearly in the sun . I begin to have the panicky feeling that the land and this very afternoon might go on forever . ( TRAINCROSSINGSIGNALRINGS ) Biggie 's really enjoying himself back there . I slowly understand why . There 's the obvious thing , of course ... the fact that he 's in
zone3	something else ... the thing that eats at me ... is the way he 's enjoying being brighter than her , being a step ahead . Feeling somehow senior and secure in himself . It 's me all over . It 's how I am with him . And it 's not pretty . The kombi fills up with smoke again . But this time it 's bitter and metallic and I understand we 're on fire . Without an extinguisher , there 's not much we can do , once we 're standing out there in the litter of our belongings , waiting for the VW to explode . But it just smoulders and hisses awhile as the sun sinks behind us . In the end , with the smoke almost gone and the wiring cooked , it 's obvious we 're not going anywhere . We turn our attention to the sunset . Meg rolls another spliff . We do n't say anything . The sun flattens itself against the salt pan and disappears . The sky goes all acid-blue and there 's just this huge silence .
zone3	, I ca n't imagine an end to the quiet . The horizon fades . Everything looks impossibly far off . In two hours , I 'll hear Biggie and Meg in his sleeping bag . She 'll cry out like a bird and become so beautiful , so desirable in the total dark that I 'll begin to cry . TIM WINTON AND BOY : In a week , Biggie and Meg will blow me off in Broome and I 'll be on the bus south for a second chance at the exams . TIM WINTON : In a year , Biggie will be dead in a mining accident in the Pilbara and I 'll be reading Robert Louis Stevenson at his funeral . Meg wo n't show . I 'll grow up and have a family of my own and see Briony Nevis , tired and lined in a supermarket queue and wonder what all the fuss was about . All of it unimaginable . Right now , standing with Biggie on the salt lake at sunset , I do n't care what happens beyond this moment .

It is the 19th of October , 18 ... never be believed , I feel the events I am experiencing must be recorded . Perhaps one day ... they will be understood . It all began with the death of Nathaniel . He was no less of a son to me . She may have bore him , but
zone3	. We were coming home across the causeway . The horse somehow lost its footing . The carriage was thrown into the marsh . She saw it happen from the nursery . He sank so fast . Before I knew it , he was lost . Gone . She blames me . So that I may suffer Nathaniel 's death again and again , she makes me watch so I can see what she saw , - feel what she felt . - ... felt . See what I saw . Get away from me , Jennet . Feel what I felt . I 'm imagining you . You 're not real . So Jennet was Nathaniel 's mother , but Alice brought him up . Until he drowned . That 's what I heard . The carriage falling into the marsh . I must be going mad . No . No , I believe you saw someone , and I believe that something happened here . But we 've looked everywhere on the island . I know where I 've seen these letters before . The village . I

I need to concentrate . We were shot down over the sea . My crew were trapped in the fuselage as it went under . I could hear them calling to me . I tried to swim back down to them , but ... it was so dark . Could n't breathe properly . - I 'm sure it was n't ... - No , it was . They were my crew . I was the only survivor . So now I do n't like the water . How did you get this ? Tom had it in his pocket the night he died . How did you get it back ? - Get out the way . - James , get off ! Hello ? Hello ? Edward ?

You were brought up thinking Alice Drablow was your mother , - But she is not . " - But she is not . Your father , Charles Drablow , got me pregnant . This is the truth . Please believe it . I will never let you go . So , please , come to me as soon as you can , for I was , am , and always shall be your mother . - Jennet Humfrye . - " Jennet Humfrye . " He died two days later .

I do n't want you here a moment longer . No ! I wo n't leave them here . I found Joyce today trying to strangle herself . Do n't you see ? You 're poisoning them . That was Jennet ! Do n't you see ? She 's been seen . We ca n't leave . We need to get the children to the cellar . Now . That 's right , come along . Quick as you can . - Come along . Come along . Girls . - Be careful . Stay away from the glass . Be careful . It 's OK . Nobody deserves to suffer like she did . Why has this got to you ? Eve ? I had a child . A son . I was n't married . I was too young
zone3	. Where did you ... ? Where did you ... ? Let me see him , please . I tried looking for him , but ... they would n't tell me where he was . Or his name . After a while , I just gave up . I let him go . Eve . We ca n't let the past pull us under . There 's just too much to do . Too much to live for , right ? She knows . No , this has got nothing to do with her . She told me , " You let him go . " That was for Alice . Remember ? She said she blamed her for Nathaniel 's death . Made her watch it over and over again . This has got nothing to do with you . - You 're wrong . - Eve , you need to listen to me . She wants to take something away from me . What ? She wants to turn him against me . - Everybody , stay together . - It 's only a draft . Edward ,

And not a whole hell of a lot else until the casino racket in the mid ' 80s . Let 's try this part again . My name 's Ivan . Richie Furst . It 's a pleasure , Richie . Welcome aboard . This is The House . I never in a million years thought I 'd have something like this . Just got to the point where me and my old partner , Alex Maynard , looked in the ATM account and realized we had so much money that it was morally incumbent on us to buy something . So , we ordered a set of these boats . We had a good time . A lot of fun . Is he still involved ? No . Alex , um ... You know , this life has a lot of temptation . And it just gets a hold of some people
zone3	than three years ago . He was a good guy . He was my ... He was my best friend . Why The House ? Because the house always wins . Which is why we do n't have to cheat people . We have the greatest business model in the world . 50,000 players , three cents a second , average rake . That 's just poker , okay ? The rest of the site we 're doing $1.2 to $1.9 million a day . That translates into $750,000 net profit per day . But the math is right . Am I missing something ? No , you did n't miss anything . We missed something . We had a couple of our programmers who decided it would be a good idea to write a backdoor into the code so that they could see player 's hole cards . And they cheated you . And they cheated other players . And I 'm really sorry and I 'm embarrassed . And that has nothing to do with what this company and what this site stand for . You saw it
zone3	why they 're on airplanes to wherever the fuck donkeys from Compliance come from . But you came to me . You did n't tell anybody else . Because you know rumors of cheating and bullshit can affect these sites like fucking bedbugs and you can never get rid of it . That took a lot of balls . Honestly , I could n't get to you any other way . Regardless , I 'm very grateful . I am nothing if not world-class at showing my gratitude so we have checked you in to one of our company 's executive luxury penthouse suites and your account has been credited with the amount of money that you lost . I do n't know what to say . Thank you . Thank you . Just do me a favor and do n't try to win your tuition online again , okay ? How do you know about that ? How do you think I know ? Studying my player history , ran it through your algorithm , saw that I was playing way above my mean . No , none of
zone3	Look , Richie , I understand why you did what you did . I know about what happened with that job on Wall Street . You were trying to get rich , and you were trying to be respectable . And you would have , if you had another year and a half . Those people took your labor ... And my fucking money . And your fucking money , and they burned it all up . And now you 're fucked . Because Wall Street 's a different place . The rules have changed . The odds of getting a job at a good hedge fund on Wall Street are roughly the same as hitting runner-runner flush in a hand of Texas Hold ' Em . You probably know what the odds of hitting a runner-runner flush in Texas Hold ' Em are , do n't you ? Roughly four percent . Roughly four percent . Well , listen , I put a little something extra in here for your troubles . That will get you through your Masters . I think that ends our business here . Unless

I have met very few people in my career who I think can be really , really exceptional at this . And you are one of those people . The most important rule in the world is that nobody gives you shit . You want to do something in this fucking life , you go out and build it . What do you say ? Is it Newark , or you stick around here with me ? What do you think ? I think any question that starts with " Either are you back to Jersey or ' X ' " , the correct answer is " X " . I was in . And I took to it like a gambler 's son . He gave me the full run of the plac . I started right in tuning up the affiliate business . I learned about payment processing , off-shore banking . He even let me bring in my own people .

Well , almost everything . This is a good one to bet on . His name is Ojo Rojo . Mister Herrera . Paid in total . With dollars , as you wanted What was once paid in full is now only half . Next time bring 500 . Here we go . You might find this hard to believe because of how welcoming my country can be , but some of my colleagues in the legislature believe your kind is ruining Costa Rica . Me doing damage ? I 'm a fountain of money in this shithole . I put millions into your economy . I give employment to hundreds of people , with better salaries than you can pay . I understand , that 's exactly what I tell them . But they go on and on about how the gringos and their online gaming money attracts undesirables , breeds prostitution
zone3	already ? Who knows ? If I give someone 5.7 million dollars in three and a half years , I notice it . And in return , I expect more than advice on a horse . I want stability . Listen to me . You have stability and you know it . We 've been a democracy for over 50 years because we do n't give the people a reason to unseat us . And the people of this country would love nothing more than to haul an American in as the face of corruption . So , that 's why it 's gon na cost you more money . Good luck with the horse . All I had to do was make sure the numbers added up and maybe shave the player edge here or there , 0.8 for blackjack , 0.6 for craps and 3.4 for poker , everybody was happy . Hey . There he is . Ivan . Thanks for having me , man . What do you think ? Uh , crazy . It 's a little over the top , but what are you
zone3	. I just ca n't catch a fucking break . What are you crying about ? You dropped three grand . You 'll pick it up later tonight . It 's like they want me to lose . Yeah , that 's why they build casinos . No roll . Shooter , you ca n't slide the dice . No roll ? Fuck you , pay the bet . Sir ? Pay the bet , you fucking greaseball . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Hey , hey , hey . Take it easy , man . The stickman is just trying to do his job . He fucks up again , he 's gon na have that stick up his ass . Why do n't you let me take over ? Ladies and gentlemen , the point is still eight . Get your hard ways in while the dice are in the middle . Oh , that 's great , Zorro , work the stick . Guess you do n't have the stones to play . How about this ? I 'll fade your action . Just me ,
zone3	? How about that ? If this goes bad , I may need some credit . Will 30K cover it ? We 'll call it an advance . Hey , shooter , try to hit that back wall . Believe me , she 'll appreciate it . What shot Jesse James ? A 45 . Centerfield . Press it . All the hard ways . Shooter wants to press it . Shooter , shooter . Six , the hard way . If he does n't roll a seven and crap out , this is gon na cost you 100 grand . The house ca n't sweat the money . Hey , shooter , do me a favor . I 'm thinking of a number . That 's the number . Let 's go . Thanks for playing . You know what ? You forgot the eternal truth . The house always wins . That was pretty impressive . That was pretty lucky . Thanks for backing me . It was business . No thanks needed . This is a single malt . It 's really good . You should try
zone3	pizza and beer guy myself . Baked potato with cheese and baked beans . And look at us now . Look at you . Wow . You really do wear it . Is this how you worked Ivan over ? I did n't work him over . You know , part of my job is getting close to the people who are close to my employer . So , that 's it ? Just checking me out professionally . Pretty much . " Pretty much . " Good luck , sir . It 's the casino toss . You know how at the casino when they give you chips they say " Good luck , sir " ? They do n't tell you that " sir " means " dummy " , and " good luck " means " fuck you " . Holy shit . Those are fucking crocodiles . Yeah . This guy wants me to invest in a crocodile farm for their skin . He sent me these as samples . Ivan ... Mmm ? I appreciate the invite , man . Tonight was a blast .
zone3	. I did n't have fun , I fucking hated it . I do n't know why . It used to be fun . Started out , it was fun . Fuck . Started out , it was the greatest thing in the world . It 's like everything you ever thought you wanted when you were 13 years old . Listen , I got a guy , he 's coming in from London . His name is Brett Sheck . We call him " Shecky . " He 's a super affiliate . His players would represent over 10 percent of our business . Okay . Currently , he 's with these pussies at Ultimate Bet . I think you can sign him . If you do , it 's gon na be on for you . Because you 're going to commission everything you bring in . And that 's when the real exponential money starts . And I 'm excited to see you spend it . You up for it ? I 'm on it . All right . Good . You want to throw one ?
zone3	want to throw one . I love those little slimy bastards . They remind me of everybody who wants to take a piece out of me . Looks like somebody made a new friend . - Yeah , I did . - Well ... Good . You want me to stay away . No . I want you to do whatever you want . God knows I do . Hmm . You certainly do . Get some rest , yeah ? You called him on cheating you and got yourself a job . I think that deserves a round of applause . What is this ? Who the fuck are you ? If I un-cuff you , you 're not gon na do anything stupid , like run ? Because I 'll shoot you . The FBI is in the kidnapping business now ? I do whatever I want . Man , I 'm in fucking Costa Rica . Look , I wanted to get you alone and I did n't want your boss to see us together . You should be thanking me . My name is Eric Shavers
zone3	me " Agent Shavers . " And you work for me now . Can we just back up for a fucking second here ? Like I said , you caught him cheating . But what about ... What about bribing an official ? What about racketeering ? What about stealing the player list from his former job to start his new website , Midnight Black ? Now , there 's rumblings that he wants new territories . You are gon na be my guy inside . I do n't know what you think I can do , man . I 'm an independent marketing consultant . Look , do n't play me for stupid ! You 're too smart for that . I 'm too smart for that . You could have worked at any respectable place . Any legitimate casino . Caesars Palace . That 's a nice place . But you chose to sign up with Ivan Block . I 'm not even a principal in the fucking company . I can go wherever I want . You ca n't go to New Jersey . Or any place
zone3	York . What the fuck have I done in New Jersey , huh ? Or New York , for that matter ? You 're not that bright for a Princeton man . It 's sad . I was talking to my associate , Agent Mohr , and he has a sworn statement from a Dean Monroe that says you were promoting gambling at Princeton . Now , if you were my guy , I could make it all go away . Wipe the slate clean . But if the sun comes up tomorrow and you 're still here , and you 're not my guy then I pull the trigger . And you can forget about working on Wall Street or any legitimate casino . Because you need a license for that , and felons do n't get them . See , I can stand here and say I 'm doing it because it 's my job . Or I 'm upholding the law , blah-blah-fucking-blah . But the truth is , I 'm doing it because I enjoy it . Hmm ? I love fucking over Princeton guys .
zone3	it 's important . Oh ! Ivan ! I need to talk to you . What 's up ? Fuck , I 'm so fucking terrible at this game , man . They only let me play because I own the team . I just fucking got kidnapped by the FBI . Good . Oh , that 's good ? Oh , I knew they 'd hit on you sometime , I just did n't know what you 'd do . Now I do . Is it that guy Shavers ? Did he give you the line about how I 'm a bad guy , you got ta leave town , all that shit ? Yeah , he 's threatened me with jail . He said I 'd be barred from re-entering the country . Listen , you 're not gon na go to jail , okay ? You got grabbed up by the FBI . I get it . That 's really fucking scary . I was terrified the first time it happened to me . if you want to get on a plane and just get the fuck
zone3	Are you doing something wrong ? Are we ? I make it possible for a fat guy in Cleveland to play Omaha Hi-Lo in his underwear in his living room . Shoot me . I mean , these fucking shoe companies , they pay a Chinese eight-year-old two nickels to hand-stitch these fucking things till their fingers bleed , then they sell them in the ghetto in the United States for $250 . And I 'm the fucking criminal ? Then why is this guy all over me , huh ? Why is he fucking with me ? Because he 's jealous . He 's , hating on you , that 's why . He sees what you have , he sees what you 're gon na have , and he 's plugging away in a bad suit and heavy shoes for chump change . Look , man , even if it was a crime , there 's nothing they could do about it because they do n't have enough jurisdiction to write us a fucking parking ticket down here . Richie , I look at you , and I
zone3	" look in your eye . You 've been beat up , you 've been knocked down , you 've been kicked around , you 've been told you were n't good enough , and you have something to prove . Now is the time to do it . But let me know . Either way , someone 's got to deal with Shecky . Block is a one man industry , Shecky . He figured out how to take online gambling and make it sexy , with the money and the women . Because that 's the true crave-able experience . Know what I crave ? Name it . Thirty-three percent rake-back on my poker players and cost per acquisition on my casino gamers . We 're at 30 percent and rev-share . Well , I 'm getting my terms at UB and they 're happy to have me , so , I think I 'm gon na stay where I am . Tell you what , give me a day . I 'll talk to him about matching , we 'll lock this thing up . All right
zone3	I got to get home , my wife and I are about to have our first kid . Ah . Salud . Cheers . Ivan . I spoke with Sheck . Yeah ? A few little things and we 're pagando blackjack . What few little things ? He wants an extra three points rake-back and to stay at cost per acquisition . I know it 's not the original deal , but , uh , we still make a huge profit . No . Fuck him . If we give him that , every piker who thinks he 's an affiliate is gon na want the same thing . No . Then I do n't think we get him . Well , then I guess that 's it , you do n't want the bonus . You know what I mean ? Pack your shit . No , no , no . Ivan , wait . I 've got this . Tell me how much room I have to negotiate . You have no room to negotiate . You already tried negotiating . Now , you try leverage .
zone3	Find out what that is . Then you got ta do the hard thing . That little voice in the back of your head right now ? It 's not your conscience . It 's fear . Hey , man . How you doing ? Thanks for hanging in there , giving me the day . How could I pass up the chance for marlin ? Are we good to go ? Just got to wait for the crew to board . Who 's this guy ? Oh , he drives the boat . Here comes your crew . Permission to come aboard ? God , I love that accent . Permission granted . Come on , girls . Look , man . Eat , drink , fish . Compliments of Ivan Block . He 's not gon na match the UB terms , but we do want you to think of us as friends so , if you ever decide to switch , we 'll be your first call . Have fun . I 'll try . Hi . Well , hi . I 'm a fucking idiot .
zone3	. I ca n't blame you , you 're nothing . I 've got everything . I 've got a great wife , a baby on the way , a business . And I 've got to come to Costa Rica and act like an asshole . I 'm sure Block 's gon na press the terms now . No , actually , the terms are the same one's we offered you . Block wants you to feel great about working with us . Question is , where am I gon na be working ? You can still work in London . Yeah , but will my checks be coming from a Costa Rican bank , or Caymans , or Malta , or somewhere else ? I 've heard the whispers . Block 's not too popular around these parts anymore . One of the reasons I was gon na stay away . Player list . My man . You got it ? Got it . You 're a fucking genius . Come here , watch this . Wilson , can you get 30 racks ? 500,000 new international players

We 'll lose some of them , but luckily , we got Shecky out there bringing them back for us , so , we 're gon na be all right . And this is my thanks to you . It 's a little bonus to show how much we appreciate you . You 're a fucking man and you did what you had to do . Spend it all in one place . Knock yourself out . Do some degenerate shit . Do it in my car . Which one ? Whichever one you want . Thanks , Richie . You 're a good man . Richie . Honestly , this is the greatest night of my life , man . I ca n't thank you enough . You do n't look like you 're having any fun . You know , we , uh , ca n't do this . If you like me , what 's the problem ? You know what the problem
zone3	you a car . Mmm . Immediately . Get you out of here . Mmm-hmm . I think that 's the best idea . My father described this place as a gambler 's paradise . But to be honest , I never really put too much stock into what my father had to say , ever . Especially about gambling . Well , as a gaming professional , that 's exactly the type of customer I want in the world . You would love him then . But as your friend , I 'm sorry . As my friend ? Let 's just ... No . No , you 're right . Let 's not get too excited , okay ? No , no , no . Too strong . Um , wrong word . " Colleague . " Much better . I can work with that . How do you get used to all this ? Well ... There was no " all this " when we came here . We built it all , Ivan and I . So , you two were together ? It was a

What a night , huh ? Crazy . Yeah , fun ride , Richie . I 'm out . Out to where ? Out to home . I 'm all the way out . What are you talking about ? Tell him , Pet . Just tell him . Tell me . I 'm leaving my girl 's hotel room this morning when this real hard-ass , Agent **29;6420;TOOLONG , from the FBI , rolls up on me , tells me I 'm breaking U.S . fiduciary ... I got braced , too . Same guy , same speech . You could tell him to kiss your ass . He ca n't touch us down here . He said some scary shit about Block . He 's a government functionary , Pet . That 's what they do . Block
zone3	. Who gives a shit what he says ? He told me I could be barred from re-entering the country if I did n't leave now . So , what are you gon na do , try and re-open your skin ? My brother owns a broker-dealer , he offered me a job . Wall Street ? I 'll be rich , not super-rich . I can deal . What the fuck ? What ? Oh . I hide it in there from the maids . They hate bran . They eat everything else in the kitchen , but they do n't eat the bran . Do me a favor . Invest it for me . I just do n't have time to spend it while I 'm here . I 'm in a basement all day . You should come with . No . I 'm finally in the real shit , optimizing the platform . That 's where the real money 's at . To be honest , super-rich works for me . Richie , I understand the path you 're on . But you should pack it
zone3	hoss . My future is here . All right , hoss . See you . - Hello . - Young Richie ! I got something I need you to do . It 's gon na be a crash course in client relations . Ivan . Excuse me , Richie . I 'm sorry , what 's the problem ? Send someone else . Why would I do that ? You do n't have any personal feelings in this . Please . Okay , look , here 's what I need you to do . Meet Wilson at the casino . Wilson will give you a k . You are gon na use that key to go to the cage and open box 765 . You are gon na remove the contents of that box . 300 racks . Domestic . I want you to give what 's inside that briefcae to Mr . Herrera . He 's the gaming commissioner , which makes him Caesar in this country . Without him , we ca n't operate . My friend . How are you doing ? Good , how are you
zone3	hug . I want you to meet a magical unicorn . Very rare . Would you like to partake ? I 'm fine , thank you . Okay . Come have a seat . Sit . Sit . Let me show you something . Let 's talk about the ... Right ? It 's something else . First class . Not coach . First class . It 's a very nice gesture . I 'm good to go . Right here ! Mmm ? Is there somebody else coming with the rest of it ? The rest ? The rest . No , that is the entire selection . Well , maybe we have had a misunderstanding . Or perhaps your boss is trying to send me a message . Um ... I 'd be happy to let him know that you 're unhappy . Why do n't I take care of your tab for the evening , huh ? It 'd be my pleasure . Here . You know what ? Thank you . It 's very generous . I will let Ivan know about this misunderstanding . Okay
zone3	whores like some fucking congressman ? Tell your puto gringo boss I 'm sending a message . Ivan ! Block ! Did you get in a fight with your kid sister ? Funny guy . Where is he ? Richie , you were just a little too good-looking for this racket . Why did you short him ? I did n't short him . It 's an ongoing negotiation . Then you got more than an ongoing negotiation . You have a fucking problem . Did he take the money ? Yeah , he took it . Then what 's the fucking problem , Richie ? I mean , it 's the gambling business in Costa Rica . Occasionally , you get punched in the face . You let me walk right into it , Ivan . This is your job . You understand ? If you want a safer job , go work for the post office . You want a clear conscience ? Go start a charity . But if you want your own fucking island and your boss says you got ta go out there and take
zone3	come back to work and say , " Do you need me to do it again ? " Because right now , I am giving you the keys to the kingdom . How did you know I 'd even make it out of there alive ? How did you know ? Because you 're a winner . Because I believe in you . And you got hurt . I 'm sorry . But if I 'm telling the truth , I 'd do it again . What the fuck you looking at ? Did you see this coming ? Six months ago , Herrera would n't have touched anyone I know . And six weeks from now , that could be me . Or it could be you . We 're moving up the timetable . Okay ? When the wrong card hits the board , you can go from a great had to one that ca n't win . And if you 're smart enough , you get out while you ca . Hey , what 's going on ? What is the ... What the fuck ? Hello
zone3	. I do n't have any drugs . We 'll see . " We 'll see " ? I do n't have any fucking drugs ! I think the lab is going to test positive for Mexican Brown . That 's not fucking mine . Tar heroin . Come on , man . You planted that ! Pasaporte , United States , huh ? You 're not going to need this anymore . Oh , Richie , Richie , Richie . You 're making me look bad . Shavers , look , I believe you . Everything you said about Block is true , okay ? I 'm trying to go home . You ca n't go home now . Now that the fun 's starting . Especially not without your passport . And I know you ca n't go home now that the sergeant has his hands on you . He 's been a bad boy . Now , Richie , this is what I 'm willing to do for you , man . So I 'll talk to the sergeant and have him wipe the slate clean .
zone3	? You want me to do that for you , huh ? Sergeant , can you do that ? See that ? Look at that smile on his face . See , that 's the problem , Richie . I keep fucking doing for you , so when are you gon na do for me ? When 's it gon na be my turn ? When 's it going to be our turn ? What are you , the only guy here not on Block 's payroll ? - All right ! - Fuck , man ! Why do n't you just fucking arrest him ? You guys do n't have jurisdictional issues like the FBI ! But if I walk him into a station house or a courtroom , what do you think he 's going to do , huh ? He 's going to buy the judge a steak dinner and I do n't have a job ! All you got to do is help us and all this goes away . Otherwise , you better brush up on your prison Spanish because they do n't take too
zone3	Jesus , where the hell you been , man ? What the fuck happened to your face ? Nothing . What did you want to show me ? All right . So they got me running these credit card security protocols . And I get in there , into the code , and I decide to freelance around a little bit , right ? So , I find there 's nothing in the individual players ' accounts . What do you mean , " nothing " ? Nothing . Practically drained , dude . They keep enough in there to cover the floats . So if any given player wanted to cash out , the software would find the money and then pay him off . In the meantime , Block 's just using everybody else 's funds as his own . Wait . So , what are you saying ? This whole fucking thing is a Ponzi scheme . Hey , Richie ! Block 's upstairs . He wants to see you . All right . Hey . Come on in , Richie . Have a seat . So
zone3	make poor decisions when they 're desperate . You know what I mean ? No . What do you mean ? Let 's say you 're being charged by a bear . You 're supposed to stand still . Most people run and they end up getting killed . It 's understandable , right ? Let me show you something . I really have Wilson to thank for this . He do n't look like much , but he 's a dog with a bone when he gets an assignment . This is some surveillance footage he dug up . Would you look at that ? Take a few years off him and the old guy really does look like you , does n't he ? This is the Trop in AC . If I was n't your friend , I 'd say your dad was a deadbeat . There is n't a casino , a bookmaker , or shylock from Vegas to New York that the old man is n't into for some serious wood . You owe money like that , you get a reputation . That 's
zone3	hopefully we can get him some help . And get you some help , too . This is my favorite part , right here . Look at this . That is n't just card counting , that 's passing a bobo . Turns out , the old man 's been kiting counterfeit bills from Tunica to Nevada . They were about to arrest him before I grabbed him up . In fact , I have him over at the Intercontinental Hotel , just down the street . Here 's the thing , Richie . Your dad owes $187,000 to some guys that do n't fuck around . But you 're my man , and you took some hits for me . And I do n't forget that . So this is what I did . I bought the debt . I own the paper on your father . The only person who can do anything to him now is me . Which is good news , because I would never do anything like that . I hold the debt , your dad stays healthy , and we can all go
zone3	, thank you . I appreciate it . Richie ? Uh , come in . Sit . See this ? What do you think ? This is where they put me . It 's a real soft spot , huh ? It 's real nice , Dad . Yeah , it reminds me of that suite we were comped in Atlantic City once when you were a kid . Are you talking about the time you left me all alone in the hotel room while you were at the casino ? Look , Rich , you know , I wish I had a time machine , I 'd go back and I 'd fix everything , but I do n't . We 're here now . And where do you think " here " is ? Huh ? Paradise ? Well , you know , it kind of looks that way to me . Let 's go out on the balcony . Check out the view . Look , I know where I am , all right ? And I knew exactly what was happening the minute my debt got
zone3	. Been around gambling all my life , and that would be a miracle . And miracles do n't happen . So you know Block owns the debt . Yeah . And I know that 's worse than any wise guys walking the boardwalk because it is n't just me that he 's got under his hammer . Yeah , I know . Apparently this shit runs in the family . It does n't have to . I just do n't want to see you making the same mistakes I made . Going after this bullshit . Chasing the action . Come on , do n't let them use me to keep you here . Go . Run . Run , for Christ 's sake . Just run . Go back . Go back to school . I mean ... I 've been a dead man walking for the last 15 years . Dad , try and sit tight . I 'll figure a way to get us both out of this . No , no , no . Come on . After all these years , you 're still
zone3	's your mother talking . She raised you right , I guess . Payoffs are how the casino business in Costa Rica works . It 's why this government does n't shut Block down . But now it 's time for me to buy some goodwill of my own . Yeah ? Agent Shavers was right about everything . We should have left . Shavers ? You said he did n't even approach you . Listen , after the players ' accounts , I found something else . It 's a way bigger scam than I thought . We 're screwed , man . Cronin , slow the fuck down . What are you trying to tell me ? Just come see me . I got ta show you in person . Hey , Richie . Where you going , babe ? Going home . Yeah ? Why do n't you do that later ? Come take a ride with me . Wilson . Where are we going ? Do n't worry about it . Enjoy the ride , man . So neither of you guys are gon na tell
zone3	the boat . Come on . Richie ! How you doing , bud ? Fellas . Hey . Richie , remember , um , that whole thing I was telling you about the Indians ? Not the casino thing , but the respecting what you kill . Or whatever that hokum shit was . All right , here 's the deal with this . The over-under is 90 seconds . Bet is $10,000 . Do I pay you guys enough to jump in on 10 grand ? Yeah , I take the over . How 's that ? What the fuck you talking about ? It 's so fucking dark , it 's gon na be two minutes before they even get the fucking scent . I brought two idiots to Latin America , Richie . It 's like sand to the beach , but what are you gon na do ? What the fuck is this ? This is where the Rio Tarcoles lets out . Ivan ... Your problem is with me , let him go . Hey , Herrera , if you had n't acted like an
zone3	now . So do n't try to be noble . Basically , this place is to crocodiles what Goldman Sachs is to pricks with skinny ties . There 's just a fucking ton of them . Cruise ships come down here , they dump off their edible waste , the crocs have learned to swim downriver and they know to bite whatever jumps in the water . This shit is chicken fat . I do n't know why , but for some reason these fuckers really like poultry . All right , go ahead . All right , ready ? Ready to fire it up ? Wilson , keep the clock . Here we go . One , two ... Fucking Christ , Ivan ! Swim ! What do you want ? ! You scared the shit out of them . Can we fucking pull them back in ? Hold on . Shh , shh . Do you hear them ? I 'm fucking talking to you , motherfucker ! Ivan ! We got fucking money on this , dude . Chill . You 've scared the shit out of
zone3	in ? What the fuck is wrong with you ? Dude ... I 'm doing this for you , man . 80 seconds . Would you just pull them in ? What do you need ? 10 dimes . 90 seconds . Jesus Christ ! Fucking bullshit local legend , I guess . Give me the fucking thing . All right , calm down . Fuck me . It 's just a little fun , that 's all . Come here . Hey , come here ! Oh , shit ! Now they fucking come ! Do something ! I got it . Are you all right ? I 'm not getting them out . You get them out . Pull them in . Holy fuck , man . Come on . Let 's go . What are the odds ? I was kidding around . I did n't really think crocodiles would come . We just got lucky , I guess . Are you all right , Richie ? You seem a little worked up , a little sweaty . Is it the hot night or ... Are you
zone3	good . Terrific . All right , clean them up . Let 's get them out of here . Good luck . Hey , how did that horse do ? Ojo Rojo . I 'm fucking with you . I know this is n't a good time . All right , let 's go . Let 's go . See you soon , Richie . Cronin ? Andrew ? Cronin . Fuck , man . What 's happened ? Did Block send you ? No , he did n't send me . Something 's happened to Cronin . He was cooperating with the Feds . But you knew that already , did n't you ? I did n't . Bullshit . Let me ask you a question . When I talk to you , am I talking to Block ? Not anymore . I wish I could believe that . You can . You can trust ... No , I ca n't trust you . I did trust you ! I did n't know that he was going to use you . Stop fucking lying to me ! Ivan is
zone3	. We 're moving to Antigua . And ? And he 's looking to hang things on someone . A mark . Me . And when he 's gone , all of those people that we 've crossed , they 're gon na come looking for you . How long have you known this ? I started wondering after two years . By the third year , when we left the Caymans , I knew for sure that he was stealing . But by that point I was too far in . I 'd signed a contract , there was a paper trail . That 's what Ivan does to you . He figures out exactly what you want and he gives it to you . I 'm sorry . I hope so . Because what I have to do to get out of this , I ca n't do it alone . The payoff merry-go-round has to keep spinning . And I need operating cash to buy my way out . So it 's less for them and more for me . I 'm just hoping I 'll be
zone3	ta love this country . Yesterday you wanted to kill me and today we 're like brothers . We are not fucking brothers . I need to talk to Herrera . He 's gone , he left the country early this morning . Then we need to talk . Esteban ? Esteban ! Where is he ? I put together a savings account for this guEl Capitan . Yeah , that 's his real name . Is this gon na work ? I guess we 'll see . Where the fuck is Cronin ? You tell me . I thought he was working for you guys . You do n't understand cooperation , do you ? You 're supposed to keep me posted on Block . Circumstances have changed . What 's changed ? Block has my father . Well , if you had told us , we could have kept him safe . But you did n't . So where the hell is Cronin ? I 'm on the phone with him and the next thing I know he fucking disappears ! Shit . You know what ? You
zone3	! You beat the shit out of me ! You say you can protect me , protect my father . You ca n't even protect the only source you had ! Fuck both of you . I 'm done . You 're going to fucking help us ! You understand me ? I 'm not doing shit ! You want to arrest me ? Fucking arrest me ! I 'll fucking kill you ! I do n't give a shit ! All right , let him up ! We went about this all wrong . I 'm sorry , are you okay ? I 'm sorry . But I do n't have time to fucking play with you . Take a picture with me . Happy smile , gringo . Here we go . Good . Now you have forty-eight hours to get me what I need on Block . A piece of evidence that will hold up in court . If you do n't , he gets that picture and your life goes to shit . Let 's go . Come on , Cronin , what the fuck did
zone3	in it . Layers and layers of financial crimes . Block using player accounts as his own piggy bank . Laundering money and , of course , Block 's contingency plan . Me . Oh , my God . There 's enough evidence on here to put Block or me away for a long time . Have you been booking travel ? I have . I put everything I have into it . Planes are n't cheap . Thank you . Block has been siphoning the player account money and directly routing it to bank accounts with my name on them . But when this goes public it 's going to look like I own them . All the bank account info , the missing money , everything . Ivan 's told me to pack . We leave in 48 hours . Everything 's ready in Antigua . You know I 'm with you . New love . What are you doing ? Uh , you know , I was just leaving . I was gon na go make the rounds . One last payoff toEl Capitan . This is

You know , for being such a smart kid , you make some dumb fucking moves , you know that ? You do n't think I know who that guy is ? Where he works , what he does ? Hmm ? You do n't think I know what you 're trying to do ? You 're done , Richie . I think you should just walk outside and get in my car . There 's got ta be some kind of deal you and I can make . Thank you , Richie , but I 'm well taken care of . I think you should stop embarrassing yourself , walk outside , and get in the mother_fucking car , man . You do n't think I 'm taken care of , too ? Richie Furst . Shavers . We found
zone3	. Thank God . Where are you ? Are you bringing me evidence ? No . I 'm bringing you something better . Block timed it perfectly . He 's out the door by the time the bribes stopped and the police took everything down . Yeah ? Hey , Richie . Where are you ? At the office . Ivan , what the hell is going on ? The site 's been frozen . Listen , Richie , you 're about to get arrested , okay ? I 'd love to tell you that I was gon na come down to the police station and bail you out but we both know that 's not true . Sorry it worked out this way . I like you , you 're a good kid . But it is what it is . Sorry , pal . By . You all right ? Yeah , set . You 'll find another boyfriend when we land at the next stop . Younger and dumber next time . Dumber wo n't be easy . Where the fuck is Wilson ? I have n't
zone3	to fend for himself . Do you mind ? Sun . I love new beginnings . Any new industry , the first 10 years , it 's like Russia after Communism . It 's all strength and will . And now , it 's time for a little nuance and finesse . Every player has a leak in his game . Even Block . All you have to do is find it . You really saw me coming , did n't you ? The cars , the boats , the money , everything . You handpicked me , and you slow-played it perfectly . What did you expect me to do , Richie ? Walk into my party , accuse me of cheating in front of all my friends . I ca n't let that go by . That 's the problem with your generation . You guys sat around with your vintage T-shirts and your participation medals and you never did anything . And you got too big and too greedy . Okay . What are you gon na do about it ? You do n't think I own
zone3	think this is ? Bienvenidos a Puerto RicoIvan ! Territory of the United States of America . The Captain , a man of his word . I knew deep down you were just homesick . You know what your biggest problem is , Ivan ? You talk and you talk , but you do n't actually hear yourself . Well , I did . And you 're just like every other gambler who comes onto your site . You press it , when you should have folded and moved on . Later on , when you 're in prison , that voice you 'll be hearing in your head is n't your conscience , it 's fear . Ivan Block , you 're under arrest , my friend . How 's it going , fellas ? Better than you . Money laundering , racketeering , wire fraud . Look under your feet . That 's American concrete . Kiss it , because you 'll be sleeping on it for a long time . We 'll see . That 's the great thing about America , we go soft on financial
zone3	like that . Maybe I 'll see you around , Richie . Good luck , sir . Get this piece of shit in the car . What about him ? Him ? He 's a cooperator . Yeah , do n't worry about him . Think about him banging your girl while you 're in jail . Now , here 's the good part . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . You have the right to an attorney . If you can not afford an attorney , a really fucked-up one will be provided for you . Listen , I want you to get Richie Furst . I want to start this debriefing ASAP . You do n't think he 's on that plane ? You got to be kidding me . Go with the ground crew ! Hey ! Somebody stop that plane ! We had a deal ! Shit !

All right , I 'm sure you can flip a leather on its feet . But what we 're talking about is much more complex than that . - When did you take my wallet ? - You take Zumba ? It 's actually a really good cardio workout . Thank you very much . You 're thinking with your hands . You got ta get inside the vic 's head . Perceive from their perspective . Human behavior is very predictable . If I look at my hand , it naturally pulls your gaze and allows me to enter your space . But when I look up at you , it causes you to look directly at me . Cute . I touch you here , I steal from here . I tap you here , I steal from here . I step to here ... -

The Lime-house Kid is your grandfather . Bucky Spurgeon is your father . " Father " is a very generous term . And you 're Nicky Spurgeon . They call you " Mellow . " - I 'm all crewed up , sweetie . - Oh , come on . Please ! Can we ... ? Can we just ... ?

Two fingers means it 's a prat poke . Three fingers means the leathers an insider . If it 's a cordeen or an ox tongue , I 'll scratch my nose . Unless I use my thumb , which means I am actually scratching my nose . Left or right tail I 'll cock my head , but keister kicks are 95 percent of it . So you just do the touch , and I ding the poke in the nearest mailbox , okay ? I 'm sorry , what ? Okay , plan B . You two , come with me . Excuse me , please , we 're so lost . It was excellent . You wan na wire ? Let me wire . Ponytail 's your mark . Right bridge . Right rear pocket . My bad . -

Who they gon na tell ? - I will kill you ! - It 's my husband ! Every minute there 's something going on
zone3	everywhere . Guys working alone , working in teams . Not just cash either . Identity theft and credit card spoofing are big too . You can skim the data right off a credit card in about a second , . But boosting a wallet only gives you an hour before the Vic gets wise and the cards are canceled . Sn you put the card back . By the time the mark gets wise , he 's in Youngstown arguing with his wife ... mover the charges we rack up before the bill comes . A skimmer swipes the card and records the keystrokes so you can get the pin too . Look , you see that ? Oh , wow , did he make that ? Yeah . A few years back he replaced the credit card terminals at about a dozen 99 Cent Stores in L.A . Took down a few million before they caught on . What does a guy like that do with that kind of money ?

The shopaholics here buy merchandise which we overnight back to ourselves and resell on the gray market . Yesterday we bought 200 MacBook Airs . Oh , my God . Thai is incredible . - Oh , do you think that maybe I ... ?

zone3	my God . How did you do that ? Liyuan Tse . Legendary gambler . He bets on everything . Anything . Huge cash bets , all the time . Once the Bellagio put Bill Gates out of the high-roller 's suite because Liyuan was flying in . He is the perfect Vic . But how did you know who he was gon na pick ? We told him to . We been telling him all day . From the moment he left his hotel room , we 've been priming him . Programming his subconscious . He 's been seeing the number 55 all day bong . On the elevator . In the lobby . Even the stick pin on the doorman . Not only that , we loaded his route from the hotel to the stadium . He looks out the window , primers are everywhere . Now , he does n't see it , but he does . There 's no getting around it . He even sees Farhad . I 'm trying to drive , you Rhino bitch ! Fuck the Rhinos ! Fuck the Rhi
zone3	in a vase to the tramp stamp on the hooker we sent to his room last night . That is genius . Yeah . And it 's not only what he sees . It 's what he hears . The Mandarin word for " five " is woo . There are 124 " woo-woos " in " Sympathy for the Devil . " Now , he 's not registering it , but it 's all there . So when he picks up those binoculars , looks out on the field sees a familiar face with the number 55 on his jersey some little voice in the back of his mind says : " That 's it . " And he thinks it 's intuition . And he picks . Do you want me to write it down ? And you , being in the dark , was the convincer . We call that the " Little Blind Mouse . " I 'm the " Blind Mouse " ? You 're such an asshole . You ca n't tell me that 's 100-percent real . Well , it 's probabilistic .
zone3	better than Vegas . And what if he picked wrong ? Double it till it happens . That 's amazing . You 're amazing . Nicky ! What 's wrong ? You did great . Okay . What 's going on ?

Wait , can you just talk to me ' ? - I 'm sorry . You did great . You did great . - Nicky ? What 's going on ? Answer me ! Nicky ! Shit . I was n't expecting such a kind face . The tech says his gizmo checks out . But in all candor , I do n't like this . And I do n't like him . Why ? He 's a con man , sir . That 's the point . I keep my Beretta well-fed . Owens . Why do you
zone3	. You are a man known for great skills of persuasion and deception . You were very hard for me to find . - Why did you take my offer ? - Went broke . My car . Forty million euro in RD , easily . McEwen , Rahal , Lotus ... Any team in any class , they spend half of that . But I have something none of them have . - A fuel-burn algorithm . - Yes . The EXR . They all want it . It 's legal . And my engineers promise it guarantees me a win . That 's not enough for me . This year McEwen is the only team standing in my way . That is why I wanted you . - So ... - This needs to be discreet . It needs to be safe . No holes . I will pose as a disgruntled team engineer of yours offering to sell the EXR to McEwen . What I will give him is a fake . It does n't really do anything , just gives false readings to their instruments .
zone3	a slight added edge . A third of a second every few laps . Imperceptible . Just because the techs say that it checks out what makes you think you can convince them that you 're absolutely real ? That you 're ... That you 're totally authentic ? You ca n't be clicking around here , boy . You do n't need to worry about me . I 'm extremely well researched . We 'll proceed as planned , starting at the kickoff party tonight . - Okay . - I 'll be seen drinking and boisterous and disgruntled . I will approach you in full view of McEwen . An argument will ensue , I will throw my drink I will shove you , if that 's okay with you ? It 's okay . I 'd be very surprised if McEwen did n't approach me right there but if not , I will contact him . - Good . Whatever he 's willing to pay me , I will be keeping 100 percent for myself on top of the 1 million from you . - Do we
zone3	we have a deal . That 's great . Appreciate your time . I 'll see you tonight . - Thank you . Do n't say I did n't warn you . Drama . I 'm excited . That 's right . Do you speak English ? Yes , absolutely . Yeah , but you speak good Spanish . Oh , yes . Oh , why , thank you , thank you . Um ... Look , I 'm here tonight for business . And I am a recovering alcoholic . So when I ask you for a vodka martini on the rocks if you could give me water with olives that would be fantastic . - Great decision , sir . Wise . - Thank you . And the thing is , I do n't even drink . That man got me drinking again . - Vodka martini on the rocks . - On the rocks . I wonder if " Garriga " is Spanish for " thief . " Oh , my God , what a drinker ! Who the fuck put a couch full of women in

No . We 're together . Have been for a longtime . I 'm out of the game . Jess , um ... All right . Uh , about New Orleans , and just ... Oh , Nicky
zone3	. I mean , if anything , I should be thanking you . You did me a favor . Well , that 's fantastic . He 's probably wondering where I am . Take care of yourself , okay ? You too . Be well . Um , Nicky . He does n't know about my past , ... you do n't know me . Okay ? Okay . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Alcohol . Can I get a vodka , please ? Sure . This is water . No , sir , it 's vodka . It 's water . Sir , I know who you are . Marcello told me about you and your condition , so back off . All right , you 're kidding . Are you drunk ? Mr . Garriga is not a guy you wan na cross . Me neither . Now just what part of the plan calls for a tray full of appletinis ? Pledging a sorority ? Mm . I 'm just rethinking the plan a little bit . Goddamn prima-Donna delicate-science bullshit . You
zone3	n't CERN . Just do what you 're being paid to do . Shitheel . Hey ! Garriga ! Oh , God . Do n't worry , it 's just a disgruntled engineer . I expect you have something to say to me . - Ow ! - Oh , my God . Oh , shit . - Why are you punching ? - You stole from me ! Nobody steals from me ! I am such a disgruntled engineer ! - Get him out of here ! - Yes , sir . Out ! Get out ! Oversold it a bit , did n't you ? I was just caught up in the moment . Ah ! Get him out . Get rid of him . It 's okay . I 'm good . Go back to the party . - Are you okay ? - Yeah , I 'm okay . What the hell was that ? The racing business , carino . - Jesus . - That 's all . Wait a minute . You ca n't throw me out . I 'm staying in this hotel
zone3	Mr . McEwen would like to have lunch . Information is on the card . I still got it . McEWEN : You ever heard of Udo Pappenphus ? - What the fuck are you looking at ? - Nothing . I 'm sorry , I 'm ... Udo Pappenphus was an engineer for Ferrari for many years . Fucking brilliant . One day , Udo Pappenphus was found behind a berm with his throat cut . Udo he was that prick Garriga 's man . I want 3 million euro . Well , fuck . Jesus . It 's the EXR . EXR . You 're Father-fucking-Christmas to me , mate . I 'm gon na need to see some proof .

They 're on the thing . Oh , yeah . She is a beauty . - I love these race skanks . - She 's
zone3	race skank . Town 's lousy with them . - Can we get back to business ? Please . - She 's a little small on lop for my taste . One man 's small is another man 's perfection . It 's like a " breasts are a subjective opinion " topic . Maybe if you 're booking a fashion show . I 'm talking about fucking slapping balls , mate . Do you want the thing or not ? I 'm gon na need to see proof . I 'll contact you . - A Spritz , por favor . - Okay . And a vodka and cranberry , please . Hey , you need to put some clothes on . Excuse me ?

You do n't knew me , remember ? Oh . And what was that last night ? Was that about me ? Please .
zone3	No , Jess . I 'm working for him . But I would n't trust him if I were you . But I should trust you ? - All right , Jess . Okay . - That 's interesting . Come on . Nicky , if Rafael sees us together , I do n't know what 's gon na happen , okay ? He 's the jealous type . You need to stay away from me . Fuck Rafael . And , Nicky ? You 're still an easy lift . Stop touching my shit , Jess . - Well ? - Looks credible . Three million , eh ? Yes , sir . I can have the complete package in 48 hours . Codes , documentation and analysis . No worries , mate . No worries . So , what 's next ? Wait for my call . Thank you . Senor Garriga 's assistant called . She pulled a few things she said you might like . Great . Sorry ... Miss ? You ... You forgot your bag . You really should be more aware . Oh
zone3	, it is . Where 'd you learn that ? It 's all they drink here . And it says it on the label . You know , Nicky , I 've been thinking about all this . And ? And , um ... Nicky . Let me have it . Nicky , if we just ran . If we just-You know , if I could slip away or if we could ... Yes . - Can we just ... ? - Whatever . Yes . I ca n't . I ca n't , I 'm sorry . Wait , wait , wait . Wait , Jess . Whatever you want . I can keep you safe . - Nicky . - Come on , Jess . Nicky , you taught me so much . But I 've learned a lot since then . And I 'd really like to show you all the things I 've learned . Like how I learned how to play men . Like I just played you . - How 's it feel ? - Wow . - Yeah . Wow . - Ah
zone3	pathetic . " I 'll keep you safe " ? What was that ? Does that work ? Does that get you laid ? - Hey , that was not a line . - I 'm not falling for your shit again . - Do n't ... Ah . - Okay ? And I 'm very happy . So stay away from me . Nice ass-o . Nice ass . Nice ass . Very nice , very nice . Hey . Let 's get a steak . - A steak ? It 's 9 in the morning . - Take that up with God . How was the flight ? Jesus Christ . They had me squeezed between two fat guys . It sounds like you 're complaining and you should n't be , because I 'm giving you a cut . All right , where 's this going down ? - You got the piece ? - It 's in my bag . Can you get it ? I 'm too fat to reach it . Watch this . Nothing but net . - Ah , fuck , you
zone3	Hey there . Farhad ? Hi ! How are you ? God , look at you . You 've lost so much weight . I did a cleanse . - You here with Nicky ? - Sort of . - Do you mind ? - Please . You must be turned on by all these women . - I suppose . - You do more than suppose . What does that mean ? - Oh , dear God . - I 'm just saying . Please , never make that face again . I do n't even wan na know what that means . - Oh , I think we do . Heh-heh . - I think we do n't . Everybody knows you 're a lesbian . It 's completely fine . - Who knows I 'm a lesbian ? - It 's especially fine to me . - Where are you getting this from ? - Every other time you speak , I smell a vagina . - It 's not true . - That 's not a bad thing , believe me . Oh , Jesus .
zone3	all nuts . - I do ? Good . - Yeah . I 've never seen him like this . You know , he 's barely worked since New Orleans . Seriously ? I know he 's an asshole . I mean , a really big asshole . - Yeah . - He should 've handled it better . But he 's my friend , and I 'm gon na bat for him . So can you give him a break ? I do n't care what Nicky told you . I 'm not falling for this shit . I do n't think you got that right . He seems different now , and I 've known him a longtime . How do I know that ? What is that ? It 's an orange . He kept it for you all this time . Mini-market ! Shit . - That looks nice . Hm . - I ca n't believe you kept it . Or found it . Or replicated it . - Ha-ha-ha . - I do n't know with you . - No , I kept it
zone3	n't work for a longtime . Yeah , a couple years . Just did n't feel right . I even reached out to my dad . I had n't seen him in years . I asked him if he 'd ever gone straight before . " Of course . I go straight every time I 'm on parole . - Oh . - Now drink a cup of concrete . Man up . " - Solid advice . - Yes . - Mm . - Heh-heh . How 's that working out ? Well , thought I was ready to work . Then the girl walked in . Why are you going to all this trouble , Nicky ? What do you want from me ? I can convince anyone of anything . I once convinced a man that an empty warehouse was the Federal Reserve . - So I 'm good . - Yeah . You 're the best . But what I really want is to tell you that I 've changed . And tell you that I am sorry . And I just want you to believe
zone3	I want to believe you . I 'm different now . I have to be getting back . I ca n't do this . I 'm sorry . You all right ? - What happened ? - I do n't wan na talk about it . - Did he do something to you ? - No . Jess , did he put his hands on you ? - Tell me what happened . - Just ... Just kiss me . I have to leave soon . I want you to come with me . I know you think you love him . But I want you to come with me tonight . I do n't love him . I just ... But I ... But you ca n't trust me . I understand that . If you come with me , we 'll figure it out . I want ... It 's Owens . I got ta take it . Yeah . - Where are you ? - I 'm in my room . Good . I 'm at the door . He 's at the do ... Uh ...
zone3	Damn , you should 've ... All right , uh , give me a sec . We 're good , just ... Ugh . I 'll get rid of him . Hey . You 're still sleeping ? I thought you were meeting with McEwen . I am . Later . There 's a lazy Sunday softness to your generation . Makes me uncomfortable . I like to be on my feet . I 'll lie down when I get cancer . Or if I fuck . Both of which will be done on my back , in case you were wondering . Um , no , actually , I was n't wondering . But thank you for sharing that . Sarcasm . Another pillar of your generation . You wan na tell somebody to fuck off , tell them to fuck off . Do n't say , " Gee , what a great jacket . " It 's weakness . That is a messy bed . Yeah , I do n't sleep well . - Someone here , son ? - Who you calling " son " ? -
zone3	No , tell me . You with your iPhones and your smartphones and your laptops and computers . All of which produce nothing but a barrage of useless information . Fucking Twitter . As if anyone actually cares that you 're eating a turkey sandwich for lunch . Sorry . Panini . - Sarcasm ? - Satire . Fucking panini . Look , um , are we done ' ? You might be . Who 'd you pick up at the airport ? - Garriga has you fucking following me ? - I got people there . - My computer guy . - Why ? Is there a problem ? There wo n't be because he 's fucking here . I got a little red hair on my taint that tickles when somethings afoot . And lately I 've been scratching my nethers like a fucking macaque . Okay . Look , there 's no reason for anybody to panic and start getting bent out of shape because we 're getting to the end . Nice day . Nicky . How the fuck did you do ... ? Back here
zone3	was wrong . Enough of the pleasantries . Hey , nice jacket . Fuck off . It 's real . Gordon ! Gordon ! Fucking you , mate . You 're my new fucking favorite person , fella . I swear you 're fucking 6 inches fucking taller and twice as fucking handsome since you walked in here . There you go , son . - Lap it up . - My pleasure , Mr . McEwen . - I wish you the best of luck . - Friends like you , who needs luck ? Now fuck off . Ha-ha . - Yes ? - Mr . Garriga . - How did it go ? - It 's done . - Good . - I wish you the best of luck . With friends like you , who needs luck ? Jess , letting you know , uh , I left a key for you at the desk . See you at 7 . Wish you the best of luck . With friends like you , who needs luck ? - I wish you the best of luck .
zone3	I wish you the best of luck . With friends like you , who needs luck ? - Wish you the best of luck . - With friends like you , who needs luck ? - Best of luck . - Friends like you , who needs luck ? Friends like you , who needs luck . Friends like you , who needs luck , huh ? Jess . Fuck . Sorry I 'm late . What ? Nothing . Let 's go . Do you really think I 'm such an amateur that I would not have someone with McEwen ? Someone to keep eyes on you ? Hm ? Twenty years in this business teach you never to be too careful . He is my secret weapon . Now , heh , imagine my surprise when Gordon showed me what you sold to McEwen . Not some fake softwares , as we discussed but my plans , my designs . The real EXR ! Stolen from my sewers , stolen from me ! What 's more , you sold it to McEwen for 3 million euros . But
zone3	Which means you sold it to everyone ! This is my reputation . This is my standing . You 've made me look like an amateur . Ah , that 's what you get when you hire a con man . Thieving piece of shit . How did you get the information ? Hm ? And what did she have to do with it ? All right . Nothing . All right ? Listen ... - Tell me . Hm ? - Hey ... Hm ? Tell me ! Leave her the fuck alone ! I 'll tell you ! I have a guy . He cracked your encryption . He found a back door into your server . It was actually pretty easy . You should probably fire your IT guy . No ! You used my login . My password . - Computer tries every possible combination . - Bullshit ! This generates a new password every 15 minutes . It never leaves my sight . - How did you get it ? - Who the fuck cares , man ? It 's done . Okay . Tell
zone3	Let her go ! - How , how , how ? - Let her go ! - How ? - All right . It was her ! It was her . All right ? It was her ! It was her . It was her . But she did n't know . She did n't know anything . Okay . Your security was tight . It was tighter than I expected . I thought I could break the key , but I could n't . Then I saw Jess at the party . And when I found out that the two of you were together I knew she was my in . So I used her . And I 've been using her . You see , there 's a science to getting people to trust you . With women , it 's all about emotion . Connection . That you feel the emotion as strongly as they do . They 've been dreaming about that shit ever since they were little girls . With her , it was shared history . A friendly face . Set her off balance
zone3	weight ! Start discussing emotional shit . They 're disarmed . Now they 're open . You know you got them when they start to unconsciously mimic you . A head nod . A hand gesture , it means you 're in sync . Sociologists refer to it as the Gauchais Reaction . And then you move in for the kill . You tell them how they 've changed you . I 'm different , Jess . Changed how you see the world . Then you close . A talisman . A gift that says : You 've always been in my thoughts . The necklace had a wireless keylogger in it . All I needed was for her to enter your room . And when she did that , I had what I needed . Picked up on your keystrokes . I logged in to your computer as you and downloaded everything about the EXR . I 'm sorry . But it was not her fault . She had no idea . She got fooled . So why do n't we let her go ? And me and you
zone3	I think he 's lost his mind . What 's funny ? More bullshit . What is so funny ? More lies . What the fuck is so funny ? What 's so funny ? Garriga 's not my boyfriend . - What ? - I hardly even know him . She 's just a race skank . What 's a race skank ? - But I saw you ... - No . You saw what I wanted you to see . You taught me that , remember ? She 's been driving me crazy . Hanging around , flirting , teasing . The minute I try to get her up to my room : - But I have a headache . - Cramps . That time of the month . It 's like a crime scene . I have Scrabble in my room . A headache . A period . Right ? The world 's longest period . She 's never even been in my room . - What ? - We 're so screwed . What the fuck ? I was trying to ... What the fuck ,
zone3	- This watch ? - You 're not still doing watches . It 's a Piaget Emperador . It 's worth 200 grand . I 'd been on him for a week . I was waiting for my chance . And then you showed up . - You are so much better than watches , Jess . - It 's what I am good at and I like it . Okay , no , no , no . When you came to my hotel , he had roughed you up . No . He had roughed me up . She was stealing from him . He caught me charging Garriga 's credit line ... - ... and scared the shit out of me . - This is really fucking unbelievable . You did all of this to make me jealous ? No . Some of it was payback for New Orleans , but ... Yeah , to make you jealous . I can not believe you lied to me . - You ca n't believe I lied ? - Ca n't believe it . - You ca n't believe I
zone3	Oh , that 's so rich from you . So rich . - That 's what you wan na say to me ? - Yeah , because there 's always a job . - Be sure . I just tried to save your life . By lying ! Because you 're always lying , Nicky ! I do n't know when you 're telling the truth . And now we 're dead . Fuck . She 's right . You 're right . Heh . Here 's the thing about lying . Here 's the problem : Fucks up all your options . Paints you into a corner . What the fuck you talking about ? You out of your mind ? And then you 're forced to do some really dumb shit . - You wan na die ? - Well , if I die , I wan na die telling the truth . And if I lie , I wan na lie like normal people lie . I want my wife to say , " Hey , honey . Do I look fat in these jeans ? "
zone3	. You look terrific . You should wear those . " That 's how I wan na lie . But this ... If I 'm done I 'm gon na tell the truth . So , Mr . Garriga , I 'm gon na tell you the truth . And you are not gon na like it at all . About a year ago , I pick up the phone ... - What the fuck are you doing ? - Nicky ? I could n't take another fucking word . You 're next , honey . - No ! Are you crazy ? - Look at me . Look at me . Look at me . What the hell were you thinking ? Huh ? Fuck you . Now s0mebody 's hurt . You know what ? I have nothing to do with this . Look at me . Look at me . It 's okay . This is your mess . You clean it up . And keep me out of it . I do n't know what to do . Please ... Please , please , stay with
zone3	No , no , no . No . Look at me . Look at me . Look at me . It 's fine . Nicky , look at me . Look at my eyes . I love you , okay ? I love you . Please . Please , do n't do this . Please . Please . I trust you . You can not leave me again . Please , do not leave me again . Please . What the fuck ? You want him to fucking die ? What kind of a piker are you , for chrissakes ? Oh , shit ! Did n't he tell you I was on the inside ? Jesus . You must be terrified . It 's gon na be okay . He is not gon na die . Do you hear me ? He is not gon na die . Probably . You see , you shoot between the third and the fourth rib just about eleven o'clock off the left nipple . Here . - Hold pressure on that . Hold pressure on that . - Okay . That misses
zone3	however , puncture the lung . Let me in . There we go . Is this Toledo Panic Button ? Oh , maybe you 're not such a piker after all . Left untreated , you got about 10 minutes before you drown in your own blood . But you patch it up ... - ... you account for the cavity pressure . - Oh . - Agh . - Oh , God . And then ... There we are . There we go . There we go . - There 's my boy . - Ah ! - Oh , Jesus . - There 's my boy . - Ah . Agh ! - Are you okay ? - Oh , Jesus . - Here . Hold on to that . Hold on to that . Keep your eye on that . If he ca n't breathe , you pull the plunger again . - Okay ? - Okay . Good Lord , I can not believe that you made me shoot you . And then for what ? So that you can make cow eyes at some race
zone3	- I 'm not a race skank ! You die with the lie , Mellow and you still just might . - Fuck you . Do n't call me " Mellow . " Jesus Christ . You 're his dad ? In the loosest fucking possible terms . I 'm Bucky , by the way . You know , I like you , honey . You can take a punch . Ha-ha . - God . - And there it is . Tell you what , you steal us a car , and I 'll gather up the money . I ca n't steal a car . I 've been working for this prick Spaniard for three years and he 's got a guy at McEwen and does n't tell me ? What the hell ever happened to trust ? Are we almost there ? I bust my ass to get you that EXR crap and ... Agh . And then the girl walked in . Do n't be an asshole . That any way to talk to your father ? You 're not my father . You walked away
zone3	my trade , I taught you my passion . Three generations of skills . Ah . And in spite of all my earnest efforts , in spite of all my hard work you turned into a good person . Well , I just ... Ah . Go figure . And I left you on the street for a good goddamn reason . - Because I was soft . - Oh , that just shows what you Know you dumb son of a bitch . We had a good thing going . And then one day like seven years in , we 're running this poker deal in Boston and a guy pulled a gun . Fucking gun . Glock . First time I 'd ever seen one . And I 'm just paralyzed . Heh . And all I could think about was the kid . That night I walked . I never looked back . Love 'll get you killed in this racket . No place for that shit here . No happiness with that . You know how they say there 's honor among thieves . Well ,
zone3	choice . - So I 'm taking the money . - Mmm . All of it . - Mm-mm . Uh-huh . Well , that explains a lot . Yeah , that 's Dad . - No . - Yep . See you at Christmas . One , two , ready ? Okay , that 's good , that 's good . - Mm . - Okay , almost there . I do n't know what we 're gon na do now . We 'll be fine . How ? Trust me . - Oh . I got you . - Agh . I got you .
zone3	7017640 This story begins in a secret place hidden deep in a forest . That is a Smurf . We call him Clumsy . And this is our village , where there 's a Smurf for just about everything . Like Jokey . Hey , here 's a present for you . Gullible Smurf , you 're so gullible . Actually , I meant to give you this one . Thanks ! - 96 , 97 , 98 , 99 , 100 . - Here 's Hefty . And over here is ... Now , for the one-fingered pushup . One , two , three ... Meet Nerdy Smurf . - Excuse me ? - Sorry , Brainy . Just kidding . Nosey . Well , what 's going on over there ? Paranoid Smurf . Winner . Loser . Karate Smurf . Handy . Vanity . Farmer . Painter . Baker . Magician . Scuba . Policeman . Therapist . Sometimes I just feel blue . There 's even Table-Eating Smurf . Hi . Yeah , we 're not too sure about him , either . And then there 's me , Papa Smurf . I sort of run
zone3	me . Or Clumsy . Or any of them . It 's about the only girl in our village . Smurfette . Hi , Laundry Smurf . - Howdy-do , Smurfette . - Hey , guys . But that 's not the only thing that 's different about Smurfette . She was created by the evil wizard , Gargamel . Using dark magic , he made her from a lump of clay . Now , go and find Smurf Village . Luckily , I knew a little magic of my own . But there was still one problem . Smurfette 's name does n't tell us anything about her . Okay , the physics are ... It does n't tell us who she is . - High heels . - Or what she does . So , what exactly is a Smurfette ? Well , let me be frank . She 's a rubbish baker . Let 's see . Smurfette . Smurfette , Smurfette , Smurfette . It 's not here . Well , Smurfette is a combination of a Smurf and an Ette . But what 's an
zone3	... She 's the greatest . The most wondrous creature on Earth . Yes , you are . Smurfette ... I got it . This is one of those eternal questions that we 'll never , ever know the answer to . Wait , she is ? Do you think she heard me ? So , what is a Smurfette ? No one wanted that answer more than Smurfette herself . What are you doing ? Hey , Grouchy , I was just ... Leaving ? This is my bench . I come here same time every day , and I ... Let me guess . " And grouch . " Exactly . I can do that . I can grouch . Hi , Grouchy . Hi , Smurfette . Nice day , huh ? No , it 's not . It 's gon na rain ! Which actually helps the plants grow . But also means it 's gon na be cloudy , so , chew on that . Then again , there might be a rainbow . But rainbows are dumb . Just kidding . I love rainbows
zone3	ya ? No , I 'm not . In fact , you 're actually kind of bad at it . Yup . But you 're also bad at it . That 's a lie . You 're really , really good at it . Hi , Brainy . Smurfette . Thank goodness you 're here . I was ... We 're running trials on my new invention . The Smurfy Thing Finder . Test subject , Hefty Smurf . Hey , Smurfette ! I mean ... - Hey , Smurfette . - Hey . That thing 's safe , right ? Is it safe ? Of course . I 'd get back here if I were you . Snappy Bug . Take this down . Smurfy Thing Finder trial 1.03 . - Ready , Hefty ? - Roger that . It works ! This thing really gets me . It 's able to hone in on Hefty 's dominant trait . Super strength . Which I distill into this . I call it Brainy 's Super Smurfy Power Fuel . Here , you can try it first . All clear
zone3	like " all clear , " it makes me not want to ... Hey , guys . Hi , Clumsy . You 're just in time to witness scientific history . What 's going on in here ? None of your business , Nosey . Well , all right . Hey ! If that vegetable hat can tell us that Hefty is strong , maybe it can tell me what an Ette is . Power it up , Brainy . Fascinating . What happened ? Somehow , instead of sending energy out , you absorbed it . Probably something to do with the fact that you 're not a real ... A real Smurf ? Go ahead , you can say it . No , no , I just meant that this machine was n't built for a Smurf of your , well , origins . Yeah , it 's okay . I get it . Brainy . Hey , you know what ? Let 's all go have some fun . Yeah ! - Pizza ! - Smurfboarding ! Smurfboarding ! It 's almost ready , Azrael . A
zone3	from between the toes of a yak . And a piece of cheese I left in my underpants last week . That ought to do it . Presto ! Twelve spherical petrification modules . Or , as I like to call ' em , freeze balls . You 're welcome , Azrael . Dinner is served . Ingrate . Besides , these freeze balls are n't for catching mice . They 're for capturing those elusive Smurfs . My holy grail . The gold at the end of my rainbow . The most potent magical ingredient in the world . Next slide . Imagine the power in 100 of them combined . How I 've searched high and low , under every rock , it seems , with no sign of them anywhere . Not now , Azrael . I 'm in the middle of a lecture . My plan is simple . Find Smurf Village , capture all the Smurfs , drain them of their magic and , finally , use that magic to become the most powerful wizard in the world ! Look at me with hair .
zone3	first place ? Blue blazes ! I 've spotted Smurfs in the forest ! Well , it 's my telescope . Monty ! Come , my majestic eagle . Your talons are digging into my shoulders . That 's better . Now , fly . Go capture me some Smurfs . No , no ! No , you 're going the wrong way ! Yeah ! Oh , no . My turn ! Safety third . Oh , boy . Yeah ! Really takes your breath away , does n't she ? This is incredible ! Oh , no ! She 's getting way too close to the Forbidden Forest . She ca n't go over that wall . Come on . No , no , no , wait . Do n't go . Wait . Wait , who are you ? Do n't be afraid . Hey , you ca n't go in there . - Smurfette ! - Smurfette ! - Smurfette , you okay ? - What happened ? What happened ? I saw a Smurf . - What ? - Who was it ? I do
zone3	! Code blue ! Guys , come on . We 've got ta get her . I have a bad feeling about this . Do you ? Does it have to do with the giant vulture carrying our friend off to Gargamel 's lair ? Monty , my regal raptor . You 've done it , you 've caught a Smurf . Give me a kiss . Finally , you bring me what I 've been asking for . A tiny , blue-skinned , shirtless ... You ! Let me out of here , you Smurf-obsessed wannabe wizard . Is that any way to talk to the man who brought you into this world ? I 'd prefer it if you just called me " Papa . " - I would never call you that . - Your loss . What 's this ? What are you hiding ? Hand it over , you pseudo-Smurf . Thank you , Azrael . What do we have here ? A different design ? Yes , of course , I noticed that right away . Slightly before you did , in fact .
zone3	not telling you anything . - Tell me . - No . - Tell me ! - No ! - You better tell me . - No ! - Fine . Do n't tell me . - I wo n't . Stupid reverse psychology never works . Who cares ? You 've already given me what I need . Come along , Azrael . Where on earth did I put those ingredients ? I know this . Go left , then right , back handspring , stick the landing . Is it a person , book or movie ? No one ever understands your hand signals , Hefty . Never mind . Just follow me and stay close . Wort of worm and hair of cat . Show me the home of this Smurf hat . Long have you searched for these creatures of blue . But this hat comes from somewhere new . Yes . Where ? Where does it come from ? A village of Smurfs , where enchantment grows . An entire village . Good . Go on . Go on . The location of which ...
zone3	Just start with that . Start with " I do n't know . " Lousy cheap-o cauldron . But here is a clue . Fascinating . But what is it ? Trees ? Must be a symbol for something , or a code . Trees , trees , breeze , knees . Babies crawl on their knees . Check all the nurseries in the area ! We 're going to need to disguise ourselves as babies . Now , where can I get a giant diaper ? Azrael , it 's not your map . You want your own map , we 'll get you your own map , but this is my ... Wait a minute . Look what I found . Three tall trees , in the Forbidden Forest . We 've never searched there before . I 'm a genius . Azrael , it 's time to take a road trip . Prepare my trail mix . Smurfette , congratulations . You 've just led me to an undiscovered population of Smurfs . They have no idea we even exist . I 'll be like ... They
zone3	" And I 'll be like ... And they 'll be like ... " Run ! No ! Run , run , run ! " You evil little genius . The rotten apple does n't fall too far from the tree after all . Does it ? Get your fur and feathers in gear , boys . We leave at first light . Right after breakfast , say 8:00 , 8:30 . 9:00 at the latest . - Wait , Brainy , the map . - I 'm on it . Fine , maybe 9:30 . Absolutely no later than 10:00 , though . - What the ... It 's a jailbreak ! - Go , go , go ! They know my plans . They 'll ruin everything ! Is this safe ? Well , it 's a giant crossbow , so I 'm gon na go with " no . " Do n't let them escape . - Where are the seat belts ? - Get them ! Get those Smurfs ! Fire in the hole ! Get those Smurfs ! Azrael 's gaining on us . Incoming
zone3	Come on . Smurf this way . Run faster ! Run faster ! Why are our legs so short ? Why are our feet so big ? - Why are my muscles so big ? - Really , man ? Guys ! Guys ! A little help here . It 's coming . - Yes ! - All right ! Well , I know four Smurfs who have some explaining to do . - Oh , boy . - Hi . - Oh , my gosh . Papa , you will not believe it . - We ran into the Forbidden Forest . One at a time . One at a time . Please . Please . - Smurfette sees this mystery Smurf . - We have to go to the Forbidden Forest . I 've told you time and again , the Forbidden Forest is forbidden . And now you 're talking about maps and mystery Smurfs and Gargamel 's lair . None of this makes any sense , and I really do n't understand why you ca n't follow simple rules . You snuck out and it put
zone3	way I can keep you safe is if ... You 're grounded . - Grounded ? No , not grounded ! - What ? No way ! - But , Papa , but ... - Come on ! No " buts . " None of you are to take one step out of your mushrooms without telling me where you 're going . Do you understand that ? - You 're right , Papa . - What ? You 're right . I do n't know what we were thinking . Good . Because , as I was saying , you behaved completely irresponsibly . Yes . Right . Exactly . I could n't agree more . Right , guys ? - Yeah , right . - Yeah . Yeah , yeah . - What are you talking about , Smurfette ? - Okay . Yes , so ... And furthermore ... In fact , I think we should all go to our rooms right now and think about what we 've done . - Well , I think that 's ... - Tough , but fair . - Come
zone3	Okay , I 'm moving . - What 's your endgame here ? Did you get pecked on the noggin , Smurfette ? - Actually , Smurfette ... - Do n't worry , Papa . We are certainly going to do some thinking about what we did . And so forth . But we will definitely not be leaving our rooms until we 've thought this whole thing out . And then , just for good measure , we 'll think about it some more . Yes , but ... Great talk , Papa . I have no idea what I 'm doing . Hefty , I know that 's you . ' Sup , Smurfette ? Brainy . How did you do that ? And , I assume , Clumsy . - All good . - What are you guys doing out here ? We knew you were up to something . This is all my fault , Hefty . But , Smurfette , the Forbidden Forest ? It 's too dangerous . I have to at least warn that lost village . Well , we 're Team Smurf
zone3	coming with you . I ca n't ask you to do that . - You did n't ask . - We volunteered . - Thanks , guys . - First things first . Bug technology . Cool . According to my map , we should be standing right in front of this very large , tall stone wall . Check . One small step for four small Smurfs ... Okay . Let us proceed . - Smurfette ! - You okay , Smurfette ? Nice flowers . Nice flowers . Not nice flowers ! Where 's Clumsy ? Hey ! We just met ! I 'm not that kind of Smurf . Watch out for the steep embankment . Clumsy , you okay ? I 'm seeing stars . Good work , Clumsy . You may have discovered a new subspecies of flying insectoid . Amazing ! A winged , fire-breathing Anisoptera . Let 's see . How should we classify this ? Maybe . I mean , seems like an easy choice , but I 'm just not sure . Yea , okay , let 's go with "
zone3	dragon . " Nope ! Less " fly ! " Less " fly ! " Guys ! I 'm okay . A little help here . Monty , get off of me . I hate nature . How gaudy . Azrael , do something ! It 's quite painful . Stop laughing . This is not funny . Watch it ! Let me go ! These nests are made of some material I 've never seen before . You know , I think I 've had enough of these flying Antipastos for one day . Hey ! What are you doing here ? Well , I was thinking of getting a little place out here . Just a quiet place in the forest . It 's a little breezy up on the hill . What do you think I 'm doing out here ? You are never going to find that village , Gargamel . Smurfette , if it was n't for you , I would n't even know about those other Smurfs . - Get ' em , boys . - Smurfintine formation ! Go ! - Hey !
zone3	- Smurfintine ! - Smurfintine ! - Smurfintine ! Smurfintine ! Hey , you . You 're the clumsy one , right ? Think fast . I caught it ! This is n't good . - Clumsy , give ' em back their egg ! - Okay . Oh , come on ! - Clumsy ! - I 'm trying ! I 'm really , really sorry , guys ! Over there ! I did n't mean to poach your egg . Well , they 're toast . It does n't matter . What 's a few worthless pennies when there 's a pot of gold at the end of my rainbow ? Trust me , they 're goners . I 'm telling you , they 've been fried to a blue crisp . They 're Smurf kabobs . Smurfberry flambe . Marshmallows . Can it , fuzzball . They 're dead . Dead , I say ! Hello ? Smurfette ? Echo ! Darkness . I do n't do well in the darkness . I have enough trouble in the daylight . Hold on , everyone . We need
zone3	good thinking , " Brainy . " - Guys ? - Darkness ! Do n't be scared . Just ... Just think happy thoughts . It 's not really happy times right now ! - Just stay in the light , Clumsy . - Too late . I 'm walking into the darkness ! What are you ... Why ? I 'm really freaking out , you guys ! Stop , everyone . Okay , go into your backpacks , get out your emergency tunnel survival kit , find the small glass vial marked " light , " and shake it really hard . Clumsy ? How you doing ? Okay , I guess . Just hang tight , Clumsy . I 'm not sure how long this will take or how long we 'll be down here , so , everybody , whatever you do , do n't eat all your rations . I just ate all my rations ! - Clumsy ! - I 'm stress-eating ! I 'm coming , Clumsy . Follow the sound of my voice . Wait ! These tunnels are like a maze
zone3	We got ta do something . I 'm with her . Time for some action . We 're doing this all wrong . Smurfette ! I 'm close , Clumsy . Almost there . That 's just the echo playing tricks on us . - Anybody ? - I 'm here . I 'm here right around this corner . Hey , everybody ? My light is going out . That is it ! I 'm punching us out of here . It 's collapsing . Hefty ! Put those fists away before you get us killed ! At least I 'm trying something . - I 'm gon na blow us out of here ! - No ! - Oh , yeah ! - Do n't ! Too late ! Clumsy ? - Hey , Smurfette . - Clumsy ! Hang on . I 'm coming , Clumsy bro . I got you , little buddy . Yeah ! Stampede ! I think my rations are coming up . What ? What 's so funny ? Now , that 's what I call " talking out of your butt
zone3	in knowing that we 're in sight of three tall trees ? - All right . - Yeah , we are . And Bucky is gon na get us there extra fast . - Bucky ? - Seems like a Bucky to me . Hit it , Bucky ! Smurfette ? Before you say anything , just listen . Now , I know yesterday I might have been a bit tough on you and the boys , and I know there are times I 'm a little overprotective . Okay , a lot overprotective . But you have to understand , you snuck out . You have to be more careful . Smurfette , I know lately you may not realize , and I may not say it enough , but you are ... You shine . So , anyway , we 're smurfy ? I think you and the boys have been grounded long enough . Smurfette ? Okay . I 'm opening the door . And I 'm walking in to talk more . You there ? Smurfette . Hefty ! Brainy ! Clumsy ! That 's not
zone3	will ground them for a month of blue moons . What 's going on in here ? Well , all right . Have you ever seen something so beautiful ? Every day , Smurfette . Every day . - Do n't be weird . - You do n't be weird . We can camp here for the night . I 'll start us a fire . Fetch me some firewood , would you , Hefty ? A " please " would be nice . Yes , it would , but I have n't earned my manners badge , so get me some firewood . Clumsy ? You okay ? Yeah , sure . It 's been fun . Well , not tons of fun , but it 's had its moments . Kind of . You know what I 'm trying to say . It has n't been that much fun . Well done , Hefty . Well done . All right , step one , the wood should be stacked into a tepee-like structure . Step two , I tap this flint with a rock and ... You 're
zone3	it . That 's odd . Perhaps the wood you collected was damp , Hefty . According to my manual , it should spark right up . Hey , I 've got an idea . No , no , no . No , no ! No ! No , no , no . No , no , no ! You know , you 're right , Brain Man . Your little book does come in handy . Shame . Shame on you . We 'd be lost without this book . My name is Brainy . I 'm super smart . I 'm the smart Smurf . But I ca n't start a fire . Okay , the damage is minimal . The binding 's still intact . It smells good . Just think , guys . After all this time , while we 've been going about our smurfy business back home , there 's been other Smurfs out there , just like us . Or they could be nothing like us . He 's right . We should be prepared for whatever we find . Those other Smurfs
zone3	orange . I like orange . What if they all wear glasses ? Or have big , bushy mustaches . What if they have scaly skin and sharp teeth ? And giant claws . And big , beady eyes . What if they have hands ? Good one , bro . Listen , it does n't matter what they look like . We still have to warn them . Gargamel 's wrong about me . It 's not my purpose to help him . I 'm meant to save those Smurfs . And we 're gon na help you . We 're Team Smurf , and we 're in this together . And by " together , " I mean me and you . And those guys . But mostly me and you . Okay , everyone . Smurfy selfie time . - Say , " Blue cheese . " - Blue cheese ! According to the map , we should be arriving at a river . Check . It 's like a workout for my eyeballs . Okay , Bucky , let 's see how fast you can swim
zone3	. What 's a little water ? Hey . What 's that , Bucky ? The river 's unsafe and full of dangerous surprises at every bend ? No . I did n't get any of that . Perhaps Glowbunnies do n't swim . That 's too bad . We 'd get there so much faster . Fear not , my intrepid Team Smurf . I did n't earn this raft-building merit badge for nothing . - Nailed it . - Impressive , Brainy . Here . Stylish and practical . Now , let 's launch this bad boy . Wait . Remember , this strange river may hold untold surprises . - We must be cautious . - Cautious . Good point . - And heave ... - Wait . The currents can be unpredictable . We must be alert and vigilant . Vigilance ? Good call . - Now , on three , two ... - Wait ! We must make sure we always ... Pay attention to the ... Rate of speed of the ... Okay , and we are off . Heave-ho ! - Bye ,
zone3	n't worry , we 'll be fine . - Bye , little Bucky bro . - Hasta la bunny . - See you on the way back ! Hey . What is this thing ? I would n't touch that if I were you . Now all I want to do is touch it . At this pace , Gargamel does n't stand a chance . Look . If we follow this river , we 'll be right on course . Right on course . To the end of our rainbow . Smurfs ? I thought I left you for dead . Hang on , Smurf Crew . Gun it ! What the ... No . Stop ruining things . Ruining things is my thing . What ? Azrael , get me a bigger stick . Oh , dear . Clumsy , pull the lever ! Seriously ? But you said not to . Is this a trick ? Pull it now ! Oh , no . What 's this ? Azrael ! Do something . It 's never gon na stop . Make the log stop spinning . This
zone3	you two . - Yes ! We did it ! - We did it ! - See , I always believed we would do it . - Take that ! Help ! Help ! All right . We 're still on course . Double-time it , Hefty . Help ! I 'm sinking ! Please . I 'm afraid of turtles ! Guys , what 's he up to now ? - Help ! - Forget that guy . My cat ca n't swim . We got ta help him . - Are you crazy ? Why ? - Because it 's what I do . - Listen to him ! - But he 's our sworn enemy . He is literally a villain . I can change ! And I literally wear my heart on my sleeve , okay ? - That 's your shoulder , not a sleeve . - I like your tattoo ! - We 're doing this . - Smurfette , talk some sense into him . Brainy , I hate Gargamel more than anyone , but we 're Smurfs . - We do the
zone3	we have to save him . I just want to go on record that I 'm decisively against this . - Whatever . We 're doing it . - Sounds awesome ! - Use this . - Grab on ! I do n't know about this . You wo n't regret it . Thank you . Thank you . Such a kind Smurf . - Are you okay ? - I 'm okay . Wet , a little tired , kind of waterlogged . Thanks for asking , but ... I 'm still evil , so ... Enjoy drowning . Hope you 're better swimmers than you are judges of wizards ' character . Brainy . Hefty ? You okay ? Define " okay . " - Where 's Clumsy ? - Clumsy ! - Clumsy ! Clumsy ! - Clumsy ! Clumsy ! I 'm good . - Run away ! Run away ! - Hey . I think . My pack ! My manual ! No ! No , no , no ! No , no , no ! My Scout manual ! This is all your fault
zone3	. I 'm sorry . Correction . This is your fault , too . Leave her out of this . Hefty , I do n't need you to fight my fights for me . Wait , now you 're mad at me , too ? Smurfette , you 're the one that got us into this whole mess in the first place . Hey , I was ready to do this on my own . Great . So much for Team Smurf . - I want to yell about something ! - Stay out of this , Clumsy . That 's it , Brain Man . It 's time for you to earn your manners badge . Stop it ! Take cover ! Who are you ? What do you want ? Her . - Move . - Smurfette ! - What should we do with her ? - Look at that hair . - Where 's she from ? - And that dress . It 's you . You 're a girl . She 's a girl . This is her . This is the Smurf I was telling
zone3	's real ? I 'm Smurflily . Hi . I 'm Smurfette . Oh , my geez-to-petes ! I 'm Smurfblossom . Nice to meet you . We do n't have a Smurfette . But we do have Smurfpetal , Smurfclover , Smurfmeadow , Smurfdaisy , Smurfholly , Smurfhazel ... Hey . Everyone can just introduce themselves later . Look at you . You 're so different . I mean , sorry , but it 's true . Do you know how to start a fire with just rope and a stick ? I do . I can show you . Actually , Smurfstorm can show you . She 's the best at that kind of thing . Right , Stormy ? That means " yes . " Have you ever seen a rainbow ? What about a double rainbow ? What about an upside down rainbow ? So , is your favorite song ... Hey , hey , hey Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey ' Cause mine is . Your dress is so pretty . Smurfblossom , remember , work on that filter , okay
zone3	's your deal anyway ? Well , we came to warn you about Gargamel . - Garga ? - Garga ? Garga-what ? He 's a dangerous wizard who wants to capture all Smurfs and use them for his evil magic . And he knows about your lost village . " Lost village " ? You 're the one's who are lost , not us . We have to take you to Smurfy Grove . What do we do with these blue blobs ? Bring them along . Come on , Smurfette . I 'm gon na show you my room . You can tell me all about Gargasmell . But first , do you want to hear my favorite song again ? Hey , hey , hey Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey All right , move . - Girl Smurfs mean business . - You got that right . Open the gate ! The girls are back ! Where did they find them ? Is there something wrong with them ? - Are they sick ? - Are they food ? No , no ,
zone3	Except , well , they 're boy Smurfs . " Boy . " That 's a funny word . Boy . Boy . Boy . Boy . Look at me . I 'm a boy Smurf . - I like ' em . - Where do they come from ? - What is that ? - Look at their hair . - You can see their tails . - Look . - Hey , watch it ! - Brainy 's log , day two . We 've encountered a rare new life-form . Are there more like you ? They are at times very intimidating . - Are you gon na stay here ? - And they smell nice . - Hello , boy . - More on that later . - I want one ! - Boundaries ! Okay , that ... That 's enough of that ! They 're my friends . That 's Hefty , Brainy and Clumsy . - Hey , there ! - Hooptie , Berney , Klutzy . Got it . We should do name tags . Wait , where are your boys ?
zone3	Smurfwillow , leader of the Smurfs . This is called an introduction . So , now , you go . - I ... - Do n't get too close , Willow . Something 's not right here . I promise we 're only here to help . We came to warn you about the evil wizard , Gargamel . He has a map with a landmark leading him to three tall trees . - Show ' em , Brainy . - Snappy . Do n't try any funny stuff , bug . I hate to break it to you , but those are n't trees . They 're waterfalls . Gargamel 's going the wrong way . And if he went there , then that means the Swamp of No Return . There 's no way he could survive . Help me ! Help me ! There 's no way I 'll survive ! With all due respect , you do n't know Gargamel . Yeah , well , with no due respect , you do n't know us . Trust us , he 's a goner . Stormy ,
zone3	things out . And leave you here with these four ? No way . Look at that one . He ca n't be normal . I think we 'll be just fine here . Spitfire ! Okay . So , what does this Gargamel look like ? You know , he 's your typical wizard . Long black robe , lives alone with his cat and his bird . It 's sad , really . You 're coming with me . You can point him out . Hey . There 's no way he 's getting on a ... I feel the need to remind you , my name is Clumsy . Clumsy ! Do n't worry . Clumsy 's in good hands . Stormy is the sweetest , in her own way . All right , girls , in the meantime , our guests have had a long journey , so let 's show them some hospitality , Smurfy Grove style . Come on . Go . Hey , Smurfette , check this out . Come on ! Flap , Monty . Flap vigorously . Use your mighty condor
zone3	, they 're bottom feeders ! Devil fish ! Where is my lost Smurf village ? What ? Smurfs ! Why wo n't they just die ? Monty , retrieve them ! He exists , all right . He and his stinky cat and his dodo bird . They 've been terrorizing us the entire journey . He did n't like us from the start . He never could find our village . So then he made a plan to capture us all , and that 's when Gargamel created Smurfette . - Anyways ... - Hold up . Smurfette was created by this Gargamel ? Yeah . From a lump of clay . Really cool story , actually . I knew I did n't trust her . You 'd like her if you get to know her . She 's just like you , but nice . Hold on . We got a bogey coming in . That 's no bogey . That 's Gargamel 's big dumb bird ! Here , you fly . That 's not a great idea . Flying 's not really my thing .
zone3	Well , then how do you know it 's not your thing ? He 's coming back . - What do I ... - Hurry ! What do I do now ? Good move ! - Now , do it again ! - Okay . Thanks . Yes . Wait a minute . I do n't recognize that other Smurf . They found my lost Smurf village . Hey , I 've got an idea . Spitfire , spit fire ! I like the way you think . I guess I 'm pretty good with dragonflies after all . Monty ! What have they done to you , my glorious bird of prey ? Smurfs ! Shiatsu or Swedish ? Probably Swedish . So , about all that stuff I said back at the beach ... I guess I kind of overreacted . Yeah . Me , too . So , we good ? - Yeah , we 're good . - Hey , guys . Is n't this place awesome ? Does n't she look great ? It 's like she 's one of us now . She should
zone3	great . And two , this is getting a little out of hand , do n't you think ? Sorry . I ca n't take you seriously with that mask on your face . Hey , Smurfette , we did what we came here to do . These Smurfs know about Gargamel . So , come on , let 's start thinking about heading home . Home ? But I ... It 's time to go . Smurfette ? Incoming ! Turns out I do do well with dragonflies . They were right . This Gargamel character , he 's real , and he 's headed this way . Oh , no . See ? I told you ... Put a cork in it , Smurfette . The way I see it , you and your little boyfriends led him straight to us . But , of course , that was your plan all along , was n't it ? Smurfstorm , easy . Little Miss Yellow Hair is n't even a real Smurf . She was created by Gargamel . The Clumsy blob told me so himself . What
zone3	like that . She was made to help him find Smurfs . Smurfette came here to help you . We all did . It 's okay , Hefty . This is all my fault . Girls , protection mode . Come on , bro , let 's help . Is n't this exciting ? Hold . Hold . Now ! Surrender , wizard . What ? Wizard ? He 's so old . - Is he wearing a disguise ? - Look at his face . This is impossible . He does n't seem so tough . Yeah , Gargamel ! That 's what you get when you attack Smurfy Grove . - Gargamel ? What are you talking about ? - No , no , no , wait . This is a mistake . - What ? - Smurfette ? That 's Papa . - Papa ? - Papa ? There 's another funny word . Papa . Papa . Papa ! Smurfblossom , no . Breathe deep and step away from the Papa-thing . Everyone , meet Papa Smurf . Hey . - Hey . - Hi .
zone3	' Sup , Papa ? - Hello there . I rode a dragonfly ! Well , thank goodness you 're all okay . How did you find us ? I was n't born yesterday , you know . Yeah , that 's clear . Look , you four are coming home with me . Now . Not so fast , Papa-thing . " Papa-thing " ? Are you the one in charge here ? That 's right . I 'm Smurfwillow , leader of the Smurfs . I 'm afraid that 's quite impossible , because I happen to be the leader of the Smurfs . Whatever you say , Papa-thing . Excuse me , do you mind not calling me that ? Well , if the thing fits ... By the way , where 'd you learn those moves ? Self-taught , actually . Impressive . Thank you . You 're quite welcome . Okay , not really sure what 's happening here , but what about Gargamel ? What ? What is all this talk about Garga ... Gargamel ! I 'm sorry . Did I scare you
zone3	Everybody run ! - Arm yourselves ! Prepare for Garmageddon ! This way ! Spears , now ! Gargamel says freeze ! That 's right . Smurf-tested , Gargamel-approved , grade-A , first-class , high-octane freeze balls . Freeze ball ! Freeze ball ! Freeze ball ! Freeze ball ! Look out ! Well , I assume they 'll still work if I do n't shout " freeze ball , " but we 'll never know . - Freeze ball ! - Smurfette ! - Hefty . - It 's over , Smurfette . Monty , bag o ' Smurfs . It 's time for you to run . - No ! - Three more for pickup . Smurfette . My little creation . You finally did what you were made for . No . It 's not true . Of course it is . Why do you think you led me here ? Why do you think you saved me on the river ? It was all part of the plan . No matter how hard you try , you ca n't escape your destiny . And now ,
zone3	Freeze ball ! Yes , these freeze balls only work on real Smurfs . And you are nothing more than a lump of clay . Thank you for everything . Smurfette ? How could you do this to us ? Because it was her purpose . Smurfy Thing Finder for four small Smurfs . I 'm sorry , you guys . No , Snappy . I 've done too much damage already . We 're Team Smurf , and we 're in this together . We 're Smurfs . We do the right thing . I 'm not even a real Smurf . I 'm not a real Smurf . We need more power ! Faster , Monty . Faster . Yes . The jiggler 's jiggling . The spinny thing is spinning . The smoke is going up . The bubblers are bubbling . Perfect ! It 's almost there . Just keep running , old bird . Here 's what we 're going to do . - I pick this lock . - Yeah ? - We swing to that shelf . - Yeah ? - Pick up
zone3	kill the bird ! - Yeah ! What ? - Yeah ! Wait . You want us to kill the bird ? Fine . We 'll just knock him unconscious . - Genius ! - All right , then . Let 's do this . They have an escape plan , but they 're going to need our help . It 's time to rock the cage . Do n't be weird . Yes ! Okay . Now ! Stop that , Azrael . I ca n't calibrate my machine with all your incessant yammering . Yes , Azrael , listen to it . It purrs like a kitten . Look at that . Everything is in sync . Yes , yes . Good . Sweet mercy ! It 's another jailbreak ! - No , Gargamel . No . - Quiet down . You 'll all get your turn . In you go ! No ! Yes , that 's the stuff . It 's working , it 's working , it 's working I can feel it . I can feel the power . Check out my wizard
zone3	with these Smurfs , I 'll have all the power I 've ever dreamed of ! Almost all the power . Smurfette . Smurfette , what a lovely surprise . Are you done crying in the woods ? I 've shed enough tears for those Smurfs . What 's this ? I 'm done pretending to be something I 'm not . I 've come to repledge my loyalty to you , my true Papa . - Impossible . - She ca n't be serious . No , no , no , she would never . Even if I did believe you , which I do n't , what could you possibly offer me that I do n't already have ? A tiny little massage that I ca n't even feel ? How about the rest of the Smurfs ? Yeah , right . Wait , what ? Just think of all the power you 'll have once I reveal the location of Smurf Village . Let 's see now . One hundred more Smurfs , that 's ten times the power ... No . If you carry the one
zone3	Now , why are you doing this ? I 'm so tired of being good . Use your power to transform me back to my evil self . Your loyalty has returned to you . So , do we have a deal ? Smurfette , no ! Quiet , you vile blue rats . I 'm thinking . Okay , I 'm done . Let 's do it . One evil Smurfette coming right up ! Wait . Of course ! What ? What 's happening ? No ! No ! What are you doing ? Yeah ! Go , Smurfette ! Azrael , help ! More power ! What are we going to do ? Bingo . We Smurfboard . Team Smurf ! Payback time . No ! Smurfintine ! Smurfintine ! I 'm okay . Yeah ! I thought we were goners . All right . Everybody . Thank goodness . - All right ! - I 'm okay ! She did it ! She did it ! Where 's Smurfette ? Hey . Smurfette ? What happened ? This is what she once was . No .
zone3	be something I can do . There 's got ta be a spell . There 's got ta be something . I know there is . Where is it ? What page ? Must be here . " Alchemy , vanishing , lead into gold . " No , that 's not it . - Papa . - Which spell ? Which spell ? Papa . We wo n't find the answer to this in a book . Let 's take her home . She never thought she was a real Smurf . But she was the truest Smurf of all . Why is everyone crying ? It 's Smurfette . She 's a lump of clay . No , Clumsy , it 's me . I 'm right here . Smurfette ? It 's Smurfette . It 's Smurfette ! - Quiet , Clumsy . - Let him be , Brainy . We all grieve in our own way . - She 's here ! - Poor little bro . I know how he feels . Yeah ! Smurfette ! Hefty , not you , too . You 're
zone3	again . I wo n't . I promise . Yes , yes , yes ! You never cease to amaze me . So , as for that burning question ... What 's a Smurfette ? Well , I do n't need a book to tell you she 's ... Right . Smurfette ca n't be defined by just one word . She 's many things . She does n't know it yet , but she 's my new best friend . Smurfette is a bunny wrangler . She 's tough . Not as tough as me , but tough enough . Smurfette can be anything she wants to be . - What 's going on in there ? - Goodbye ! Say , " Blue cheese ! " Blue cheese ! I was this close to getting rid of the Smurfs , and you ruined everything . I knew I should have gotten a dog from the shelter . I 'm not saying this to be cruel , okay ? I 'm saying it to be constructive . You 're a useless feline . That 's just mean . That
zone3	crossed it . I was just jib-jabbing , and you crossed that line , and that stung . I demand an apology . You were going to learn this one way or another , but I am not your real father . But that does n't matter now . What matters is destroying the Smurfs . Any thoughts ? I mean , I have thoughts . But I always like to spitball off of your thoughts . Azrael , I 'm not going to sugarcoat this . Your ideas are terrible . I ca n't think with this music . Can someone please shut off the music ? And what 's with all these words scrolling in front of me ? Did the Smurfs do this so that I would be distracted and not be able to destroy them as easily ? " Matte painters " ? I do n't even know what that means . Someone just made that up , right ? I feel sorry for whoever " Matte " is . " Look development artists " ? Yes , of course , let 's develop some looks
zone3	two totally ruined my plans . Am I going mad , Azrael ? For the last time , get them to shut off this music !
